oil production quotas or other actions that might be imposed by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and
other producing countries; public health crises, such as pandemics (including coronavirus (COVID-19)) and epidemics, and any
related government policies and actions; changing economic, regulatory and political environments in the various countries in
which the company operates; general domestic and international economic and political conditions; changing refining, marketing
and chemicals margins; the company’s ability to realize anticipated cost savings, expenditure reductions and efficiencies associated
with enterprise transformation initiatives; actions of competitors or regulators; timing of exploration expenses; timing of crude oil
liftings; the competitiveness of alternate-energy sources or product substitutes; technological developments; the results of
operations and financial condition of the company’s suppliers, vendors, partners and equity affiliates, particularly during extended
periods of low prices for crude oil and natural gas during the COVID-19 pandemic; the inability or failure of the company’s joint-
venture partners to fund their share of operations and development activities; the potential failure to achieve expected net
production from existing and future crude oil and natural gas development projects; potential delays in the development,
construction or start-up of planned projects; the potential disruption or interruption of the company’s operations due to war,
accidents, political events, civil unrest, severe weather, cyber threats, terrorist acts, or other natural or human causes beyond the
company’s control; the potential liability for remedial actions or assessments under existing or future environmental regulations and
litigation; significant operational, investment or product changes required by existing or future environmental statutes and
regulations, including international agreements and national or regional legislation and regulatory measures to limit or reduce
greenhouse gas emissions; the potential liability resulting from pending or future litigation; the company’s ability to achieve the
anticipated benefits from the acquisition of Noble Energy, Inc.; the company’s future acquisitions or dispositions of assets or shares
or the delay or failure of such transactions to close based on required closing conditions; the potential for gains and losses from
asset dispositions or impairments; government mandated sales, divestitures, recapitalizations, industry-specific taxes, tariffs,
sanctions, changes in fiscal terms or restrictions on scope of company operations; foreign currency movements compared with the
U.S. dollar; material reductions in corporate liquidity and access to debt markets; the receipt of required Board authorizations to
pay future dividends; the effects of changed accounting rules under generally accepted accounting principles promulgated by rule-
setting bodies; the company’s ability to identify and mitigate the risks and hazards inherent in operating in the global energy
industry; and the factors set forth under the heading “Risk Factors” on pages 18 through 23 in this report. Other unpredictable or
unknown factors not discussed in this report could also have material adverse effects on forward-looking statements.

Item 1. Business
General Development of Business
Summary Description of Chevron
Chevron Corporation, a Delaware corporation, manages its investments in subsidiaries and affiliates and provides administrative,
financial, management and technology support to U.S. and international subsidiaries that engage in integrated energy and chemicals
operations. Upstream operations consist primarily of exploring for, developing, producing and transporting crude oil and natural
gas; processing, liquefaction, transportation and regasification associated with liquefied natural gas; transporting crude oil by major
international oil export pipelines; transporting, storage and marketing of natural gas; and a gas-to-liquids plant. Downstream
operations consist primarily of refining crude oil into petroleum products; marketing of crude oil, refined products and lubricants;
transporting crude oil and refined products by pipeline, marine vessel, motor equipment and rail car; and manufacturing and
marketing of commodity petrochemicals, plastics for industrial uses and fuel and lubricant additives.
A list of the company’s major subsidiaries is presented in Exhibit 21.1 on page E-1.
Overview of Petroleum Industry
Petroleum industry operations and profitability are influenced by many factors. Prices for crude oil, natural gas, petroleum products
and petrochemicals are generally determined by supply and demand. Production levels from the members of Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), Russia and the United States are the major factors in determining worldwide supply.
Demand for crude oil and its products and for natural gas is largely driven by the conditions of local, national and global
economies, although weather patterns and taxation relative to other energy sources also play a significant part. Laws and
governmental policies, particularly in the areas of taxation, energy and the environment, affect where and how companies invest,
conduct their operations and formulate their products and, in some cases, limit their profits directly.
Strong competition exists in all sectors of the petroleum and petrochemical industries in supplying the energy, fuel and chemical
needs of industry and individual consumers. In the upstream business, Chevron competes with fully integrated, major global
petroleum companies, as well as independent and national petroleum companies, for the acquisition of crude oil and natural gas
leases and other properties and for the equipment and labor required to develop and operate those properties. In its downstream
business, Chevron competes with fully integrated, major petroleum companies, as well as independent refining and marketing,
transportation and chemicals entities and national petroleum companies in the refining, manufacturing, sale and marketing of fuels,
lubricants, additives and petrochemicals.
Operating Environment
Refer to pages 31 through 38 of this Form 10-K in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations for a discussion of the company’s current business environment and outlook.
Chevron’s Strategic Direction
Chevron’s primary objective is to deliver higher returns, lower carbon and superior shareholder value in any business environment.
In the upstream, the company’s strategy is to deliver industry-leading returns while developing high-value resource opportunities.
In the downstream, the company’s strategy is to be the leading downstream and chemicals company that delivers on customer
needs. In seeking to help advance a lower carbon future, Chevron is focused on lowering its carbon intensity cost efficiently,
increasing renewables and offsets in support of its business, and investing in low-carbon technologies to enable commercial
solutions.
Information about the company is available on the company’s website at www.chevron.com. Information contained on the
company’s website is not part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The company’s Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly
Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and any amendments to these reports filed or furnished pursuant to
Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 are available free of charge on the company’s website soon after
such reports are filed with or furnished to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The reports are also available on
the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov.*
________________________________________________________
 Incorporated in Delaware in 1926 as Standard Oil Company of California, the company adopted the name Chevron Corporation in 1984 and ChevronTexaco Corporation in 2001. In 2005,
ChevronTexaco Corporation changed its name to Chevron Corporation. As used in this report, the term “Chevron” and such terms as “the company,” “the corporation,” “our,” “we,” “us”
and "its" may refer to Chevron Corporation, one or more of its consolidated subsidiaries, or all of them taken as a whole, but unless stated otherwise they do not include “affiliates” of
Chevron — i.e., those companies accounted for by the equity method (generally owned 50 percent or less) or non-equity method investments. All of these terms are used for convenience
only and are not intended as a precise description of any of the separate companies, each of which manages its own affairs.

Human Capital Management
Chevron is focused on investing in its employees and its culture. Chevron hires, develops, and strives to retain critical talent, and
fosters a culture that values diversity and inclusion and employee engagement, all of which support the company’s overall objective
to deliver industry leading performance. Chevron’s leadership reinforces and monitors the company’s investment in people and the
company’s culture. This includes reviews of metrics addressing critical function hiring, leadership development, attrition, diversity
and inclusion, and employee engagement.
The following table summarizes Chevron’s number of employees by gender, where data is available, and by region as of
December 31, 2020.

 Includes 5,108 service station employees; 2,312 and 1,672 new employees came from the 2020 Puma Energy (Australia) Holdings Pty. Ltd and Noble Energy, Inc. acquisitions,
respectively.
Hiring, Development and Retention
The company’s approach to attracting, developing and retaining its employees is anchored in a career-oriented employment model.
Chevron recruits new employees through partnerships with universities and diversity associations. In 2020, over 500 students
participated in the company’s first ever virtual internship program. In addition, the company recruits experienced hires to target
critical skills.
Development programs are designed to build leadership capabilities at all levels and ensure the company’s workforce has the
technical and operating capabilities to produce energy safely and reliably. Chevron’s leadership regularly reviews metrics on
employee training and development programs, which are continually evolving to better meet the needs of the business. For
instance, Chevron recently launched learning initiatives focused on digital innovation, including new Digital Academy and Digital
Scholars programs. In addition, to ensure business continuity, leadership regularly reviews the talent pipeline, identifies and
develops succession candidates, and builds succession plans for leadership positions. The Board provides oversight of CEO and
executive succession planning.
Chevron’s 2020 annual voluntary attrition was 4.1 percent, in line with its historical rates. The voluntary attrition rate generally
excludes employee departures under enterprise-wide restructuring programs. Chevron believes its low voluntary attrition rate is in
part a result of the company’s commitment to employee development and career advancement.
Diversity and Inclusion
Chevron is committed to advancing diversity and inclusion in the workplace so that employees are enabled to contribute to their
full potential. The company believes innovative solutions to its most complex challenges emerge when diverse people, ideas, and
experiences come together in an inclusive environment. Chevron reinforces the value of diversity and inclusion through
accountability, communication, training and personnel selection processes. Examples of initiatives to further advance diversity and
inclusion include the company’s Neurodiversity program through which the company employs neurodiverse individuals and
leverages their talents, its Elevate program which focuses on learning opportunities to promote a deeper understanding of
employees in underrepresented groups, and its Returnship initiative which provides support for women re-entering the workforce.
In addition, Chevron has twelve employee networks (voluntary groups of employees that come together based on shared identity or
interests) and more than fifteen diversity councils across its business units that help align diversity and inclusion efforts with
business strategies.1

Employee Engagement
Employee engagement is an indicator of employee well-being and commitment to the company’s values, purpose and strategies.
Chevron regularly conducts employee surveys to assess the health of the company’s culture. Recent surveys have indicated a high
degree of employee engagement. In 2020, the company’s employee survey focused on the COVID-19 impact on employee well-
being and the company’s response to the pandemic. The survey results positively reinforced actions taken by Chevron, and helped
inform further actions to address the impact on employees and their families through enhanced mental health and wellness support,
financial assistance for unplanned childcare needs and remote learning resources, among other efforts. The company also has long-
standing programs such as Ombuds, an independent resource designed to equip employees with options to address and resolve
workplace issues; a company hotline, where employees can report concerns to the Corporate Compliance department; and its
Employee Assistance Program, a confidential consulting service that can help employees resolve a broad range of personal, family
and work-related concerns or problems.
Description of Business and Properties
The upstream and downstream activities of the company and its equity affiliates are widely dispersed geographically, with
operations and projects in North America, South America, Europe, Africa, Middle East, Asia and Australia. Tabulations of
segment sales and other operating revenues, earnings and income taxes for the three years ending December 31, 2020, and assets as
of the end of 2020 and 2019 — for the United States and the company’s international geographic areas — are in Note 12 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page 74. Similar comparative data for the company’s investments in and income
from equity affiliates and property, plant and equipment are in Note 13 beginning on page 77 and Note 16 on page 82. Refer to
page 44 of this Form 10-K in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a
discussion of the company’s capital and exploratory expenditures.

Reserves
Refer to Table V beginning on page 103 for a tabulation of the company’s proved crude oil, condensate, natural gas liquids (NGLs),
synthetic oil and natural gas reserves by geographic area, at the beginning of 2018 and at each year-end from 2018 through 2020.
Reserves governance, technologies used in establishing proved reserves additions, and major changes to proved reserves by
geographic area for the three-year period ended December 31, 2020, are summarized in the discussion for Table V. Discussion is
also provided regarding the nature of, status of, and planned future activities associated with the development of proved
undeveloped reserves. The company recognizes reserves for projects with various development periods, sometimes exceeding five
years. The external factors that impact the duration of a project include scope and complexity, remoteness or adverse operating
conditions, infrastructure constraints, and contractual limitations.
At December 31, 2020, 27 percent of the company’s net proved oil-equivalent reserves were located in the United States, 18
percent were located in Australia and 20 percent were located in Kazakhstan.
The net proved reserve balances at the end of each of the three years 2018 through 2020 are shown in the following table:

Net Production of Liquids and Natural Gas
The following table summarizes the net production of liquids and natural gas for 2020 and 2019 by the company and its affiliates.
Worldwide oil-equivalent production of 3.083 million barrels per day in 2020 was up approximately 1 percent from 2019.
Production increases from shale and tight properties and the Noble Energy, Inc. (Noble) acquisition were partially offset by
production curtailments associated with OPEC and coordinating countries’ (OPEC+) restrictions and market conditions, and asset
sale related decreases of 100,000 barrels per day. Refer to the “Results of Operations” section beginning on page 37 for a detailed
discussion of the factors explaining the changes in production for crude oil, condensate, natural gas liquids, synthetic oil and natural
gas, and refer to Table V on pages 107 through 109 for information on annual production by geographical region.

Review of Ongoing Exploration and Production Activities in Key Areas
Chevron has exploration and production activities in many of the world’s major hydrocarbon basins. Chevron’s 2020 key upstream
activities, some of which are also discussed in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations, beginning on page 37, are presented below. The comments include references to “total production” and “net
production,” which are defined under “Production” in Exhibit 99.1 on page E-7.
The discussion that follows references the status of proved reserves recognition for significant long-lead-time projects not on
production as well as for projects recently placed on production. Reserves are not discussed for exploration activities or recent
discoveries that have not advanced to a project stage, or for mature areas of production that do not have individual projects
requiring significant levels of capital or exploratory investment.
United States
Upstream activities in the United States are primarily located in Texas, New Mexico, California, Colorado and the Gulf of Mexico.
Acreage for the United States can be found in the table on page 7. Net daily oil-equivalent production in the United States can be
found in the table on page 6.
With the acquisition of Noble in October 2020, Chevron increased its position in the Permian Basin and acquired acreage in
Colorado and Wyoming.
The company’s acreage in the Permian Basin of West Texas and southeast New Mexico includes multiple stacked formations that
enable production from several layers of rock in different geologic zones. Chevron has implemented a factory development strategy
in the basin, which utilizes multiwell pads to drill a series of horizontal wells that are completed concurrently using hydraulic
fracture stimulation. The company is also applying data analytics and technology to drive improvements in identifying well targets,
in drilling and completions and in production performance. In 2020, Chevron’s net daily unconventional and conventional
production in the Permian Basin averaged 294,000 barrels of crude oil, 980 million cubic feet of natural gas and 150,000 barrels of
NGLs.
In 2020, Chevron was one of the largest crude oil producers in California. Construction was completed in April 2020 on a new 29-
megawatt solar farm to supply power to the Lost Hills Field. In October 2020, Chevron announced participation in a carbon capture
trial in California with start-up expected in 2022.
In Colorado, development in the Denver-Julesburg (DJ) Basin includes Wells Ranch and Mustang areas. Chevron’s integrated
development plan provides an opportunity to efficiently produce these resources.
In Wyoming, the company has acreage in the Powder River and Green River Basins.
During 2020, net daily production in the Gulf of Mexico averaged 175,000 barrels of crude oil, 96 million cubic feet of natural gas
and 11,000 barrels of NGLs. Chevron is engaged in various operated and nonoperated exploration, development and production
activities in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Chevron also holds nonoperated interests in several shelf fields.
The deepwater Jack and St. Malo fields are being jointly developed with a host floating production unit located between the two
fields. Chevron has a 50 percent interest in the Jack Field and a 51 percent interest in the St. Malo Field. Both fields are company
operated. The company has a 40.6 percent interest in the production host facility, which is designed to accommodate production
from the Jack/St. Malo development and third-party tiebacks. Additional development opportunities for the Jack and St. Malo fields

extending beyond 2050.
Australia
Chevron is Australia's largest producer of LNG. Acreage can be found in the table on page 7. Net daily oil-equivalent production
can be found in the table on page 6.
Upstream activities in Australia are concentrated offshore Western Australia, where the company is the operator of two major LNG
projects, Gorgon and Wheatstone, and has a nonoperated working interest in the North West Shelf (NWS) Venture and exploration
acreage in the Carnarvon Basin.
Chevron holds a 47.3 percent-owned and operated interest in the Gorgon Project, which includes the development of the Gorgon
and Jansz-Io fields. The carbon dioxide system reached a full injection rate by first quarter 2020. Progress on the Gorgon Stage 2
project continued in 2020 with the completion of drilling of 11 subsea wells and is expected to be completed in 2022. The project's
estimated economic life exceeds 40 years.
FEED work continued in 2020 on the Jansz-Io Compression Project. The project supports maintaining gas supply to the Gorgon
LNG plant and maximizing the recovery of fields accessing the Jansz trunkline.
Chevron holds an 80.2 percent interest in the offshore licenses and a 64.1 percent-owned and operated interest in the LNG facilities
associated with the Wheatstone Project. The project includes the development of the Wheatstone and Iago fields, a two-train, 8.9
million-metric-ton-per-year LNG facility, and a domestic gas plant. The onshore facilities are located at
14
Ashburton North on the coast of Western Australia. The total production capacity for the Wheatstone and Iago fields and nearby
third-party fields is expected to be approximately 1.6 billion cubic feet of natural gas and 30,000 barrels of condensate per day. The
project’s estimated economic life exceeds 30 years.
Chevron has a 16.7 percent nonoperated working interest in the NWS Venture in Western Australia. In June 2020, Chevron
announced the decision to market its share in the NWS Venture with the data room opening in September 2020.
The company continues to evaluate exploration and appraisal activity across the Carnarvon Basin in which it holds more than 6.6
million net acres. During 2020, the company relinquished nonoperated working interests it held in the Browse Basin.
Chevron owns and operates the Clio, Acme and Acme West fields. The company is collaborating with other Carnarvon Basin
participants to assess the possibility of developing Clio and Acme through shared utilization of existing infrastructure.
Sales of Natural Gas and Natural Gas Liquids
 The company sells natural gas and NGLs from its producing operations under a variety of contractual arrangements. In addition,
the company also makes third-party purchases and sales of natural gas and NGLs in connection with its supply and trading
activities.
During 2020, U.S. and international sales of natural gas averaged 3.9 billion and 5.6 billion cubic feet per day, respectively, which
includes the company’s share of equity affiliates’ sales. Outside the United States, substantially all of the natural gas sales from the
company’s producing interests are from operations in Angola, Argentina, Australia, Bangladesh, Canada, Kazakhstan, Indonesia,
Israel, Myanmar, Nigeria and Thailand.
U.S. and international sales of NGLs averaged 233,000 and 120,000 barrels per day, respectively, in 2020.

natural gas.
Downstream
Refining Operations
At the end of 2020, the company had a refining network capable of processing 1.8 million barrels of crude oil per day. Operable
capacity at December 31, 2020, and daily refinery inputs for 2018 through 2020 for the company and affiliate refineries are
summarized in the table on the next page.
Average crude oil distillation capacity utilization was 76 percent in 2020 and 90 percent in 2019. At the U.S. refineries, crude oil
distillation capacity utilization averaged 73 percent in 2020, compared with 91 percent in 2019. Chevron processes both imported
and domestic crude oil in its U.S. refining operations. Imported crude oil accounted for about 59 percent and 65 percent of
Chevron’s U.S. refinery inputs in 2020 and 2019, respectively.
In the United States, the company continued work on projects to improve refinery flexibility and reliability. At the El Segundo
Refinery in California, enhancements are underway to enable production of renewable fuels including diesel, jet and gasoline from
bio-feedstocks. At the refinery in Salt Lake City, Utah, construction continued on the alkylation retrofit project with more than 100
modules installed. Project start-up is expected in second quarter 2021. The Pasadena Refinery enables processing of greater
amounts of Permian light crude oil and provides integration with Chevron’s Gulf Coast Pascagoula, Mississippi refinery and
Houston Blend Center.
Outside the United States, the company has three large refineries in South Korea, Singapore and Thailand. The Singapore Refining
Company (SRC), a 50 percent-owned joint venture, has a total capacity of 290,000 barrels of crude per day and manufactures a
wide range of petroleum products. Refinery upgrades have enabled SRC to produce higher-quality gasoline that meets stricter
emission standards. The 50 percent-owned, GS Caltex (GSC) operated, Yeosu Refinery in South Korea remains one of the world’s
largest refineries with a total crude capacity of 800,000 barrels per day. In 2020, progress continued on the olefins mixed-feed
cracker and associated polyethylene unit with first production expected second-half 2021. The company’s 60.6 percent-owned
refinery in Map Ta Phut, Thailand, continues to supply high-quality petroleum products through the Caltex brand into regional
markets.

research and development for additive component and blended packages. At the end of 2020, the company manufactured, blended
or conducted research at 10 locations around the world. Construction was completed in 2020 on a lubricant additive blending and
shipping plant in Ningbo, China. Commercial production is anticipated to begin in the second quarter 2021.
Chevron owns a 50 percent interest in Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC (CPChem). CPChem produces olefins,
polyolefins and alpha olefins and is a supplier of aromatics and polyethylene pipe, in addition to participating in the specialty
chemical and specialty plastics markets. At the end of 2020, CPChem owned or had joint-venture interests in 28 manufacturing
facilities and two research and development centers around the world.
CPChem holds a 51 percent interest in the US Gulf Coast II Petrochemical Project (USGC II) and a 30 percent interest in the Ras
Laffan Petrochemical Project (RLPP) in Qatar. Engineering and design were completed for USGC II in November 2020 and are
ongoing for the RLPP facility.
Chevron also maintains a role in the petrochemical business through the operations of GSC, the company’s 50 percent-owned
affiliate. GSC manufactures aromatics, including benzene, toluene and xylene. These base chemicals are used to produce a range of
products, including adhesives, plastics and textile fibers. GSC also produces polypropylene, which is used to make automotive and
home appliance parts, food packaging, laboratory equipment and textiles.
In 2020, progress continued on the construction of an olefins mixed-feed cracker and associated polyethylene unit within the
existing refining and petrochemical facilities in Yeosu, South Korea. First production is expected at the new plant in second-half
2021.
Transportation
Pipelines Chevron owns and operates a network of crude oil, natural gas and product pipelines and other infrastructure assets in the
United States. In addition, Chevron operates pipelines for its 50 percent-owned CPChem affiliate. The company also has direct and
indirect interests in other U.S. and international pipelines.
As a result of the Noble acquisition, Chevron acquired a majority interest in Noble Midstream Partners LP (Noble Midstream).
Noble Midstream is primarily focused in the DJ Basin in Colorado and Delaware Basin in Texas providing services to Chevron and
third-party customers. In February 2021, Chevron announced a non-binding offer to acquire all of the outstanding common units of
Noble Midstream Partners LP not already owned by Chevron or any of its affiliates.

set a target for OGCI members to reduce oil and gas carbon intensity.
Some of the investments the company makes in the areas described above are in new or unproven technologies and business
processes, and ultimate technical or commercial successes are not certain. Refer to Note 25 on page 95 for a summary of the
company’s research and development expenses.
Environmental Protection The company designs, operates and maintains its facilities to avoid potential spills or leaks and to
minimize the impact of those that may occur. Chevron requires its facilities and operations to have operating standards and
processes and emergency response plans that address significant risks identified through site-specific risk and impact assessments.
Chevron also requires that sufficient resources be available to execute these plans. In the unlikely event that a major spill or leak
occurs, Chevron also maintains a Worldwide Emergency Response Team comprised of employees who are trained in various
aspects of emergency response, including post-incident remediation.
To complement the company’s capabilities, Chevron maintains active membership in international oil spill response cooperatives,
including the Marine Spill Response Corporation, which operates in U.S. territorial waters, and Oil Spill Response, Ltd., which
operates globally. The company is a founding member of the Marine Well Containment Company, whose primary mission is to
expediently deploy containment equipment and systems to capture and contain crude oil in the unlikely event of a future loss of
control of a deepwater well in the Gulf of Mexico. In addition, the company is a member of the Subsea Well Response Project,
which has the objective to further develop the industry’s capability to contain and shut in subsea well control incidents in different
regions of the world.
The company is committed to improving energy efficiency in its day-to-day operations and is required to comply with the
greenhouse gas-related laws and regulations to which it is subject. Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors on pages 18 through 23 for
further discussion of greenhouse gas regulation and climate change and the associated risks to Chevron’s business.
Refer to Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations on page 49 for additional
information on environmental matters and their impact on Chevron, and on the company’s 2020 environmental expenditures. Refer
to page 49 and Note 22 beginning on page 92 for a discussion of environmental remediation provisions and year-end reserves.
Item 1A. Risk Factors
Chevron is a global energy company and its operating and financial results are subject to a variety of risks inherent in the global oil,
gas, and petrochemical businesses. Many of these risks are not within the company’s control and could materially impact the
company’s results of operations and financial condition.
BUSINESS, OPERATIONAL AND ACQUISITION-RELATED RISK FACTORS
Impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic have resulted in a significant decrease in demand for Chevron’s products and caused a
precipitous drop in commodity prices that has had, and may continue to have, an adverse and potentially material adverse effect
on Chevron’s financial and operating results.
As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the economic, business, and oil and gas industry impacts from the COVID-19
pandemic and the disruption to capital markets have continued to be far reaching. Crude oil prices, the single largest variable that
affects the company’s results of operations, fell to historic lows, even briefly going negative, due to a combination of a severely
reduced demand for crude oil, gasoline, jet fuel, diesel fuel, and other refined products resulting from government-mandated travel
restrictions and the curtailment of economic activity resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, a market imbalance has
existed and may continue to exist, with oil supplies exceeding current and expected near-term demand. Although OPEC members
and other countries have agreed to cut global oil supply, the commitments and actions to date have not matched the significant
decrease in global demand, which has resulted in increased inventory levels in refineries, pipelines and storage facilities in prior
periods and which may drive increased inventory levels in future periods.
18
Extended periods of low prices for crude oil are expected to have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations,
financial condition and liquidity. Among other things, the company’s earnings, cash flows, and capital and exploratory expenditure
programs may be negatively affected, as would its production volumes and proved reserves. As a result, the value of the company’s
assets may also become impaired in future periods, as we saw in 2020.
The company’s operations and workforce are being impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, causing certain operations to be
curtailed to various degrees. At 50 percent-owned Tengizchevroil in Kazakhstan, COVID-19 infections have led to the
demobilization of a significant portion of the workforce, adversely impacting the construction pace for completion of the
FGP/WPMP project. Although infection levels in Kazakhstan improved in the third quarter 2020, allowing remobilization of the
FGP/WPMP construction workforce to commence, a resurgence of infections prevented the final five percent of the planned
workforce from returning to work in the fourth quarter 2020, slowing progress on the project. The ultimate effects of COVID-19 on
FGP/WPMP construction remain uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time. In particular, we are currently unable to predict
whether COVID-19 will have a material adverse impact on our ability to complete FGP/WPMP on schedule or within the current
cost estimate for the project.
As a result of decreased demand for its products, the company made cuts to its upstream capital and exploratory expenditure
program for 2020, which are expected to negatively impact future production, have led to and could lead to further negative
revisions of reserves and could also lead to the further impairment of assets. Production curtailments, such as those due to the
reductions imposed by OPEC+ nations in Kazakhstan, Nigeria and Angola, and other production curtailment actions taken by
operators of assets for which the company has non-operated interests or due to market conditions, have exacerbated and may
continue to further exacerbate these negative impacts in future periods. Within downstream, the company reduced its capital
spending program and is also deferring certain discretionary maintenance activities while maintaining expenditures for asset
integrity and reliability. The company has reduced the utilization rates of its refineries in response to reduced demand for its
products, particularly greatly reduced demand for jet fuel due to the COVID-19 impact on travel and the aviation industry.
The company’s suppliers are also being impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and access to materials, supplies, and contract labor
has been strained. In certain cases, the company has received notices invoking force majeure provisions in supplier contracts. This
strain on the financial health of the company’s suppliers could put further pressure on the company’s financial results and may
negatively impact supply assurance and supplier performance. In-country conditions, including potential future waves of the
COVID-19 virus in countries that appear to have reduced their infection rates, could impact logistics and material movement and
remain a risk to business continuity.
In light of the significant uncertainty around the duration and extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, management is
currently unable to develop with any level of confidence estimates and assumptions that may have a material impact on the
company’s consolidated financial statements and financial or operational performance in any given period. In addition, the
unprecedented nature of such market conditions could cause current management estimates and assumptions to be challenged in
hindsight.
There continues to be uncertainty and unpredictability about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our financial and operating
results in future periods. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic adversely impacts our future financial and operating results,
and for what duration and magnitude, depends on several factors that are continuing to evolve, are difficult to predict and, in many
instances, are beyond the company's control. Such factors include the duration and scope of the pandemic, including any
resurgences of the pandemic, and the impact on our workforce and operations; the negative impact of the pandemic on the economy
and economic activity, including travel restrictions and prolonged low demand for our products; the ability of our affiliates,
suppliers and partners to successfully navigate the impacts of the pandemic; the actions taken by governments, businesses and
individuals in response to the pandemic; the actions of OPEC and other countries that otherwise impact supply and demand and
correspondingly, commodity prices; the extent and duration of recovery of economies and demand for our products after the
pandemic subsides; and Chevron’s ability to keep its cost model in line with changing demand for our products.
The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is evolving, and the continuation or a resurgence of the pandemic could precipitate or
aggravate the other risk factors identified in this Form 10-K, which in turn could further materially and adversely affect our
business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and profitability, including in ways not currently known or considered
by us to present significant risks.
Chevron is exposed to the effects of changing commodity prices Chevron is primarily in a commodities business that has a history
of price volatility. The single largest variable that affects the company’s results of operations is the price of crude
19
oil, which can be influenced by general economic conditions, industry production and inventory levels, technology advancements,
production quotas or other actions that might be imposed by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries or other producers,
weather-related damage and disruptions due to other natural or human causes beyond our control (including without limitation due
to the COVID-19 pandemic), competing fuel prices, and geopolitical risks. Chevron evaluates the risk of changing commodity
prices as a core part of its business planning process. An investment in the company carries significant exposure to fluctuations in
global crude oil prices.
Extended periods of low prices for crude oil can have a material adverse impact on the company’s results of operations, financial
condition and liquidity. Among other things, the company’s upstream earnings, cash flows, and capital and exploratory expenditure
programs could be negatively affected, as could its production and proved reserves. Upstream assets may also become impaired.
Downstream earnings could be negatively affected because they depend upon the supply and demand for refined products and the
associated margins on refined product sales. A significant or sustained decline in liquidity could adversely affect the company’s
credit ratings, potentially increase financing costs and reduce access to capital markets. The company may be unable to realize
anticipated cost savings, expenditure reductions and asset sales that are intended to compensate for such downturns. In some cases,
liabilities associated with divested assets may return to the company when an acquirer of those assets subsequently declares
bankruptcy. In addition, extended periods of low commodity prices can have a material adverse impact on the results of operations,
financial condition and liquidity of the company’s suppliers, vendors, partners and equity affiliates upon which the company’s own
results of operations and financial condition depends.
The scope of Chevron’s business will decline if the company does not successfully develop resources The company is in an
extractive business; therefore, if it is not successful in replacing the crude oil and natural gas it produces with good prospects for
future organic opportunities or through acquisitions, the company’s business will decline. Creating and maintaining an inventory of
projects depends on many factors, including obtaining and renewing rights to explore, develop and produce hydrocarbons; drilling
success; reservoir optimization; ability to bring long-lead-time, capital-intensive projects to completion on budget and on schedule;
and efficient and profitable operation of mature properties.
The company’s operations could be disrupted by natural or human causes beyond its control Chevron operates in both urban
areas and remote and sometimes inhospitable regions. The company’s operations are therefore subject to disruption from natural or
human causes beyond its control, including risks from hurricanes, severe storms, floods, heat waves, other forms of severe weather,
wildfires, ambient temperature increases, sea level rise, war, accidents, civil unrest, political events, fires, earthquakes, system
failures, cyber threats, terrorist acts and epidemic or pandemic diseases such as the COVID-19 pandemic, any of which could result
in suspension of operations or harm to people or the natural environment.
Chevron’s risk management systems are designed to assess potential physical and other risks to its operations and assets and to plan
for their resiliency. While capital investment reviews and decisions incorporate potential ranges of physical risks such as storm
severity and frequency, sea level rise, air and water temperature, precipitation, fresh water access, wind speed, and earthquake
severity, among other factors, it is difficult to predict with certainty the timing, frequency or severity of such events, any of which
could have a material adverse effect on the company's results of operations or financial condition.
Cyberattacks targeting Chevron’s process control networks or other digital infrastructure could have a material adverse impact
on the company’s business and results of operations There are numerous and evolving risks to Chevron’s cybersecurity and
privacy from cyber threat actors, including criminal hackers, state-sponsored intrusions, industrial espionage and employee
malfeasance. These cyber threat actors, whether internal or external to Chevron, are becoming more sophisticated and coordinated
in their attempts to access the company’s information technology (IT) systems and data, including the IT systems of cloud
providers and other third parties with whom the company conducts business. Although Chevron devotes significant resources to
prevent unwanted intrusions and to protect its systems and data, whether such data is housed internally or by external third parties,
the company has experienced and will continue to experience cyber incidents of varying degrees in the conduct of its business.
Cyber threat actors could compromise the company’s process control networks or other critical systems and infrastructure, resulting
in disruptions to its business operations, injury to people, harm to the environment or its assets, disruptions in access to its financial
reporting systems, or loss, misuse or corruption of its critical data and proprietary information, including without limitation its
intellectual property and business information and that of its employees, customers, partners and other third parties. Any of the
foregoing can be exacerbated by a delay or failure to detect a cyber incident or the full extent of such incident. Further, the
company has exposure to cyber incidents and the negative impacts of such incidents related to its critical data and proprietary
information housed on third-party IT
20
systems, including the cloud. Additionally, authorized third-party IT systems or software can be compromised and used to gain
access or introduce malware to Chevron's IT systems that can materially impact the company’s business. Regardless of the precise
method or form, cyber events could result in significant financial losses, legal or regulatory violations, reputational harm, and legal
liability and could ultimately have a material adverse effect on the company’s business and results of operations.
The company’s operations have inherent risks and hazards that require significant and continuous oversight Chevron’s results
depend on its ability to identify and mitigate the risks and hazards inherent to operating in the crude oil and natural gas industry.
The company seeks to minimize these operational risks by carefully designing and building its facilities and conducting its
operations in a safe and reliable manner. However, failure to manage these risks effectively could impair our ability to operate and
result in unexpected incidents, including releases, explosions or mechanical failures resulting in personal injury, loss of life,
environmental damage, loss of revenues, legal liability and/or disruption to operations. Chevron has implemented and maintains a
system of corporate policies, processes and systems, behaviors and compliance mechanisms to manage safety, health,
environmental, reliability and efficiency risks; to verify compliance with applicable laws and policies; and to respond to and learn
from unexpected incidents. In certain situations where Chevron is not the operator, the company may have limited influence and
control over third parties, which may limit its ability to manage and control such risks.
The company does not insure against all potential losses, which could result in significant financial exposure The company does
not have commercial insurance or third-party indemnities to fully cover all operational risks or potential liability in the event of a
significant incident or series of incidents causing catastrophic loss. As a result, the company is, to a substantial extent, self-insured
for such events. The company relies on existing liquidity, financial resources and borrowing capacity to meet short-term obligations
that would arise from such an event or series of events. The occurrence of a significant incident or unforeseen liability for which
the company is self-insured, not fully insured or for which insurance recovery is significantly delayed could have a material adverse
effect on the company’s results of operations or financial condition.
The Noble acquisition may cause our financial results to differ from our expectations or the expectations of the investment
community, we may not achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition, and the acquisition may disrupt our current plans or
operations.
The success of the Noble acquisition, which closed in October 2020, will depend, in part, on Chevron’s ability to realize the
anticipated benefits of the acquisition, including the anticipated annual run-rate operating and other cost synergies and accretion to
return on capital employed, free cash flow and earnings per share. Failure to realize anticipated synergies in the expected
timeframe, operational challenges, the diversion of management’s attention from ongoing business concerns, and unforeseen
expenses associated with the acquisition may have an adverse impact on our financial results.
One of our subsidiaries acts as the general partner of a publicly traded master limited partnership, Noble Midstream Partners
LP, which may involve a potential legal liability.
One of our subsidiaries acts as the general partner of Noble Midstream, a publicly traded master limited partnership. Our control of
the general partner of Noble Midstream may increase the possibility that we could be subject to claims of breach of duties owed to
Noble Midstream, including claims of conflict of interest. Any liability resulting from such claims could have a material adverse
effect on our future business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
LEGAL, REGULATORY AND ESG-RELATED RISK FACTORS
Chevron’s business subjects the company to liability risks from litigation or government action The company produces,
transports, refines and markets potentially hazardous materials, and it purchases, handles and disposes of other potentially
hazardous materials in the course of its business. Chevron's operations also produce byproducts, which may be considered
pollutants. Often these operations are conducted through joint ventures over which the company may have limited influence and
control. Any of these activities could result in liability or significant delays in operations arising from private litigation or
government action. For example, liability or delays could result from an accidental, unlawful discharge or from new conclusions
about the effects of the company’s operations on human health or the environment. In addition, to the extent that societal pressures
or political or other factors are involved, it is possible that such liability could be imposed without regard to the company’s
causation of or contribution to the asserted damage, or to other mitigating factors.
For information concerning some of the litigation in which the company is involved, see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements, beginning on page 78.
21
Political instability and significant changes in the legal and regulatory environment could harm Chevron’s business The
company’s operations, particularly exploration and production, can be affected by changing economic, regulatory and political
environments in the various countries in which it operates. As has occurred in the past, actions could be taken by governments to
increase public ownership of the company’s partially or wholly owned businesses, to force contract renegotiations, or to impose
additional taxes or royalties. In certain locations, governments have proposed or imposed restrictions on the company’s operations,
trade, currency exchange controls, burdensome taxes, and public disclosure requirements that might harm the company’s
competitiveness or relations with other governments or third parties. In other countries, political conditions have existed that may
threaten the safety of employees and the company’s continued presence in those countries, and internal unrest, acts of violence or
strained relations between a government and the company or other governments may adversely affect the company’s operations.
Those developments have, at times, significantly affected the company’s operations and results and are carefully considered by
management when evaluating the level of current and future activity in such countries. Further, Chevron is required to comply with
U.S. sanctions and other trade laws and regulations which, depending upon their scope, could adversely impact the company's
operations in certain countries. In addition, litigation or changes in national, state or local environmental regulations or laws,
including those designed to stop or impede the development or production of oil and gas, such as those related to the use of
hydraulic fracturing or bans on drilling, or any law or regulation that impacts the demand for our products, could adversely affect
the company’s current or anticipated future operations and profitability.
Legislation, regulation, and other government actions related to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and climate change could
continue to increase Chevron’s operational costs and reduce demand for Chevron’s hydrocarbon and other products Chevron
may be challenged by a further increase in international and domestic legislation, regulation, or other government actions relating
to GHG emissions and climate change. Like any significant changes in the regulatory environment, GHG and climate change-
related legislation and regulation could have the impact of curtailing profitability in the oil and gas sector or rendering the
extraction of the company’s oil and gas resources economically infeasible. Although the International Energy Agency’s (IEA)
World Energy Outlook scenarios anticipate oil and gas continuing to make up a significant portion of the global energy mix through
2040 and beyond, if new legislation, regulation, or other government action contributes to a decline in the demand for the
company’s products, this could have a material adverse effect on the company and its financial condition.
International agreements and national, regional, and state legislation and regulatory measures that aim to limit or reduce GHG
emissions are currently in various stages of implementation. For example, the Paris Agreement went into effect in November 2016,
and a number of countries are studying and may adopt additional policies to meet their Paris Agreement goals. In some
jurisdictions, the company is already subject to currently implemented programs such as the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard
program, the European Union Emissions Trading System, and the California cap-and-trade program and low carbon fuel standard
obligations. Other jurisdictions are considering adopting or are in the process of implementing laws or regulations to directly
regulate GHG emissions through similar or other mechanisms such as, for example, via a carbon tax (e.g., Singapore and Canada)
or via a cap-and-trade program (e.g., Mexico and China). Many governments are providing tax advantages and other incentives to
promote the use of alternative energy sources or lower-carbon technologies. The landscape continues to be in a state of constant re-
assessment and legal challenge with respect to these laws, regulations, and other actions, making it difficult to predict with certainty
the ultimate impact they will have on the company in the aggregate.
GHG emissions-related legislation, regulations, and government actions and the effects of operating in a potentially carbon-
constrained environment may result in increased and substantial capital, compliance, operating, and maintenance costs and could,
among other things, reduce demand for hydrocarbons and the company’s hydrocarbon-based products; make the company’s
products more expensive; adversely affect the economic feasibility of the company’s resources; and adversely affect the company’s
sales volumes, revenues, and margins. GHG emissions (e.g., carbon dioxide and methane) that could be regulated include, among
others, those associated with the company’s exploration and production of hydrocarbons; the upgrading of production from oil
sands into synthetic oil; power generation; the conversion of crude oil and natural gas into refined hydrocarbon products; the
processing, liquefaction, and regasification of natural gas; the transportation of crude oil, natural gas, and related products; and
consumers’ or customers’ use of the company’s hydrocarbon products. Indirect regulation of GHG emissions could include bans or
restrictions on technologies that use the company’s hydrocarbon products. Many of these activities, such as consumers’ and
customers’ use of the company’s products and substitute products, as well as actions taken by the company’s competitors in
response to such legislation and regulations, are beyond the company’s control.
22
Consideration of climate change-related issues and the responses to those issues through international agreements and national,
regional, or state legislation or regulations are integrated into the company’s strategy and planning, capital investment reviews, and
risk management tools and processes, where applicable. They are also factored into the company’s long-range supply, demand, and
energy price forecasts. These forecasts reflect long-range effects from renewable fuel penetration, energy efficiency standards,
climate change-related policy actions and demand response to oil and natural gas prices. The actual level of expenditure required to
comply with new or potential climate change-related laws and regulations and amount of additional investments in new or existing
technology or facilities, such as carbon dioxide injection, is difficult to predict with certainty and is expected to vary depending on
the actual laws and regulations enacted in a jurisdiction, the company’s activities in it, and market conditions.
The ultimate effect of international agreements; national, regional, and state legislation and regulation; and government actions
related to GHG emissions and climate change on the company’s financial performance, and the timing of these effects, will depend
on a number of factors. Such factors include, among others, the sectors covered, the GHG emissions reductions required, the extent
to which Chevron would be entitled to receive emission allowance allocations or would need to purchase compliance instruments
on the open market or through auctions, the price and availability of emission allowances and credits and the extent to which the
company is able to recover the costs incurred through the pricing of the company’s products in the competitive marketplace.
Further, the ultimate impact of GHG emissions and climate change-related agreements, legislation, regulation, and government
actions on the company’s financial performance is highly uncertain because the company is unable to predict with certainty, for a
multitude of individual jurisdictions, the outcome of political decision-making processes and the variables and tradeoffs that
inevitably occur in connection with such processes.
Increasing attention to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) matters may impact our business Increasing attention to
climate change, increasing societal expectations on companies to address climate change, and potential consumer and customer use
of substitutes to Chevron’s products may result in increased costs, reduced demand for our products, reduced profits, increased
investigations and litigation, and negative impacts on our stock price and access to capital markets. Increasing attention to climate
change, for example, may result in demand shifts for our hydrocarbon products and additional governmental investigations and
private litigation against the company.
In addition, organizations that provide information to investors on corporate governance and related matters have developed ratings
processes for evaluating companies on their approach to ESG matters. Such ratings are used by some investors to inform their
investment and voting decisions. Also, some stakeholders, including but not limited to sovereign wealth, pension, and endowment
funds, have been promoting divestment of fossil fuel equities and urging lenders to limit funding to companies engaged in the
extraction of fossil fuel reserves. Unfavorable ESG ratings and investment community divestment initiatives may lead to negative
investor sentiment toward Chevron and to the diversion of investment to other industries, which could have a negative impact on
our stock price and our access to and costs of capital.
GENERAL RISK FACTORS
Changes in management’s estimates and assumptions may have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial
statements and financial or operational performance in any given period In preparing the company’s periodic reports under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, including its financial statements, Chevron’s management is required under applicable rules and
regulations to make estimates and assumptions as of a specified date. These estimates and assumptions are based on management’s
best estimates and experience as of that date and are subject to substantial risk and uncertainty. Materially different results may
occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known. Areas requiring significant estimates and assumptions
by management include impairments to property, plant and equipment and investments in affiliates; estimates of crude oil and
natural gas recoverable reserves; accruals for estimated liabilities, including litigation reserves; and measurement of benefit
obligations for pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Changes in estimates or assumptions or the information underlying
the assumptions, such as changes in the company’s business plans, general market conditions or changes in commodity prices,
could affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities or expenses.

As previously disclosed, the refinery in Pasadena, Texas acquired by Chevron on May 1, 2019 (Pasadena Refining System, Inc. and
PRSI Trading LLC) has multiple outstanding Notices of Violation (NOVs) that were issued by the Texas Commission on
Environmental Quality related to air emissions at the refinery. The Pasadena refinery is currently negotiating a resolution of the
NOVs with the Texas Attorney General.
As previously disclosed, the California Department of Conservation, California Geologic Energy Management Division (CalGEM)
(previously known as the Division of Oil, Gas and Geothermal Resources) promulgated revised rules pursuant to the Underground
Injection Control program that took effect April 1, 2019. Subsequent to that date, CalGEM issued NOVs and two orders to Chevron
related to seeps that occurred in the Cymric Oil Field in Kern County, California. An October 2, 2019, CalGEM order seeks a civil
penalty of approximately $2.7 million. Chevron has filed an appeal of this order. Chevron is currently in discussions with CalGEM
to explore a global settlement to resolve the Order and all past and present seeps in the Cymric Field, which would increase the
amount of penalty paid.
Noble Energy Mediterranean Ltd. (Noble Mediterranean) received a notice of intent (NOI) from Israel’s Ministry of Environmental
Protection (MOEP) in April 2020 alleging breaches of the Leviathan facility’s effluent discharge permit for discharges that
occurred primarily before startup of the Leviathan facility and seeking an administrative monetary sanction of 10.8 million New
Israeli Shekels (NIS) (approximately 4.3 million NIS net to Noble Mediterranean’s 39.66 percent interest in the Leviathan facility),
pursuant to Israel’s Prevention of Sea Pollution from Land-Based Sources Law. Upon consideration of Noble Mediterranean’s
response to the NOI, the MOEP rescinded certain violations alleged in the NOI and reduced the penalty to 3.8 million NIS
(approximately $1.2 million gross and $465,000 net to Noble Mediterranean’s 39.66 percent interest), which was paid on December
11, 2020.
In January 2021, the United States Department of Justice and the United States Environmental Protection Agency notified Noble
Energy, Inc., Noble Midstream Partners LP and Noble Midstream Services, LLC of potential penalties for alleged Clean Water Act
violations at two facilities in Weld County, Colorado relating to a 2014 flood event and requirements for a Spill Prevention and
Countermeasures Plan and Facility Response Plan. The parties are negotiating a resolution of these issues with the agencies.
Resolution of these alleged violations may result in the payment of a civil penalty of $1,000,000 or more.

Business Environment and Outlook
Chevron is a global energy company with substantial business activities in the following countries: Angola, Argentina, Australia,
Bangladesh, Brazil, Canada, China, Egypt, Equatorial Guinea, Indonesia, Israel, Kazakhstan, Kurdistan Region of Iraq, Myanmar,
Mexico, Nigeria, the Partitioned Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, the Philippines, Republic of Congo, Singapore, South
Korea, Thailand, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Venezuela.
The company’s objective is to deliver higher returns, lower carbon and superior shareholder value in any business environment.
Earnings of the company depend mostly on the profitability of its upstream business segment. The most significant factor affecting
the results of operations for the upstream segment is the price of crude oil, which is determined in global markets outside of the
company’s control. In the company’s downstream business, crude oil is the largest cost component of refined products. Periods of
sustained lower prices could result in the impairment or write-off of specific assets in future periods and cause the company to
adjust operating expenses, including employee reductions, and capital and exploratory expenditures, along with other measures
intended to improve financial performance. Similarly, impairments or write-offs have occurred, and may occur in the future, as a
result of managerial decisions not to progress certain projects in the company’s portfolio.
With ongoing global interest in addressing the risks of climate change, support for policies and advancements in lower carbon
technologies is expected. In seeking to help advance a lower carbon future, Chevron is focused on lowering its carbon intensity cost
efficiently, increasing renewables and offsets in support of its business, and investing in low-carbon technologies to enable
commercial solutions.
Response to Market Conditions and COVID-19 During most of 2020, travel restrictions and other constraints on economic activity
designed to limit the spread of the COVID-19 virus were implemented in many locations around the world. These constraints
reduced demand for our products, and commodity prices fell, negatively impacting the company’s 2020 financial and operating
results. While demand and commodity prices have shown signs of recovery, demand is not back to pre-pandemic levels, and
financial results will likely continue to be challenged in future quarters. Due to the rapidly1,2

31
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
changing environment, there continues to be uncertainty and unpredictability around the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic
will impact our future results, which could be material.
Chevron entered this crisis well positioned with a strong balance sheet, flexible capital program and low cash flow breakeven price.
To protect its long-term health and value, the company took swift action, adjusting the items it can control. The company lowered
its capital expenditures 35 percent and lowered its operating expense, excluding non-recurring severance costs, by $1.4 billion
compared to 2019. The company completed an enterprise-wide transformation that is expected to capture additional cost
efficiencies. Additionally, the company suspended its stock repurchase program in March 2020. Taken together, these actions are
consistent with our financial priorities: to protect the dividend, to prioritize capital spend that drives long-term value, and to
maintain a strong balance sheet. The company expects to continue to have sufficient liquidity and access to both commercial paper
and debt capital markets due to its strong balance sheet and investment grade credit ratings. Additionally, the company has access
to nearly $10 billion in committed credit facilities.
The effective tax rate for the company can change substantially during periods of significant earnings volatility. This is due to the
mix effects that are impacted both by the absolute level of earnings or losses and whether they arise in higher or lower tax rate
jurisdictions. As a result, a decline or increase in the effective income tax rate in one period may not be indicative of expected
results in future periods. Note 15 provides the company’s effective income tax rate for the last three years.
Refer to the “Cautionary Statements Relevant to Forward-Looking Information” on page 2 and to “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A,
on pages 18 through 23 for a discussion of some of the inherent risks that could materially impact the company’s results of
operations or financial condition.
The company continually evaluates opportunities to dispose of assets that are not expected to provide sufficient long-term value or
to acquire assets or operations complementary to its asset base to help augment the company’s financial performance and value
growth. Asset dispositions and restructurings may result in significant gains or losses in future periods. The company’s asset sale
program for 2018 through 2020 targeted before-tax proceeds of $5-10 billion. For the three year period ending December 31, 2020,
assets sales proceeds totaled $7.7 billion, in the middle of the guidance range.
The company closely monitors developments in the financial and credit markets, the level of worldwide economic activity, and the
implications for the company of movements in prices for crude oil and natural gas. Management takes these developments into
account in the conduct of daily operations and for business planning.
Comments related to earnings trends for the company’s major business areas are as follows:
Upstream Earnings for the upstream segment are closely aligned with industry prices for crude oil and natural gas. Crude oil and
natural gas prices are subject to external factors over which the company has no control, including product demand connected with
global economic conditions, industry production and inventory levels, technology advancements, production quotas or other actions
imposed by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) or other producers, actions of regulators, weather-related
damage and disruptions, competing fuel prices, natural and human causes beyond the company’s control such as the COVID-19
pandemic, and regional supply interruptions or fears thereof that may be caused by military conflicts, civil unrest or political
uncertainty. Any of these factors could also inhibit the company’s production capacity in an affected region. The company closely
monitors developments in the countries in which it operates and holds investments, and seeks to manage risks in operating its
facilities and businesses. The longer-term trend in earnings for the upstream segment is also a function of other factors, including
the company’s ability to find or acquire and efficiently produce crude oil and natural gas, changes in fiscal terms of contracts, and
changes in tax and other applicable laws and regulations.
The company is actively managing its schedule of work, contracting, procurement, and supply chain activities to effectively
manage costs and ensure supply chain resiliency and continuity in support of operational goals. Third party costs for capital,
exploration, and operating expenses can be subject to external factors beyond the company’s control including, but not limited to:
the general level of inflation, tariffs or other taxes imposed on goods or services, and market based prices charged by the industry’s
material and service providers. Chevron utilizes contracts with various pricing mechanisms, so there may be a lag before the
company’s costs reflect the changes in market trends.
The spot markets and some of the current cost indexes for many materials and services have stabilized. Crude oil and natural gas
prices and demand have rebounded from lows of the early pandemic though demand still has not returned to pre-pandemic levels.
Drilling activity in the U.S. has risen slowly but steadily through the end of the year. The timing and
32
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
trajectory of any increase in the cost of materials and services going forward will depend on the extent of the oil and gas industry
recovery. Correlated with these initial signs of industry recovery and cost stabilization was a noticeable improvement in the risk of
default for key suppliers. To date, there have been no material impacts to operations due to supplier defaults. Chevron is actively
monitoring and engaging key suppliers to mitigate any potential business impacts.
Capital and exploratory expenditures and operating expenses could also be affected by damage to production facilities caused by
severe weather or civil unrest, delays in construction, or other factors.
The chart above shows the trend in benchmark prices for Brent crude oil, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil and U.S. Henry
Hub natural gas. The Brent price averaged $42 per barrel for the full-year 2020, compared to $64 in 2019. As of mid-
February 2021, the Brent price was $64 per barrel. The WTI price averaged $39 per barrel for the full-year 2020, compared to $57
in 2019. As of mid-February 2021, the WTI price was $60 per barrel. The majority of the company’s equity crude production is
priced based on the Brent benchmark.
Crude prices sharply declined at the end of the first and into the second quarter 2020 due to surplus supply as demand decreased
following government-imposed travel restrictions and other constraints on economic activity. In the second half of 2020, the
supply/demand balance slowly improved, primarily due to production cuts and demand growth, allowing prices to somewhat
recover. The company’s average realization for U.S. crude oil and natural gas liquids in 2020 was $31 per barrel, down 37 percent
from 2019. The company’s average realization for international crude oil and natural gas liquids in 2020 was $36 per barrel, down
38 percent from 2019.
Prices for natural gas are more closely aligned with seasonal supply-and-demand and infrastructure conditions in local markets. In
the United States, prices at Henry Hub averaged $1.98 per thousand cubic feet (MCF) during 2020, compared with $2.53 per MCF
during 2019. As of mid-February 2021, the Henry Hub spot price increased to $6.00 per MCF amid freezing temperatures across
much of the United States.
Outside the United States, prices for natural gas depend on a wide range of supply, demand and regulatory circumstances. The
company’s long-term contract prices for liquefied natural gas (LNG) are typically linked to crude oil prices. Most of the equity
LNG offtake from the operated Australian LNG projects is committed under binding long-term contracts, with the remainder to be
sold in the Asian spot LNG market. International natural gas realizations averaged $4.59 per MCF during 2020, compared with
$5.83 per MCF during 2019. (See page 41 for the company’s average natural gas realizations for the U.S. and international
regions.)
The company’s worldwide net oil-equivalent production in 2020 averaged 3.083 million barrels per day. About 14 percent of the
company’s net oil-equivalent production in 2020 occurred in the OPEC-member countries of Angola, Equatorial Guinea, Nigeria,
the Partitioned Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, Republic of Congo and Venezuela.
The company estimates that net oil-equivalent production in 2021 will grow up to 3 percent compared to 2020, assuming a Brent
crude oil price of $50 per barrel and excluding the impact of anticipated 2021 asset sales. This estimate is subject to many factors
and uncertainties, including quotas or other actions that may be imposed by OPEC+; price effects on entitlement volumes; changes
in fiscal terms or restrictions on the scope of company operations; delays in construction; reservoir performance; greater-than-
expected declines in production from mature fields; start-up or ramp-up of projects; fluctuations in demand for crude oil and natural
gas in various markets; weather conditions that may shut in production; civil unrest; changing geopolitics; delays in completion of
maintenance turnarounds; storage constraints or economic
33
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
conditions that could lead to shut-in production; or other disruptions to operations. The outlook for future production levels is also
affected by the size and number of economic investment opportunities and the time lag between initial exploration and the
beginning of production. The company has increased its investment emphasis on short-cycle projects, but these too are under
pressure in the current market environment.
In the Partitioned Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, production was shut-in beginning in May 2015. In December 2019, the
governments of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait signed a memorandum of understanding to allow production to restart in the Partitioned
Zone. In mid-February 2020, pre-startup activities commenced, and production resumed in July 2020. The financial effects from
the loss of production in 2019 and first half 2020 were not significant. During the fourth quarter 2020, oil equivalent production in
the Partitioned Zone averaged 40 thousand barrels per day.
Chevron has interests in Venezuelan crude oil assets, including those operated by Petropiar, Petroboscan and Petroindependiente.
While the operating environment in Venezuela has been deteriorating for some time, Petropiar, Petroboscan, and
Petroindependiente have conducted activities consistent with the authorization provided pursuant to general licenses issued by the
United States government. During the second quarter 2020, the company completed its evaluation of the carrying value of its
Venezuelan investments in line with its accounting policies and concluded that given the current operating environment and overall
outlook, which created significant uncertainties regarding the recovery of the company’s investment, an other than temporary loss
of value had occurred, which resulted in a full impairment of its investment in the country totaling $2.6 billion and change in
accounting treatment from equity method to non-equity method of accounting. As a result, the company also removed
approximately 160 million barrels of proved reserves and stopped reporting production in the country effective July 2020. The
company remains committed to its people, assets and operations in Venezuela.
Net proved reserves for consolidated companies and affiliated companies totaled 11.1 billion barrels of oil-equivalent at year-end
2020, a decrease of 3 percent from year-end 2019. The reserve replacement ratio in 2020 was 74 percent. The 5 and 10 year reserve
replacement ratios were 99 percent and 106 percent, respectively. Refer to Table V beginning on page 103 for a tabulation of the
company’s proved net oil and gas reserves by geographic area, at the beginning of 2018 and each year-end from 2018 through
2020, and an accompanying discussion of major changes to proved reserves by geographic area for the three-year period ending
December 31, 2020.
Response to Market Conditions and COVID-19: Upstream Travel restrictions and other constraints on global economic activity in
2020 in response to COVID-19 caused a significant decrease in demand for oil and gas. This led to lower price realizations across
all commodities. While critical asset integrity and reliability activities progressed throughout the year,
34
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
locations with high COVID-19 infection rates deferred non-essential work and demobilized non-essential personnel to reduce the
COVID-19 exposure risk to our workforce.
Despite the challenges posed by the pandemic, progress continues on the FGP/WPMP project at Tengiz. In the second quarter the
project construction workforce was demobilized to 20 percent of planned levels, which slowed the overall construction pace. In the
third quarter, the rate of infections in Kazakhstan slowed, allowing remobilization of the FGP/WPMP construction workforce to
begin. In the fourth quarter, staffing levels at FGP/WPMP returned to 95 percent of desired fourth quarter remobilization levels,
however a worldwide resurgence of infections prevented the remaining 5 percent of the workforce from returning to work and
slowed progress on the project. Extended rotations, COVID testing and isolation protocols are in place to minimize the spread of
the virus. Given the uncertain timeline for remobilizing all personnel and safely sustaining activity levels, it is too early to provide
meaningful information regarding impacts on project cost and schedule.
Facility maintenance turnarounds are being adjusted and, in certain cases, deferred into 2021. In some cases, turnarounds have been
extended in duration and/or reduced in scope in response to the pandemic. As a result of the reduction in capital expenditures, new
production is expected to be lower in the near term as drilling and completion activities are scaled back, most notably in the
Permian Basin, Gulf of Mexico, and Argentina. Exploration activities and projects not yet in execution phase have been deferred,
which may impact production in future years.
Production levels were curtailed in 2020 largely because of reductions imposed by OPEC+ nations in Kazakhstan, Nigeria and
Angola. In the fourth quarter, OPEC+ curtailments eased slightly relative to the third quarter. Production has also been curtailed
due to market conditions, most notably in Thailand. Additionally, operators of assets where the company has non-operated interests
also curtailed production. Production curtailments of approximately 106 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day were recorded in
2020. In the first quarter of 2021, we expect curtailments to be approximately 40 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day,
predominately related to OPEC+ restrictions.
Decreased capital expenditures, lower activity levels, delays in future development timing, and lower commodity prices have
resulted in reductions to Chevron’s proved reserve quantities for 2020. For more information on reserves, refer to Table V
beginning on page 103.
As some countries face a resurgence of the virus, regulatory and in-country conditions could impact logistics and material
movement and pose a risk to business continuity. We are taking precautionary measures to reduce the risk of exposure to and spread
of the COVID-19 virus through screening, testing and, when appropriate, quarantining workforce and visitors upon arrival to our
operated facilities.
Refer to the “Results of Operations” section on pages 37 and 38 for additional discussion of the company’s upstream business.
Downstream Earnings for the downstream segment are closely tied to margins on the refining, manufacturing and marketing of
products that include gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, lubricants, fuel oil, fuel and lubricant additives, and petrochemicals. Industry
margins are sometimes volatile and can be affected by the global and regional supply-and-demand balance for refined products and
petrochemicals, and by changes in the price of crude oil, other refinery and petrochemical feedstocks, and natural gas. Industry
margins can also be influenced by inventory levels, geopolitical events, costs of materials and services, refinery or chemical plant
capacity utilization, maintenance programs, and disruptions at refineries or chemical plants resulting from unplanned outages due to
severe weather, fires or other operational events.
Other factors affecting profitability for downstream operations include the reliability and efficiency of the company’s refining,
marketing and petrochemical assets, the effectiveness of its crude oil and product supply functions, and the volatility of tanker-
charter rates for the company’s shipping operations, which are driven by the industry’s demand for crude oil and product tankers.
Other factors beyond the company’s control include the general level of inflation and energy costs to operate the company’s
refining, marketing and petrochemical assets and changes in tax laws and regulations.
The company’s most significant marketing areas are the West Coast and Gulf Coast of the United States and Asia. Chevron
operates or has significant ownership interests in refineries in each of these areas.
Response to Market Conditions and COVID-19: Downstream Beginning in March 2020 and continuing into the first quarter 2021,
demand for refined products (primarily jet fuel and motor gasoline) has been below prior year levels as a result of travel restrictions
and other constraints on economic activity implemented in many countries to combat the spread of the COVID-19 virus. Product
prices also fell sharply, and although economic activity has somewhat rebounded from lows experienced in April, refining margins
continued to be at or near historic lows due to lower demand and pressure from
35
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
a global oil product surplus. Chevron continued to take steps to maximize diesel production, given the decline in jet fuel and motor
gasoline demand, to fuel transportation that keeps global supply chains moving. The company is actively monitoring supply and
demand dynamics as every region is experiencing different recovery trends. The company is adjusting the schedule for planned
maintenance activity across its refining network and idling certain processing units to adjust for lower demand, reduce costs,
manage inventories and, most importantly, protect the safety of employees and contractors.
As of mid-February 2021, Chevron’s refining crude utilization was approximately 80 to 85 percent and sales were down year-over-
year approximately 50 percent for jet fuel, approximately 5 percent for motor gasoline, while diesel sales were relatively flat. It is
unclear how long these conditions will persist, but the company will continue to take actions necessary to protect the health and
well-being of people, the environment and its operations as conditions evolve. Refer to the “Results of Operations” section on page
38 for additional discussion of the company’s downstream operations.
All Other consists of worldwide cash management and debt financing activities, corporate administrative functions, insurance
operations, real estate activities and technology companies.

U.S. Upstream
Millions of dollars 2020 2019 2018
Earnings (Loss) $ (1,608) $ (5,094)$ 3,278 
U.S. upstream reported a loss of $1.61 billion in 2020, compared with a loss of $5.09 billion in 2019. The smaller loss was largely
due to the absence of fourth quarter 2019 impairment charges of $8.17 billion, primarily associated with Appalachia shale and Big
Foot, partially offset by lower crude oil realizations of $3.36 billion and second quarter 2020 impairments and write-offs of $1.20
billion.
The company’s average realization for U.S. crude oil and natural gas liquids in 2020 was $30.53 per barrel compared with $48.54
in 2019. The average natural gas realization was $0.98 per thousand cubic feet in 2020, compared with $1.09 in 2019.
Net oil-equivalent production in 2020 averaged 1.06 million barrels per day, up 14 percent from 2019. Production increases from
shale and tight properties in the Permian Basin and 58,000 barrels per day of production from the Noble acquisition were partially
offset by normal field declines.
The net liquids component of oil-equivalent production for 2020 averaged 790,000 barrels per day, up 9 percent from 2019. Net
natural gas production averaged 1.61 billion cubic feet per day in 2020, up 31 percent from 2019.
International Upstream

37
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
higher charges of $1.4 billion for impairments and write-offs (charges of $3.6 billion in 2020 compared to $2.2 billion in 2019), and
lower crude oil sales volumes of $1.1 billion. Lower gains on asset sales of $730 million also contributed to the decrease and were
largely offset by lower operating expenses of $710 million. Foreign currency effects had a favorable impact on earnings of $38
million between periods.
The company’s average realization for international crude oil and natural gas liquids in 2020 was $36.07 per barrel compared with
$58.14 in 2019. The average natural gas realization was $4.59 per thousand cubic feet in 2020 compared with $5.83 in 2019.
International net oil-equivalent production was 2.03 million barrels per day in 2020, down 5 percent from 2019. The decrease was
due to production curtailments associated with OPEC+ restrictions and market conditions, and asset sale related decreases of
94,000 barrels per day, partially offset by higher production entitlement effects and volumes associated with the Noble acquisition.
The net liquids component of international oil-equivalent production was 1.08 million barrels per day in 2020, down 6 percent from
2019. International net natural gas production of 5.68 billion cubic feet per day in 2020 decreased 4 percent from 2019.
U.S. Downstream
Millions of dollars 2020 2019 2018
Earnings (Loss) $ (571) $ 1,559 $ 2,103 
U.S. downstream reported a loss of $571 million in 2020, compared with earnings of $1.56 billion in 2019. The decrease was
primarily due to lower margins on refined product sales of $1.08 billion and lower sales volumes of $1.00 billion. Lower equity
earnings from the 50 percent-owned CPChem of $220 million also contributed to the decrease. These were partially offset by lower
operating expenses of $220 million.
Total refined product sales of 1.00 million barrels per day in 2020 were down 20 percent from 2019, mainly due to lower jet fuel,
gasoline, and diesel demand associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.
International Downstream
Millions of dollars 2020 2019 2018
Earnings $ 618 $ 922 $ 1,695 
Includes foreign currency effects: $ (152) $ 17 $ 71 
International downstream earned $618 million in 2020, compared with $922 million in 2019. The decrease in earnings was largely
due to lower margins on refined product sales of $160 million, primarily resulting from unfavorable inventory effects. Unfavorable
tax items of $110 million also contributed to the decrease. Partially offsetting the decrease in earnings were lower operating
expenses of $130 million. Foreign currency effects had an unfavorable impact on earnings of $169 million between periods.
Total refined product sales of 1.22 million barrels per day in 2020 were down 8 percent from 2019, mainly due to lower jet fuel
demand associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.
All Other
Millions of dollars 2020 2019 2018
Net charges $ (3,157) $ (2,133)$ (2,290)
Includes foreign currency effects: $ (208) $ 2 $ (5)
All Other consists of worldwide cash management and debt financing activities, corporate administrative functions, insurance
operations, real estate activities, and technology companies.
Net charges in 2020 increased $1.02 billion from 2019. The change between periods was mainly due to the absence of the second
quarter 2019 Anadarko merger termination fee, higher pension expenses, severance and Noble acquisition costs, partially offset by
the absence of a prior year tax charge and favorable tax items. Foreign currency effects increased net charges by $210 million
between periods.*

Millions of dollars 2020 2019 2018 
Income tax expense (benefit) $ (1,892) $ 2,691 $ 5,715 
The decrease in income tax expense in 2020 of $4.58 billion is due to the decrease in total income before tax for the company of
$12.99 billion. The decrease in income before taxes for the company is primarily the result of lower crude oil prices partially offset
by lower impairments and project write off charges.
U.S. income before tax decreased from a loss of $5.48 billion in 2019 to a loss of $5.70 billion in 2020. This decrease in earnings
before tax was primarily driven by the effect of lower crude oil prices in the U.S. and the absence of the Anadarko merger fee,
partially offset by lower impairment charges and higher production. The U.S. tax benefit increased from $1.17 billion in 2019 to
$1.58 billion in 2020 primarily due to the increase in before-tax loss.
International income before tax decreased from $11.02 billion in 2019 to a loss of $1.75 billion in 2020. This decrease was
primarily driven by the effect of lower crude oil and natural gas prices, lower production, higher impairments and other charges.
The lower before-tax income primarily drove the $4.17 billion decrease in international income tax expense, from a charge of $3.86
billion in 2019 to a benefit of $308 million in 2020.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Sources and uses of cash
The strength of the company’s balance sheet enabled it to fund any timing differences throughout the year between cash inflows
and outflows.
Cash, Cash Equivalents, Marketable Securities and Time Deposits Total balances were $5.6 billion and $5.7 billion at
December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Cash provided by operating activities in 2020 was $10.6 billion, compared to $27.3
billion in 2019, primarily due to lower crude oil prices. Cash provided by operating activities was net of contributions to employee
pension plans of approximately $1.2 billion in 2020 and $1.4 billion in 2019. Cash provided by investing activities included
proceeds and deposits related to asset sales of $2.9 billion in 2020 and $2.8 billion in 2019.
Restricted cash of $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, was held in cash and short-term
marketable securities and recorded as “Deferred charges and other assets” and “Prepaid expenses and other current assets” on the
Consolidated Balance Sheet. These amounts are generally associated with upstream decommissioning activities, tax payments,
funds held in escrow for tax-deferred exchanges and refundable deposits related to pending asset sales.
Dividends Dividends paid to common stockholders were $9.7 billion in 2020 and $9.0 billion in 2019.
Debt and Finance Lease Liabilities Total debt and finance lease liabilities were $44.3 billion at December 31, 2020, up from $27.0
billion at year-end 2019.
The $17.3 billion increase in total debt and finance lease liabilities during 2020 was primarily due to the company's issuance of
long-term public bonds of $8.0 billion in May 2020 and $4.0 billion in August 2020, and the assumption of debt with a fair value of
$9.4 billion as part of the transaction to acquire Noble in October 2020. In January 2021, Chevron U.S.A. Inc. (CUSA) issued
bonds, guaranteed by Chevron Corporation, in exchange for the Noble debt. More information on bond issuances is included in
Note 18 on page 84. These amounts were partially offset by repayment of long-term notes that matured in 2020. The company’s
debt and finance lease liabilities due within one year, consisting primarily of commercial paper, redeemable long-term obligations
and the current portion of long-term debt, totaled $11.4 billion at December 31, 2020, compared with $13.0 billion at year-end
2019. Of these amounts, $9.825 billion and $9.75 billion were reclassified to long-term debt at the end of 2020 and 2019,
respectively.
At year-end 2020, settlement of these obligations was not expected to require the use of working capital in 2021, as the company
had the intent and the ability, as evidenced by committed credit facilities, to refinance them on a long-term basis.
The company has an automatic shelf registration statement that expires in August 2023 for an unspecified amount of
nonconvertible debt securities issued by Chevron Corporation or CUSA.
42
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The major debt rating agencies routinely evaluate the company’s debt, and the company’s cost of borrowing can increase or
decrease depending on these debt ratings. The company has outstanding public bonds issued by Chevron Corporation, CUSA,
Noble and Texaco Capital Inc. Most of these securities are the obligations of, or guaranteed by, Chevron Corporation and are rated
AA- by Standard and Poor’s Corporation and Aa2 by Moody’s Investors Service. The company’s U.S. commercial paper is rated
A-1+ by Standard and Poor’s and P-1 by Moody’s. All of these ratings denote high-quality, investment-grade securities.
The company’s future debt level is dependent primarily on results of operations, cash that may be generated from asset dispositions,
the capital program, lending commitments to affiliates and shareholder distributions. Based on its high-quality debt ratings, the
company believes that it has substantial borrowing capacity to meet unanticipated cash requirements. During extended periods of
low prices for crude oil and natural gas and narrow margins for refined products and commodity chemicals, the company has the
flexibility to modify capital spending plans and discontinue or curtail the stock repurchase program to provide flexibility to
continue paying the common stock dividend and also remain committed to retaining the company’s high-quality debt ratings.
Committed Credit Facilities Information related to committed credit facilities is included in Note 17, Short-Term Debt, on page 83.
Summarized Financial Information for Guarantee of Securities of Subsidiaries In August 2020, long-term public bonds were
issued by CUSA and fully and unconditionally guaranteed on an unsecured basis by Chevron Corporation (together the “Obligor
Group”). In March 2020, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued a final rule that amended the disclosure
requirements with respect to certain guaranteed securities registered or being registered in Rule 3-10 of Regulation S-X and
adopted new Rule 13-01 of Regulation S-X. These amendments were effective January 4, 2021. Accordingly, as disclosed in the
tables below, summary financial information is presented for Chevron Corporation, as Guarantor, excluding its consolidated
subsidiaries, and CUSA, as the issuer, excluding its consolidated subsidiaries. The summary financial information of the Obligor
Group is presented on a combined basis and transactions between the combined entities have been eliminated. Financial
information for non-guarantor entities has been excluded.

Common Stock Repurchase Program On February 1, 2019, the company announced that the Board of Directors authorized a new
stock repurchase program with a maximum dollar limit of $25 billion and no set term limits. As of December 31, 2020, the
company had purchased a total of 48.6 million shares for $5.5 billion, resulting in $19.5 billion remaining under the program
authorized in February 2019. On March 24, 2020, the company announced the suspension of the stock repurchase program in
response to depressed market conditions following the global outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. No shares were purchased
under the program after this announcement.
Repurchases may be made from time to time in the open market, by block purchases, in privately negotiated transactions or in such
other manner as determined by the company. The timing of the repurchases and the actual amount repurchased will depend on a
variety of factors, including the market price of the company’s shares, general market and economic
43
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
conditions, and other factors. The stock repurchase program does not obligate the company to acquire any particular amount of
common stock, and it may be suspended or discontinued at any time.
Capital and Exploratory Expenditures
Capital and exploratory expenditures by business segment for 2020, 2019 and 2018 are as follows:
2020 2019 2018
Millions of dollars U.S. Int’l. Total U.S. Int’l. Total U.S. Int’l. Total

Total reported expenditures for 2020 were $13.5 billion, including $4.0 billion for the company’s share of equity-affiliate
expenditures, which did not require cash outlays by the company. The acquisition of Noble is not included in the company’s capital
and exploratory expenditures. For more information on the Noble acquisition, see page 96 in Note 29. In 2019, expenditures were
$21.0 billion, including the company’s share of affiliates’ expenditures of $6.1 billion.
Of the $13.5 billion of expenditures in 2020, 81 percent, or $10.9 billion, related to upstream activities. Approximately 85 percent
was expended for upstream operations in 2019. International upstream accounted for 53 percent of the worldwide upstream
investment in 2020 and 54 percent in 2019.
The company estimates that 2021 organic capital and exploratory expenditures will be $14 billion, including $4.2 billion of
spending by affiliates. This is in line with 2020 expenditures, and reflects a robust portfolio of upstream and downstream
investments, highlighted by the FGP/WPMP project at the Tengiz field in Kazakhstan and the company’s Permian Basin position.
In the upstream business, approximately $6.5 billion is allocated to currently producing assets, including about $2.0 billion for
Permian unconventional development. Approximately $3.5 billion of the upstream program is planned for major capital projects
underway, of which about 75 percent is associated with FGP/WPMP at the Tengiz field in Kazakhstan. Additionally, $1.5 billion is
allocated to exploration, early stage development projects, and midstream activities. The company monitors crude oil market
conditions and is able to adjust future capital outlays should oil price conditions deteriorate.
Worldwide downstream spending in 2021 is estimated to be $2.1 billion, with $1.2 billion estimated for projects in the United
States.
Investments in technology businesses and other corporate operations in 2021 are budgeted at $0.4 billion.
Noncontrolling Interests The company had noncontrolling interests of $1.0 billion at December 31, 2020 and $1.0 billion at
December 31, 2019. Distributions to noncontrolling interests totaled $24 million and $18 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Included within noncontrolling interests for 2020 is $120 million of redeemable noncontrolling interest associated with Noble
Midstream.
Pension Obligations Information related to pension plan contributions is included beginning on page 87 in Note 21, Employee
Benefit Plans, under the heading “Cash Contributions and Benefit Payments.”

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Financial Ratios and Metrics
The following represent several metrics the company believes are useful measures to monitor the financial health of the company
and its performance over time:
Current Ratio Current assets divided by current liabilities, which indicates the company’s ability to repay its short-term liabilities
with short-term assets. The current ratio in all periods was adversely affected by the fact that Chevron’s inventories are valued on a
last-in, first-out basis. At year-end 2020, the book value of inventory was lower than replacement costs, based on average
acquisition costs during the year, by approximately $2.7 billion.
At December 31

Current liabilities 22,183 26,530 27,171 
Current Ratio 1.2 1.1 1.3
Interest Coverage Ratio Income before income tax expense, plus interest and debt expense and amortization of capitalized interest,
less net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, divided by before-tax interest costs. This ratio indicates the company’s
ability to pay interest on outstanding debt. The company’s interest coverage ratio in 2020 was lower than 2019 due to lower
income.

Does not include amounts related to the company’s income tax liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions. The company is unable to make reasonable estimates of the periods in
which such liabilities may become payable. The company does not expect settlement of such liabilities to have a material effect on its consolidated financial position or liquidity in any
single period.
$9.825 billion of short-term debt that the company expects to refinance is included in long-term debt. The repayment schedule above reflects the projected repayment of the entire
amounts in the 2022–2023 period. The amounts represent only the principal balance.
Excludes finance lease liabilities.
Does not include commodity purchase obligations that are not fixed or determinable. These obligations are generally monetized in a relatively short period of time through sales
transactions or similar agreements with third parties. Examples include obligations to purchase LNG, regasified natural gas and refinery products at indexed prices.

Financial and Derivative Instrument Market Risk
The market risk associated with the company’s portfolio of financial and derivative instruments is discussed below. The estimates
of financial exposure to market risk do not represent the company’s projection of future market changes. The actual impact of
future market changes could differ materially due to factors discussed elsewhere in this report, including those set forth under the
heading “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A.
Derivative Commodity Instruments Chevron is exposed to market risks related to the price volatility of crude oil, refined products,
natural gas, natural gas liquids, liquefied natural gas and refinery feedstocks. The company uses derivative commodity instruments
to manage these exposures on a portion of its activity, including firm commitments and anticipated transactions for the purchase,
sale and storage of crude oil, refined products, natural gas, natural gas liquids, liquefied natural gas and feedstock for company
refineries. The company also uses derivative commodity instruments for limited trading purposes. The results of these activities
were not material to the company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows in 2020.
The company’s market exposure positions are monitored on a daily basis by an internal Risk Control group in accordance with the
company’s risk management policies. The company’s risk management practices and its compliance with policies are reviewed by
the Audit Committee of the company’s Board of Directors.
Derivatives beyond those designated as normal purchase and normal sale contracts are recorded at fair value on the Consolidated
Balance Sheet with resulting gains and losses reflected in income. Fair values are derived principally from published market quotes
and other independent third-party quotes. The change in fair value of Chevron’s derivative commodity instruments in 2020 was not
material to the company’s results of operations.1

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The company uses the Monte Carlo simulation method as its Value-at-Risk (VaR) model to estimate the maximum potential loss in
fair value, at the 95 percent confidence level with a one-day holding period, from the effect of adverse changes in market conditions
on derivative commodity instruments held or issued. Based on these inputs, the VaR for the company’s primary risk exposures in
the area of derivative commodity instruments at December 31, 2020 and 2019 was not material to the company’s cash flows or
results of operations.
Foreign Currency The company may enter into foreign currency derivative contracts to manage some of its foreign currency
exposures. These exposures include revenue and anticipated purchase transactions, including foreign currency capital expenditures
and lease commitments. The foreign currency derivative contracts, if any, are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with
resulting gains and losses reflected in income. There were no material open foreign currency derivative contracts at December 31,
2020.
Interest Rates The company may enter into interest rate swaps from time to time as part of its overall strategy to manage the
interest rate risk on its debt. Interest rate swaps, if any, are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with resulting gains and
losses reflected in income. At year-end 2020, the company had no interest rate swaps.
Transactions With Related Parties
Chevron enters into a number of business arrangements with related parties, principally its equity affiliates. These arrangements
include long-term supply or offtake agreements and long-term purchase agreements. Refer to “Other Information” on page 77, in
Note 13, Investments and Advances, for further discussion. Management believes these agreements have been negotiated on terms
consistent with those that would have been negotiated with an unrelated party.

“MTBE.”

Environmental The following table displays the annual changes to the company’s before-tax environmental remediation reserves,
including those for U.S. federal Superfund sites and analogous sites under state laws.

The company records asset retirement obligations when there is a legal obligation associated with the retirement of long-lived
assets and the liability can be reasonably estimated. These asset retirement obligations include costs related to environmental
issues. The liability balance of approximately $13.6 billion for asset retirement obligations at year-end 2020 related primarily to
upstream properties.
For the company’s other ongoing operating assets, such as refineries and chemicals facilities, no provisions are made for exit or
cleanup costs that may be required when such assets reach the end of their useful lives unless a decision to sell or otherwise
decommission the facility has been made, as the indeterminate settlement dates for the asset retirements prevent estimation of the
fair value of the asset retirement obligation.
Refer to the discussion below for additional information on environmental matters and their impact on Chevron, and on the
company’s 2020 environmental expenditures. Refer to Note 22 on page 93 for additional discussion of environmental remediation
provisions and year-end reserves. Refer also to Note 23 on page 94 for additional discussion of the company’s asset retirement
obligations.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Other Contingencies Information related to other contingencies is included on page 93 in Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements under the heading “Other Contingencies.”
Environmental Matters
The company is subject to various international, federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws, regulations and
market-based programs. These laws, regulations and programs continue to evolve and are expected to increase in both number and
complexity over time and govern not only the manner in which the company conducts its operations, but also the products it sells.
For example, international agreements and national, regional, and state legislation and regulatory measures that aim to limit or
reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are currently in various stages of implementation. Consideration of GHG issues and the
responses to those issues through international agreements and national, regional or state legislation or regulations are integrated
into the company’s strategy and planning, capital investment reviews and risk management tools and processes, where applicable.
They are also factored into the company’s long-range supply, demand and energy price forecasts. These forecasts reflect long-range
effects from renewable fuel penetration, energy efficiency standards, climate-related policy actions, and demand response to oil and
natural gas prices. In addition, legislation and regulations intended to address hydraulic fracturing also continue to evolve at the
national, state and local levels. Refer to “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A, on pages 18 through 23 for a discussion of some of the
inherent risks of increasingly restrictive environmental and other regulation that could materially impact the company’s results of
operations or financial condition.
Most of the costs of complying with existing laws and regulations pertaining to company operations and products are embedded in
the normal costs of doing business. However, it is not possible to predict with certainty the amount of additional investments in new
or existing technology or facilities or the amounts of increased operating costs to be incurred in the future to: prevent, control,
reduce or eliminate releases of hazardous materials or other pollutants into the environment; remediate and restore areas damaged
by prior releases of hazardous materials; or comply with new environmental laws or regulations. Although these costs may be
significant to the results of operations in any single period, the company does not presently expect them to have a material adverse
effect on the company’s liquidity or financial position.
Accidental leaks and spills requiring cleanup may occur in the ordinary course of business. The company may incur expenses for
corrective actions at various owned and previously owned facilities and at third-party-owned waste disposal sites used by the
company. An obligation may arise when operations are closed or sold or at non-Chevron sites where company products have been
handled or disposed of. Most of the expenditures to fulfill these obligations relate to facilities and sites where past operations
followed practices and procedures that were considered acceptable at the time but now require investigative or remedial work or
both to meet current standards.
Using definitions and guidelines established by the American Petroleum Institute, Chevron estimated its worldwide environmental
spending in 2020 at approximately $2.0 billion for its consolidated companies. Included in these expenditures were approximately
$0.5 billion of environmental capital expenditures and $1.5 billion of costs associated with the prevention, control, abatement or
elimination of hazardous substances and pollutants from operating, closed or divested sites, and the decommissioning and
restoration of sites.
For 2021, total worldwide environmental capital expenditures are estimated at $0.5 billion. These capital costs are in addition to the
ongoing costs of complying with environmental regulations and the costs to remediate previously contaminated sites.
Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions
Management makes many estimates and assumptions in the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America (GAAP) that may have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements and related
disclosures and on the comparability of such information over different reporting periods. Such estimates and assumptions affect
reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Estimates
and assumptions are based on management’s experience and other information available prior to the issuance of the financial
statements. Materially different results can occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known.
The discussion in this section of “critical” accounting estimates and assumptions is according to the disclosure guidelines of the
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), wherein:
49
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
1.the nature of the estimates and assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to
account for highly uncertain matters, or the susceptibility of such matters to change; and
2.the impact of the estimates and assumptions on the company’s financial condition or operating performance is
material.
The development and selection of accounting estimates and assumptions, including those deemed “critical,” and the associated
disclosures in this discussion have been discussed by management with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. The areas
of accounting and the associated “critical” estimates and assumptions made by the company are as follows:
Oil and Gas Reserves Crude oil and natural gas reserves are estimates of future production that impact certain asset and expense
accounts included in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Proved reserves are the estimated quantities of oil and gas that
geoscience and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be economically producible in the future under existing
economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations. Proved reserves include both developed and undeveloped
volumes. Proved developed reserves represent volumes expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment
and operating methods. Proved undeveloped reserves are volumes expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled proved
acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion. Variables impacting Chevron’s
estimated volumes of crude oil and natural gas reserves include field performance, available technology, commodity prices, and
development and production costs.
The estimates of crude oil and natural gas reserves are important to the timing of expense recognition for costs incurred and to the
valuation of certain oil and gas producing assets. Impacts of oil and gas reserves on Chevron’s Consolidated Financial Statements,
using the successful efforts method of accounting, include the following:
1.Amortization - Capitalized exploratory drilling and development costs are depreciated on a unit-of-production (UOP)
basis using proved developed reserves. Acquisition costs of proved properties are amortized on a UOP basis using
total proved reserves. During 2020, Chevron’s UOP Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization (DD&A) for oil and
gas properties was $13.0 billion, and proved developed reserves at the beginning of 2020 were 6.4 billion barrels for
consolidated companies. If the estimates of proved reserves used in the UOP calculations for consolidated operations
had been lower by 5 percent across all oil and gas properties, UOP DD&A in 2020 would have increased by
approximately $700 million.
2.Impairment - Oil and gas reserves are used in assessing oil and gas producing properties for impairment. A significant
reduction in the estimated reserves of a property would trigger an impairment review. Proved reserves (and, in some
cases, a portion of unproved resources) are used to estimate future production volumes in the cash flow model. For a
further discussion of estimates and assumptions used in impairment assessments, see Impairment of Properties, Plant
and Equipment and Investments in Affiliates below.
Refer to Table V, “Reserve Quantity Information,” beginning on page 103, for the changes in proved reserve estimates for the three
years ended December 31, 2020, and to Table VII, “Changes in the Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows
From Proved Reserves” on page 111 for estimates of proved reserve values for each of the three years ended December 31, 2020.
This Oil and Gas Reserves commentary should be read in conjunction with the Properties, Plant and Equipment section of Note 1,
beginning on page 64, which includes a description of the “successful efforts” method of accounting for oil and gas exploration and
production activities.
Impairment of Properties, Plant and Equipment and Investments in Affiliates The company assesses its properties, plant and
equipment (PP&E) for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the
assets may not be recoverable. If the carrying value of an asset exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows expected from the asset,
an impairment charge is recorded for the excess of carrying value of the asset over its estimated fair value.
Determination as to whether and how much an asset is impaired involves management estimates on highly uncertain matters, such
as future commodity prices, operating expenses, production profiles, and the outlook for global or regional market supply-and-
demand conditions for crude oil, natural gas, commodity chemicals and refined products. However, the impairment reviews and
calculations are based on assumptions that are generally consistent with the company’s business plans and long-term investment
decisions. Refer also to the discussion of impairments of properties, plant and equipment in Note 16 on page 82 and to the section
on Properties, Plant and Equipment in Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” beginning on page 64.
50
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The company performs impairment assessments when triggering events arise to determine whether any write-down in the carrying
value of an asset or asset group is required. For example, when significant downward revisions to crude oil and natural gas reserves
are made for any single field or concession, an impairment review is performed to determine if the carrying value of the asset
remains recoverable. Similarly, a significant downward revision in the company’s crude oil or natural gas price outlook would
trigger impairment reviews for impacted upstream assets. In addition, impairments could occur due to changes in national, state or
local environmental regulations or laws, including those designed to stop or impede the development or production of oil and gas.
Also, if the expectation of sale of a particular asset or asset group in any period has been deemed more likely than not, an
impairment review is performed, and if the estimated net proceeds exceed the carrying value of the asset or asset group, no
impairment charge is required. Such calculations are reviewed each period until the asset or asset group is disposed. Assets that are
not impaired on a held-and-used basis could possibly become impaired if a decision is made to sell such assets. That is, the assets
would be impaired if they are classified as held-for-sale and the estimated proceeds from the sale, less costs to sell, are less than the
assets’ associated carrying values.
Investments in common stock of affiliates that are accounted for under the equity method, as well as investments in other securities
of these equity investees, are reviewed for impairment when the fair value of the investment falls below the company’s carrying
value. When this occurs, a determination must be made as to whether this loss is other-than-temporary, in which case the
investment is impaired. Because of the number of differing assumptions potentially affecting whether an investment is impaired in
any period or the amount of the impairment, a sensitivity analysis is not practicable.
In 2020, the company recorded impairments and write-offs for certain oil and gas properties primarily due to downward revisions
to its oil and gas price outlook. In addition, the company fully impaired its investments in Petropiar and Petroboscan after
completing an evaluation of the carrying value of its Venezuelan investments in line with its accounting policies and concluding
that given the current operating environment and overall outlook, which create significant uncertainties regarding the recovery of
the company’s investment, an other than temporary loss of value had occurred.
In 2019, the company recorded impairments and write-offs for certain oil and gas properties following the review and approval of
its business plan and capital expenditure program. As a result of the company’s disciplined approach to capital allocation and a
downward revision in its longer-term commodity price outlook, the company reduced funding to various natural gas-related
upstream opportunities including Appalachia shale, Kitimat LNG and other international projects. In addition, the revised long-term
oil price outlook resulted in an impairment of Big Foot.
A sensitivity analysis of the impact on earnings for these periods if other assumptions had been used in impairment reviews and
impairment calculations is not practicable, given the broad range of the company’s PP&E and the number of assumptions involved
in the estimates. That is, favorable changes to some assumptions might have avoided the need to impair any assets in these periods,
whereas unfavorable changes might have caused an additional unknown number of other assets to become impaired, or resulted in
larger impacts on impaired assets.
Asset Retirement Obligations In the determination of fair value for an asset retirement obligation (ARO), the company uses various
assumptions and judgments, including such factors as the existence of a legal obligation, estimated amounts and timing of
settlements, discount and inflation rates, and the expected impact of advances in technology and process improvements. A
sensitivity analysis of the ARO impact on earnings for 2020 is not practicable, given the broad range of the company’s long-lived
assets and the number of assumptions involved in the estimates. That is, favorable changes to some assumptions would have
reduced estimated future obligations, thereby lowering accretion expense and amortization costs, whereas unfavorable changes
would have the opposite effect. Refer to Note 23 on page 94 for additional discussions on asset retirement obligations.
Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans Note 21, beginning on page 87, includes information on the funded status of the
company’s pension and other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheet; the components of
pension and OPEB expense reflected on the Consolidated Statement of Income; and the related underlying assumptions.
The determination of pension plan expense and obligations is based on a number of actuarial assumptions. Two critical assumptions
are the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate applied to pension plan obligations. Critical
assumptions in determining expense and obligations for OPEB plans, which provide for certain health care and life insurance
benefits for qualifying retired employees and which are not funded, are the discount rate and the assumed health care cost-trend
rates. Information related to the company’s processes to develop these assumptions is included on page 89 in Note 21 under the
relevant headings. Actual rates may vary significantly from estimates because of unanticipated changes beyond the company’s
control.
51
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
For 2020, the company used an expected long-term rate of return of 6.5 percent and a discount rate for service costs of 3.3 percent
and a discount rate for interest cost of 2.6 percent for the primary U.S. pension plan. The actual return for 2020 was 9.4 percent. For
the 10 years ended December 31, 2020, actual asset returns averaged 7.9 percent for this plan. Additionally, with the exception of
three years within this 10-year period, actual asset returns for this plan equaled or exceeded 6.5 percent during each year.
Total pension expense for 2020 was $1.5 billion. An increase in the expected long-term return on plan assets or the discount rate
would reduce pension plan expense, and vice versa. As an indication of the sensitivity of pension expense to the long-term rate of
return assumption, a 1 percent increase in this assumption for the company’s primary U.S. pension plan, which accounted for about
67 percent of companywide pension expense, would have reduced total pension plan expense for 2020 by approximately $88
million. A 1 percent increase in the discount rates for this same plan would have reduced pension expense for 2020 by
approximately $269 million.
The aggregate funded status recognized at December 31, 2020, was a net liability of approximately $6.2 billion. An increase in the
discount rate would decrease the pension obligation, thus changing the funded status of a plan. At December 31, 2020, the company
used a discount rate of 2.4 percent to measure the obligations for the primary U.S. pension plan. As an indication of the sensitivity
of pension liabilities to the discount rate assumption, a 0.25 percent increase in the discount rate applied to the company’s primary
U.S. pension plan, which accounted for about 61 percent of the companywide pension obligation, would have reduced the plan
obligation by approximately $475 million, and would have decreased the plan’s underfunded status from approximately $3.2 billion
to $2.8 billion.
For the company’s OPEB plans, expense for 2020 was $57 million, and the total liability, all unfunded at the end of 2020, was $2.7
billion. For the primary U.S. OPEB plan, the company used a discount rate for service cost of 3.4 percent and a discount rate for
interest cost of 2.7 percent to measure expense in 2020, and a 2.4 percent discount rate to measure the benefit obligations at
December 31, 2020. Discount rate changes, similar to those used in the pension sensitivity analysis, resulted in an immaterial
impact on 2020 OPEB expense and OPEB liabilities at the end of 2020.
Differences between the various assumptions used to determine expense and the funded status of each plan and actual experience
are included in actuarial gain/loss. Refer to page 88 in Note 21 for more information on the $7.4 billion of before-tax actuarial
losses recorded by the company as of December 31, 2020, In addition, information related to company contributions is included on
page 91 in Note 21 under the heading “Cash Contributions and Benefit Payments.”
Business Combinations – Purchase-Price Allocation Accounting for business combinations requires the allocation of the
company’s purchase price to the various assets and liabilities of the acquired business at their respective fair values. The company
uses all available information to make these fair value determinations. Determining the fair values of assets acquired generally
involves assumptions regarding the amounts and timing of future revenues and expenditures, as well as discount rates. For
additional discussion of purchase price allocations, refer to Note 29 beginning on page 96.
Contingent Losses Management also makes judgments and estimates in recording liabilities for claims, litigation, tax matters and
environmental remediation. Actual costs can frequently vary from estimates for a variety of reasons. For example, the costs for
settlement of claims and litigation can vary from estimates based on differing interpretations of laws, opinions on culpability and
assessments on the amount of damages. Similarly, liabilities for environmental remediation are subject to change because of
changes in laws, regulations and their interpretation, the determination of additional information on the extent and nature of site
contamination, and improvements in technology.
Under the accounting rules, a liability is generally recorded for these types of contingencies if management determines the loss to
be both probable and estimable. The company generally reports these losses as “Operating expenses” or “Selling, general and
administrative expenses” on the Consolidated Statement of Income. An exception to this handling is for income tax matters, for
which benefits are recognized only if management determines the tax position is “more likely than not” (i.e., likelihood greater than
50 percent) to be allowed by the tax jurisdiction. For additional discussion of income tax uncertainties, refer to Note 22 beginning
on page 92. Refer also to the business segment discussions elsewhere in this section for the effect on earnings from losses
associated with certain litigation, environmental remediation and tax matters for the three years ended December 31, 2020.
An estimate as to the sensitivity to earnings for these periods if other assumptions had been used in recording these liabilities is not
practicable because of the number of contingencies that must be assessed, the number of underlying assumptions and the wide
range of reasonably possible outcomes, both in terms of the probability of loss and the estimates of such loss. For further
information, refer to “Changes in management’s estimates and assumptions may have a material

Management’s Responsibility for Financial Statements
To the Stockholders of Chevron Corporation
Management of Chevron Corporation is responsible for preparing the accompanying consolidated financial statements and the
related information appearing in this report. The statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America and fairly represent the transactions and financial position of the company. The
financial statements include amounts that are based on management’s best estimates and judgments.
As stated in its report included herein, the independent registered public accounting firm of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has
audited the company’s consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States).
The Board of Directors of Chevron has an Audit Committee composed of directors who are not officers or employees of the
company. The Audit Committee meets regularly with members of management, the internal auditors and the independent
registered public accounting firm to review accounting, internal control, auditing and financial reporting matters. Both the
internal auditors and the independent registered public accounting firm have free and direct access to the Audit Committee
without the presence of management.
The company’s management has evaluated, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
the effectiveness of the company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in the Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and
15d-15(e)) as of December 31, 2020. Based on that evaluation, management concluded that the company’s disclosure controls
are effective in ensuring that information required to be recorded, processed, summarized and reported, are done within the
time periods specified in the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms.
Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
The company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting,
as defined in the Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). The company’s management, including the Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over
financial reporting based on the Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on the results of this evaluation, the company’s management
concluded that internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2020.
The company excluded Noble from our assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020
because it was acquired by the company in a business combination during 2020. Total assets and total revenues of Noble, a
wholly-owned subsidiary, represent eight percent and one percent, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement
amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020.
The effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, has been audited by
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report included herein.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Chevron Corporation:
Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Chevron Corporation and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as
of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the related consolidated statements of income, of comprehensive income, of equity and of
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, including the related notes and financial
statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial
statements”). We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on
criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
the Treadway Commission (COSO).
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 2020 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)
issued by the COSO.
Basis for Opinions
The Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included
in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express
opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting
based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities
laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement,
whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects.
Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement
of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.
Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated
financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control
over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a
material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the
assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
As described in Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, management has excluded Noble Energy,
Inc. from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020 because it was acquired by the
Company in a purchase business combination during 2020. We have also excluded Noble Energy, Inc. from our audit of internal
control over financial reporting. Noble Energy, Inc. is a wholly-owned subsidiary whose total assets and total revenues excluded
from management’s assessment and our audit of internal control over financial reporting represent eight percent and one
percent, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures
that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the
company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
56
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.
 
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial
statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or
disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or
complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated
financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate
opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.
The Impact of Proved Crude Oil and Natural Gas Reserves on Upstream Property, Plant, and Equipment, Net
As described in Notes 1 and 16 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s upstream property, plant and
equipment, net balance was $140.2 billion as of December 31, 2020, and depreciation, depletion and amortization expense was
$18.0 billion, including impairments of $2.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020.  The Company follows the
successful efforts method of accounting for crude oil and natural gas exploration and production activities. Depreciation and
depletion of all capitalized costs of proved crude oil and natural gas producing properties, except mineral interests, are expensed
using the unit-of-production method, generally by individual field, as the proved developed reserves are produced. Depletion
expenses for capitalized costs of proved mineral interests are recognized using the unit-of-production method by individual field
as the related proved reserves are produced. As disclosed by management, variables impacting the Company’s estimated
volumes of crude oil and natural gas reserves include field performance, available technology, commodity prices, and
development and production costs. Reserves are estimated by Company asset teams composed of earth scientists and engineers.
As part of the internal control process related to reserves estimation, the Company maintains a Reserves Advisory Committee
(RAC) (the Company’s earth scientists, engineers and RAC are collectively referred to as “management’s specialists”). 
The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the impact of proved crude oil and
natural gas reserves on upstream property, plant, and equipment, net is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by
management, including the use of management’s specialists, when developing the estimates of proved crude oil and natural gas
reserves, which in turn led to (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and
evaluating audit evidence obtained related to the data, methods and assumptions used by management and its specialists in
developing the estimates of crude oil and natural gas reserve volumes. 
Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall
opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to
management’s estimates of proved crude oil and natural gas reserves. The work of management’s specialists was used in
performing the procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of the proved crude oil and natural gas reserve volumes. As a basis for
using this work, the specialists’ qualifications were understood and the Company’s relationship with the specialists was
assessed. The procedures performed also included evaluation of the methods and assumptions used by the specialists, tests of
the data used by the specialists and an evaluation of the specialists’ findings.
Acquisition of Noble Energy, Inc. - Valuation of Crude Oil and Natural Gas Properties
As described in Note 29 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company acquired Noble Energy, Inc. (“Noble”) in an
acquisition accounted for as a business combination, which required assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be measured at
their acquisition date fair values, including approximately $15 billion related to the fair values of acquired oil and gas
properties. Management applied significant judgment in estimating the fair value of properties acquired, which involved use of
a discounted cash flow approach that incorporated internally generated price assumptions and production profiles, and operating
cost and development cost assumptions.
The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of crude oil and natural
gas properties from the acquisition of Noble is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management, including
the use of management’s specialists as defined in the previous Critical Audit Matter, when developing the fair value
measurement of acquired crude oil and natural gas properties; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in
performing procedures and evaluating significant assumptions used in the discounted cash flow approach related to price,
production profiles and discount rates; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and
knowledge.

Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall
opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the
valuation of acquired crude oil and natural gas properties. These procedures also included, among others, (i) testing
management’s process for developing the fair value measurement of the acquired crude oil and natural gas properties; (ii)
evaluating the appropriateness of the discounted cash flow approach; (iii) testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying
data used in the discounted cash flow approach; and (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of significant assumptions used by
management related to price, production profiles and discount rates. Evaluating production profile assumptions involved
evaluating the reasonableness of the assumptions as compared to historical results of Noble, as well as third party data.
Evaluating price assumptions involved comparing the prices to third party data and underlying contracts. Professionals with
specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in the evaluation of the discounted cash flow approach and discount rates
used. The work of management’s specialists was used in performing the procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of the proved
crude oil and natural gas reserve volumes included in production profile assumptions as stated in the Critical Audit Matter titled
“The Impact of Proved Crude Oil and Natural Gas Reserves on Upstream Property, Plant, and Equipment, Net”. As a basis for
using this work, the specialists’ qualifications were understood, and the Company’s relationship with the specialists was
assessed. The procedures performed also included evaluation of the methods and assumptions used by the specialists, tests of
the data used by the specialists, and an evaluation of the specialists’ findings.

Note 1
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
General The company’s Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. These require the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the assets, liabilities,
revenues and expenses reported in the financial statements, as well as amounts included in the notes thereto, including discussion
and disclosure of contingent liabilities. Although the company uses its best estimates and judgments, actual results could differ
from these estimates as circumstances change and additional information becomes known.
Subsidiary and Affiliated Companies The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of controlled subsidiary
companies more than 50 percent-owned and any variable interest entities in which the company is the primary beneficiary.
Undivided interests in oil and gas joint ventures and certain other assets are consolidated on a proportionate basis. Investments in
and advances to affiliates in which the company has a substantial ownership interest of approximately 20 percent to 50 percent, or
for which the company exercises significant influence but not control over policy decisions, are accounted for by the equity
method.
Investments in affiliates are assessed for possible impairment when events indicate that the fair value of the investment may be
below the company’s carrying value. When such a condition is deemed to be other than temporary, the carrying value of the
investment is written down to its fair value, and the amount of the write-down is included in net income. In making the
determination as to whether a decline is other than temporary, the company considers such factors as the duration and extent of the
decline, the investee’s financial performance, and the company’s ability and intention to retain its investment for a period that will
be sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the investment’s market value. The new cost basis of investments in these
equity investees is not changed for subsequent recoveries in fair value.
Differences between the company’s carrying value of an equity investment and its underlying equity in the net assets of the affiliate
are assigned to the extent practicable to specific assets and liabilities based on the company’s analysis of the various factors giving
rise to the difference. When appropriate, the company’s share of the affiliate’s reported earnings is adjusted quarterly to reflect the
difference between these allocated values and the affiliate’s historical book values.
Noncontrolling Interests Ownership interests in the company’s subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent are presented
separately from the parent’s equity on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The amount of consolidated net income attributable to the
parent and the noncontrolling interests are both presented on the face of the Consolidated Statement of Income and Consolidated
Statement of Equity. Included within noncontrolling interest is redeemable noncontrolling interest.
Fair Value Measurements The three levels of the fair value hierarchy of inputs the company uses to measure the fair value of an
asset or a liability are as follows. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs
are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability. Level
3 inputs are inputs that are not observable in the market.
Derivatives The majority of the company’s activity in derivative commodity instruments is intended to manage the financial risk
posed by physical transactions. For some of this derivative activity, generally limited to large, discrete or infrequently occurring
transactions, the company may elect to apply fair value or cash flow hedge accounting. For other similar derivative instruments,
generally because of the short-term nature of the contracts or their limited use, the company does not apply hedge accounting, and
changes in the fair value of those contracts are reflected in current income. For the company’s commodity trading activity, gains
and losses from derivative instruments are reported in current income. The company may enter into interest rate swaps from time to
time as part of its overall strategy to manage the interest rate risk on its debt. Interest rate swaps related to a portion of the
company’s fixed-rate debt, if any, may be accounted for as fair value hedges. Interest rate swaps related to floating-rate debt, if any,
are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with resulting gains and losses reflected in income. Where Chevron is a party to
master netting arrangements, fair value receivable and payable amounts recognized for derivative instruments executed with the
same counterparty are generally offset on the balance sheet.
Inventories Crude oil, petroleum products and chemicals inventories are generally stated at cost, using a last-in, first-out method. In
the aggregate, these costs are below market. “Materials, supplies and other” inventories are primarily stated at cost or net realizable
value.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts
Properties, Plant and Equipment The successful efforts method is used for crude oil and natural gas exploration and production
activities. All costs for development wells, related plant and equipment, proved mineral interests in crude oil and natural gas
properties, and related asset retirement obligation (ARO) assets are capitalized. Costs of exploratory wells are capitalized pending
determination of whether the wells found proved reserves. Costs of wells that are assigned proved reserves remain capitalized.
Costs also are capitalized for exploratory wells that have found crude oil and natural gas reserves even if the reserves cannot be
classified as proved when the drilling is completed, provided the exploratory well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to
justify its completion as a producing well and the company is making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic
and operating viability of the project. All other exploratory wells and costs are expensed. Refer to Note 19, beginning on page 85,
for additional discussion of accounting for suspended exploratory well costs.
Long-lived assets to be held and used, including proved crude oil and natural gas properties, are assessed for possible impairment
by comparing their carrying values with their associated undiscounted, future net cash flows. Events that can trigger assessments
for possible impairments include write-downs of proved reserves based on field performance, significant decreases in the market
value of an asset (including changes to the commodity price forecast), significant change in the extent or manner of use of or a
physical change in an asset, and a more-likely-than-not expectation that a long-lived asset or asset group will be sold or otherwise
disposed of significantly sooner than the end of its previously estimated useful life. Impaired assets are written down to their
estimated fair values, generally their discounted, future net cash flows. For proved crude oil and natural gas properties, the
company performs impairment reviews on a country, concession, PSC, development area or field basis, as appropriate. In
Downstream, impairment reviews are performed on the basis of a refinery, a plant, a marketing/lubricants area or distribution area,
as appropriate. Impairment amounts are recorded as incremental “Depreciation, depletion and amortization” expense.
Long-lived assets that are held for sale are evaluated for possible impairment by comparing the carrying value of the asset with its
fair value less the cost to sell. If the net book value exceeds the fair value less cost to sell, the asset is considered impaired and
adjusted to the lower value. Refer to Note 7, beginning on page 71, relating to fair value measurements. The fair value of a liability
for an ARO is recorded as an asset and a liability when there is a legal obligation associated with the retirement of a long-lived
asset and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Refer also to Note 23, on page 94, relating to AROs.
Depreciation and depletion of all capitalized costs of proved crude oil and natural gas producing properties, except mineral
interests, are expensed using the unit-of-production method, generally by individual field, as the proved developed reserves are
produced. Depletion expenses for capitalized costs of proved mineral interests are recognized using the unit-of-production method
by individual field as the related proved reserves are produced. Impairments of capitalized costs of unproved mineral interests are
expensed.
The capitalized costs of all other plant and equipment are depreciated or amortized over their estimated useful lives. In general, the
declining-balance method is used to depreciate plant and equipment in the United States; the straight-line method is generally used
to depreciate international plant and equipment and to amortize finance lease right-of-use assets.
Gains or losses are not recognized for normal retirements of properties, plant and equipment subject to composite group
amortization or depreciation. Gains or losses from abnormal retirements are recorded as expenses, and from sales as “Other
income.”
Expenditures for maintenance (including those for planned major maintenance projects), repairs and minor renewals to maintain
facilities in operating condition are generally expensed as incurred. Major replacements and renewals are capitalized.
Leases Leases are classified as operating or finance leases. Both operating and finance leases recognize lease liabilities and
associated right-of-use assets. The company has elected the short-term lease exception and therefore only recognizes right-of-use
assets and lease liabilities for leases with a term greater than one year. The company has elected the practical expedient to not
separate non-lease components from lease components for most asset classes except for certain asset classes that have significant
non-lease (i.e., service) components.
Where leases are used in joint ventures, the company recognizes 100 percent of the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities when the
company is the sole signatory for the lease (in most cases, where the company is the operator of a joint venture). Lease costs reflect
only the costs associated with the operator’s working interest share. The lease term includes the committed lease term identified in
the contract, taking into account renewal and termination options that management is
65
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

reasonably certain to exercise. The company uses its incremental borrowing rate as a proxy for the discount rate based on the term
of the lease unless the implicit rate is available.
Goodwill Goodwill resulting from a business combination is not subject to amortization. The company tests such goodwill at the
reporting unit level for impairment annually at December 31, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that
would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount.
Environmental Expenditures Environmental expenditures that relate to ongoing operations or to conditions caused by past
operations are expensed. Expenditures that create future benefits or contribute to future revenue generation are capitalized.
Liabilities related to future remediation costs are recorded when environmental assessments or cleanups or both are probable and
the costs can be reasonably estimated. For crude oil, natural gas and mineral-producing properties, a liability for an ARO is made in
accordance with accounting standards for asset retirement and environmental obligations. Refer to Note 23, on page 94, for a
discussion of the company’s AROs.
For federal Superfund sites and analogous sites under state laws, the company records a liability for its designated share of the
probable and estimable costs, and probable amounts for other potentially responsible parties when mandated by the regulatory
agencies because the other parties are not able to pay their respective shares. The gross amount of environmental liabilities is based
on the company’s best estimate of future costs using currently available technology and applying current regulations and the
company’s own internal environmental policies. Future amounts are not discounted. Recoveries or reimbursements are recorded as
assets when receipt is reasonably assured.
Currency Translation The U.S. dollar is the functional currency for substantially all of the company’s consolidated operations and
those of its equity affiliates. For those operations, all gains and losses from currency remeasurement are included in current period
income. The cumulative translation effects for those few entities, both consolidated and affiliated, using functional currencies other
than the U.S. dollar are included in “Currency translation adjustment” on the Consolidated Statement of Equity.
Revenue Recognition The company accounts for each delivery order of crude oil, natural gas, petroleum and chemical products as
a separate performance obligation. Revenue is recognized when the performance obligation is satisfied, which typically occurs at
the point in time when control of the product transfers to the customer. Payment is generally due within 30 days of delivery. The
company accounts for delivery transportation as a fulfillment cost, not a separate performance obligation, and recognizes these
costs as an operating expense in the period when revenue for the related commodity is recognized.
Revenue is measured as the amount the company expects to receive in exchange for transferring commodities to the customer. The
company’s commodity sales are typically based on prevailing market-based prices and may include discounts and allowances. Until
market prices become known under terms of the company’s contracts, the transaction price included in revenue is based on the
company’s estimate of the most likely outcome.
Discounts and allowances are estimated using a combination of historical and recent data trends. When deliveries contain multiple
products, an observable standalone selling price is generally used to measure revenue for each product. The company includes
estimates in the transaction price only to the extent that a significant reversal of revenue is not probable in subsequent periods.
Stock Options and Other Share-Based Compensation The company issues stock options and other share-based compensation to
certain employees. For equity awards, such as stock options, total compensation cost is based on the grant date fair value, and for
liability awards, such as stock appreciation rights, total compensation cost is based on the settlement value. The company
recognizes stock-based compensation expense for all awards over the service period required to earn the award, which is the shorter
of the vesting period or the time period in which an employee becomes eligible to retain the award at retirement. The company’s
Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) awards include stock options and stock appreciation rights, which have graded vesting provisions
by which one-third of each award vests on each of the first, second and third anniversaries of the date of grant. In addition,
performance shares granted under the company’s LTIP will vest at the end of the three-year performance period. For awards
granted under the company’s LTIP beginning in 2017, stock options and stock appreciation rights have graded vesting by which
one third of each award vests annually on each January 31 on or after the first anniversary of the grant date. Standard restricted
stock unit awards have cliff vesting by which the total award will vest on January 31 on or after the fifth anniversary of the grant
date, subject to adjustment upon termination pursuant to the satisfaction of certain criteria. The company amortizes these awards on
a straight-line basis.

Fair Value Measurements
The tables on the next page show the fair value hierarchy for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring and
nonrecurring basis at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019.
Marketable Securities The company calculates fair value for its marketable securities based on quoted market prices for identical
assets. The fair values reflect the cash that would have been received if the instruments were sold at December 31, 2020.
Derivatives The company records its derivative instruments – other than any commodity derivative contracts that are designated as
normal purchase and normal sale – on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value, with the offsetting amount to the Consolidated
Statement of Income. Derivatives classified as Level 1 include futures, swaps and options contracts traded in active markets such as
the New York Mercantile Exchange. Derivatives classified as Level 2 include swaps, options and forward contracts principally with
financial institutions and other oil and gas companies, the fair values of which are obtained from third-party broker quotes, industry
pricing services and exchanges. The company obtains multiple sources of pricing information for the Level 2 instruments. Since
this pricing information is generated from observable market data, it has historically been very consistent. The company does not
materially adjust this information.
Properties, Plant and Equipment The company reported impairments for certain upstream properties during 2020 primarily due to
downward revisions to its oil and gas price outlook. The impact of these impairments is included in “Depreciation, depletion and
amortization” on the Consolidated Statement of Income. The company reported impairments for certain upstream properties in
2019 primarily due to capital allocation decisions and a lower long-term commodity price outlook.
Investments and Advances In 2020, the company fully impaired its investments in Petropiar and Petroboscan in Venezuela. The
impact of these impairments is included in “Income (loss) from equity affiliates” on the Consolidated Statement of Income. The
company reported impairments for certain upstream equity companies in 2019 primarily due to capital allocation decisions and
lower long-term commodity price outlook.

At year-end 2020, the company had assets measured at fair value Level 3 using unobservable inputs of $2,451. The carrying value
of these assets were written down to fair value based on estimates derived from internal discounted cash flow models. Cash flows
were determined using estimates of future production, an outlook of future price based on published prices and a discount rate
believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants. The significant Level 3 inputs were attributed to two
assets, one in an international location where volumes and price were primarily based on natural gas, and the second was in a U.S.
location where volumes and price were primarily based on crude.
Assets and Liabilities Not Required to Be Measured at Fair Value The company holds cash equivalents and time deposits in U.S.
and non-U.S. portfolios. The instruments classified as cash equivalents are primarily bank time deposits with maturities of 90 days
or less and money market funds. “Cash and cash equivalents” had carrying/fair values of $5,596 and $5,686 at December 31, 2020,
and December 31, 2019, respectively. The fair values of cash, cash equivalents and bank time deposits are classified as Level 1 and
reflect the cash that would have been received if the instruments were settled at December 31, 2020.
“Cash and cash equivalents” do not include investments with a carrying/fair value of $1,141 and $1,225 at December 31, 2020, and
December 31, 2019, respectively. At December 31, 2020, these investments are classified as Level 1 and include restricted funds
related to certain upstream decommissioning activities, tax payments and a financing program, which are reported in “Deferred
charges and other assets” on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Long-term debt, excluding finance lease liabilities, of $30,805 and
$13,659 at December 31, 2020, and December 31, 2019, respectively, had estimated fair values of $34,390 and $14,326,
respectively. Long-term debt primarily includes corporate issued bonds. The fair value of corporate bonds is $32,123 and classified
as Level 1. The fair value of other long-term debt is $2,267 and classified as Level 2.
The carrying values of short-term financial assets and liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet approximate their fair values.
Fair value remeasurements of other financial instruments at December 31, 2020 and 2019, were not material.
Note 8
Financial and Derivative Instruments
Derivative Commodity Instruments The company’s derivative commodity instruments principally include crude oil, natural gas
and refined product futures, swaps, options, and forward contracts. None of the company’s derivative instruments is designated as a
hedging instrument, although certain of the company’s affiliates make such designation. The company’s derivatives are not material
to the company’s financial position, results of operations or liquidity. The company believes it has no material market or credit risks
to its operations, financial position or liquidity as a result of its commodity derivative activities.
72
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts
The company uses derivative commodity instruments traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange and on electronic platforms of
the Inter-Continental Exchange and Chicago Mercantile Exchange. In addition, the company enters into swap contracts and option
contracts principally with major financial institutions and other oil and gas companies in the “over-the-counter” markets, which are
governed by International Swaps and Derivatives Association agreements and other master netting arrangements. Depending on the
nature of the derivative transactions, bilateral collateral arrangements may also be required.
Derivative instruments measured at fair value at December 31, 2020, December 31, 2019, and December 31, 2018, and their
classification on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and Consolidated Statement of Income are below:

At December 31, 2019
Derivative Assets $ 656 $ 645 $ 11 $ — $ 11 
Derivative Liabilities $ 719 $ 645 $ 74 $ — $ 74 
Derivative assets and liabilities are classified on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as accounts and notes receivable, long-term
receivables, accounts payable, and deferred credits and other noncurrent obligations. Amounts not offset on the Consolidated
Balance Sheet represent positions that do not meet all the conditions for “a right of offset.”
Concentrations of Credit Risk The company’s financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist
primarily of its cash equivalents, time deposits, marketable securities, derivative financial instruments and trade receivables. The
company’s short-term investments are placed with a wide array of financial institutions with high credit ratings. Company
investment policies limit the company’s exposure both to credit risk and to concentrations of credit risk. Similar policies on
diversification and creditworthiness are applied to the company’s counterparties in derivative instruments.
The trade receivable balances, reflecting the company’s diversified sources of revenue, are dispersed among the company’s broad
customer base worldwide. As a result, the company believes concentrations of credit risk are limited. The company routinely
assesses the financial strength of its customers. When the financial strength of a customer is not considered sufficient, alternative
risk mitigation measures may be deployed, including requiring pre-payments, letters of credit or other acceptable collateral
instruments to support sales to customers.

At December 31, 2020, about 67 million shares of Chevron’s common stock remained available for issuance from the 260 million
shares that were reserved for issuance under the Chevron Long-Term Incentive Plan. In addition, 644,376 shares remain available
for issuance from the 1,600,000 shares of the company’s common stock that were reserved for awards under the Chevron
Corporation Non-Employee Directors’ Equity Compensation and Deferral Plan.

Earnings Per Share
Basic earnings per share (EPS) is based upon “Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Chevron Corporation” (“earnings”) and includes
the effects of deferrals of salary and other compensation awards that are invested in Chevron stock units by certain officers and
employees of the company. Diluted EPS includes the effects of these items as well as the dilutive effects of outstanding stock
options awarded under the company’s stock option programs (refer to Note 20, “Stock Options and Other Share-Based
Compensation,” beginning on page 86). The table below sets forth the computation of basic and diluted EPS:

There was no effect of dividend equivalents paid on stock units or dilutive impact of employee stock-based awards on earnings.
 Millions of shares; 1 million shares of employee-based awards were not included in the 2020 diluted EPS calculation as the result would be anti-dilutive.

Operating Segments and Geographic Data
Although each subsidiary of Chevron is responsible for its own affairs, Chevron Corporation manages its investments in these
subsidiaries and their affiliates. The investments are grouped into two business segments, Upstream and Downstream, representing
the company’s “reportable segments” and “operating segments.” Upstream operations consist primarily of exploring for,
developing, producing and transporting crude oil and natural gas; liquefaction, transportation and regasification associated with
liquefied natural gas (LNG); transporting crude oil by major international oil export pipelines; processing, transporting, storage and
marketing of natural gas; and a gas-to-liquids plant. Downstream operations consist primarily of refining of crude oil into
petroleum products; marketing of crude oil, refined products and lubricants; transporting of crude oil and refined products by
pipeline, marine vessel, motor equipment and rail car; and manufacturing and marketing of commodity petrochemicals, plastics for
industrial uses, and fuel and lubricant additives. All Other activities of the company include worldwide cash management and debt
financing activities, corporate administrative functions, insurance operations, real estate activities, and technology activities.1

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts
The company’s segments are managed by “segment managers” who report to the “chief operating decision maker” (CODM). The
segments represent components of the company that engage in activities (a) from which revenues are earned and expenses are
incurred; (b) whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the CODM, which makes decisions about resources to be allocated
to the segments and assesses their performance; and (c) for which discrete financial information is available.
The company’s primary country of operation is the United States of America, its country of domicile. Other components of the
company’s operations are reported as “International” (outside the United States).
Segment Earnings The company evaluates the performance of its operating segments on an after-tax basis, without considering the
effects of debt financing interest expense or investment interest income, both of which are managed by the company on a
worldwide basis. Corporate administrative costs are not allocated to the operating segments. However, operating segments are
billed for the direct use of corporate services. Non billable costs remain at the corporate level in “All Other.” Earnings by major
operating area are presented in the following table:

Revenues for the upstream segment are derived primarily from the production and sale of crude oil and natural gas, as well as the
sale of third-party production of natural gas. Revenues for the downstream segment are derived from the refining and marketing of
petroleum products such as gasoline, jet fuel, gas oils, lubricants, residual fuel oils and other products derived from crude oil. This
segment also generates revenues from the manufacture and sale of fuel and lubricant additives and the transportation and trading of
refined products and crude oil. “All Other” activities include revenues from insurance operations, real estate activities and
technology companies.

Descriptions of major affiliates and non-equity investments, including significant differences between the company’s carrying value
of its investments and its underlying equity in the net assets of the affiliates, are as follows:
Tengizchevroil Chevron has a 50 percent equity ownership interest in Tengizchevroil (TCO), which operates the Tengiz and
Korolev crude oil fields in Kazakhstan. At December 31, 2020, the company’s carrying value of its investment in TCO was about
$100 higher than the amount of underlying equity in TCO’s net assets. This difference results from Chevron acquiring a portion of
its interest in TCO at a value greater than the underlying book value for that portion of TCO’s net assets. Included in the investment
is a loan to TCO to fund the development of the Future Growth and Wellhead Pressure Management Project with a balance of
$4,825.
Petropiar Chevron has a 30 percent interest in Petropiar, a joint stock company which operates the heavy oil Huyapari Field and
upgrading project in Venezuela’s Orinoco Belt. In 2020, the company fully impaired its investments in the Petropiar affiliate and,
effective July 1, 2020, began accounting for this venture as a non-equity method investment. At December 31, 2020, the underlying
equity in Petropiar’s net assets was approximately $1,500.
Petroboscan Chevron has a 39.2 percent interest in Petroboscan, a joint stock company which operates the Boscan Field in
Venezuela. In 2020, the company fully impaired its investments in the Petroboscan affiliate and, effective July 1, 2020, began
accounting for this venture as a non-equity method investment. At December 31, 2020, the underlying equity in Petroboscan’s net
assets was approximately $1,100. The company also has an outstanding long-term loan to Petroboscan of $560 at year-end 2020.
Caspian Pipeline Consortium Chevron has a 15 percent interest in the Caspian Pipeline Consortium, which provides the critical
export route for crude oil from both TCO and Karachaganak.
Angola LNG Limited Chevron has a 36.4 percent interest in Angola LNG Limited, which processes and liquefies natural gas
produced in Angola for delivery to international markets.
Noble Midstream Equity Affiliates Noble Midstream, a fully consolidated subsidiary of Chevron, has equity investments in entities
which operate midstream assets in the United States. At December 31, 2020, equity investments included

Litigation
MTBE Chevron and many other companies in the petroleum industry have used methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) as a gasoline
additive. Chevron is a party to six pending lawsuits and claims, the majority of which involve numerous other petroleum marketers
and refiners. Resolution of these lawsuits and claims may ultimately require the company to correct or ameliorate the alleged
effects on the environment of prior release of MTBE by the company or other parties. The company’s ultimate exposure related to
pending lawsuits and claims is not determinable. The company no longer uses MTBE in the manufacture of gasoline in the United
States.
Ecuador
Texaco Petroleum Company (Texpet), a subsidiary of Texaco Inc., was a minority member of an oil production consortium with
Ecuadorian state-owned Petroecuador from 1967 until 1992. After termination of the consortium and a third-party environmental
audit, Ecuador and the consortium parties entered into a settlement agreement specifying Texpet’s remediation obligations.
Following Texpet’s completion of a three-year remediation program, Ecuador certified the remediation as proper and released
Texpet and its affiliates from environmental liability. In May 2003, plaintiffs alleging environmental harm from the consortium’s
activities sued Chevron in the Superior Court in Lago Agrio, Ecuador. In February 2011, that court entered a judgment against
Chevron for approximately $9,500 plus additional punitive damages. An appellate panel affirmed, and Ecuador’s National Court of
Justice ratified the judgment but nullified the punitive damages, resulting in a judgment of approximately $9,500. Ecuador’s highest
Constitutional Court rejected Chevron’s final appeal in July 2018.
In February 2011, Chevron sued the Lago Agrio plaintiffs and several of their lawyers and supporters in the U.S. District Court for
the Southern District of New York (SDNY) for violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act and
state law. The SDNY court ruled that the Ecuadorian judgment had been procured through fraud, bribery, and corruption, and
prohibited the RICO defendants from seeking to enforce the Ecuadorian judgment in the United States or profiting from their
illegal acts. The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed, and the U.S. Supreme Court denied certiorari in June 2017,
rendering final the U.S. judgment in favor of Chevron. The Lago Agrio plaintiffs sought to
78

have the Ecuadorian judgment recognized and enforced in Canada, Brazil, and Argentina. All of those recognition and enforcement
actions were dismissed and resolved in Chevron’s favor. Chevron and Texpet filed an arbitration claim against Ecuador in
September 2009 before an arbitral tribunal administered by the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague, under the United
States-Ecuador Bilateral Investment Treaty. In August 2018, the Tribunal issued an award holding that the Ecuadorian judgment
was based on environmental claims that Ecuador had settled and released, and that it was procured through fraud, bribery, and
corruption. According to the Tribunal, the Ecuadorian judgment “violates international public policy” and “should not be
recognized or enforced by the courts of other States.” The Tribunal ordered Ecuador to remove the status of enforceability from the
Ecuadorian judgment and to compensate Chevron for any injuries resulting from the judgment. The third and final phase of the
arbitration, to determine the amount of compensation Ecuador owes to Chevron, is ongoing. In September 2020, the District Court
of The Hague denied Ecuador’s request to set aside the Tribunal’s award, stating that it now is “common ground” between Ecuador
and Chevron that the Ecuadorian judgment is fraudulent. In December 2020, Ecuador appealed the District Court’s decision to The
Hague Court of Appeals. In a separate proceeding, Ecuador also admitted that the Ecuadorian judgment is fraudulent in a public
filing with the Office of the United States Trade Representative in July 2020.
Management’s Assessment The ultimate outcome of the foregoing matters, including any financial effect on Chevron, remains
uncertain. Chevron continues to believe that the Ecuadorian judgment is illegitimate and unenforceable and that it does not provide
any basis upon which an estimate of a reasonably possible loss or range of loss can be made.

charges. The company’s effective tax rate changed from 49 percent in 2019 to 25 percent in 2020. The change in effective tax rate
is a consequence of mix effect resulting from the absolute level of earnings or losses and whether they arose in higher or lower tax
rate jurisdictions.
The company records its deferred taxes on a tax-jurisdiction basis. The reported deferred tax balances are composed of the
following:
At December 31

Deferred tax assets valuation allowance 17,762 15,965 
Total deferred taxes, net $ 7,283 $ 9,510 
Deferred tax liabilities decreased by $403 from year-end 2019. The decrease to Properties, plant and equipment temporary
differences was partially offset with an increase to Investments and other. The Properties, plant and equipment decrease was
primarily due to upstream impairments. Deferred tax assets increased by $3,621 from year-end 2019. This increase was primarily
related to increases in tax loss carryforwards for various locations, miscellaneous items related to foreign exchange and foreign tax
credits acquired with the purchase of Noble.
The overall valuation allowance relates to deferred tax assets for U.S. foreign tax credit carryforwards, tax loss carryforwards and
temporary differences. The valuation allowance reduces the deferred tax assets to amounts that are, in management’s assessment,
more likely than not to be realized. At the end of 2020, the company had gross tax loss carryforwards of approximately $19,763
and tax credit carryforwards of approximately $1,056, primarily related to various international tax jurisdictions. Whereas some of
these tax loss carryforwards do not have an expiration date, others expire at various times from 2021 through 2034. U.S. foreign tax
credit carryforwards of $10,585 will expire between 2021 and 2030.
At December 31, 2020 and 2019, deferred taxes were classified on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as follows:
At December 31
2020 2019
Deferred charges and other assets $ (5,286) $ (4,178)
Noncurrent deferred income taxes 12,569 13,688 
Total deferred income taxes, net $ 7,283 $ 9,510 
Income taxes are not accrued for unremitted earnings of international operations that have been or are intended to be reinvested
indefinitely. The indefinite reinvestment assertion continues to apply for the purpose of determining deferred tax liabilities for U.S.
state and foreign withholding tax purposes.
U.S. state and foreign withholding taxes are not accrued for unremitted earnings of international operations that have been or are
intended to be reinvested indefinitely. Undistributed earnings of international consolidated subsidiaries and affiliates for which no
deferred income tax provision has been made for possible future remittances totaled approximately $52,100 at December 31, 2020.
This amount represents earnings reinvested as part of the company’s ongoing international business. It is not practicable to estimate
the amount of state and foreign taxes that might be payable on the possible remittance of earnings that are intended to be reinvested
indefinitely. The company does not anticipate incurring significant additional taxes on remittances of earnings that are not

Uncertain Income Tax Positions The company recognizes a tax benefit in the financial statements for an uncertain tax position
only if management’s assessment is that the position is “more likely than not” (i.e., a likelihood greater than 50 percent) to be
allowed by the tax jurisdiction based solely on the technical merits of the position. The term “tax position” in the accounting
standards for income taxes refers to a position in a previously filed tax return or a position expected to be taken in a future tax
return that is reflected in measuring current or deferred income tax assets and liabilities for interim or annual periods.
The following table indicates the changes to the company’s unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019
and 2018. The term “unrecognized tax benefits” in the accounting standards for income taxes refers to the differences between a tax
position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and the benefit measured and recognized in the financial statements. Interest
and penalties are not included.

Balance at December 31 $ 5,018 $ 4,987 $ 5,070 
Approximately 83 percent of the $5,018 of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2020, would have an impact on the effective
tax rate if subsequently recognized. Certain of these unrecognized tax benefits relate to tax carryforwards that may require a full
valuation allowance at the time of any such recognition.
Tax positions for Chevron and its subsidiaries and affiliates are subject to income tax audits by many tax jurisdictions throughout
the world. For the company’s major tax jurisdictions, examinations of tax returns for certain prior tax years had not been completed
as of December 31, 2020. For these jurisdictions, the latest years for which income tax examinations had been finalized were as
follows: United States – 2013, Nigeria – 2007, Australia – 2009 and Kazakhstan – 2012.
The company engages in ongoing discussions with tax authorities regarding the resolution of tax matters in the various
jurisdictions. Both the outcome of these tax matters and the timing of resolution and/or closure of the tax audits are highly
uncertain. However, it is reasonably possible that developments on tax matters in certain tax jurisdictions may result in significant
increases or decreases in the company’s total unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months. Given the number of years that
still remain subject to examination and the number of matters being examined in the various tax jurisdictions, the company is
unable to estimate the range of possible adjustments to the balance of unrecognized tax benefits.
On the Consolidated Statement of Income, the company reports interest and penalties related to liabilities for uncertain tax
positions as “Income tax expense.” As of December 31, 2020, accrual benefit of $(95) for anticipated interest and penalty were
included on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, compared with accrual charges of $30 as of year-end 2019. Income tax expense
(benefit) associated with interest and penalties was $(124), $(3) and $8 in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

Weighted-average interest rates at December 31, 2020 and 2019, were 0.15% and 1.69%, respectively.
Redeemable long-term obligations consist primarily of tax-exempt variable-rate put bonds that are included as current liabilities
because they become redeemable at the option of the bondholders during the year following the balance sheet date.
The company may periodically enter into interest rate swaps on a portion of its short-term debt. At December 31, 2020, the
company had no interest rate swaps on short-term debt.
At December 31, 2020, the company had $9,825 in 364-day committed credit facilities with various major banks that enable the
refinancing of short-term obligations on a long-term basis. The credit facilities allow the company to convert any amounts
outstanding into a term loan for a period of up to one year. This supports commercial paper borrowing and can also be used for
general corporate purposes. The company’s practice has been to continually replace expiring commitments with new commitments
on substantially the same terms, maintaining levels management believes appropriate. Any borrowings under the facility would be
unsecured indebtedness at interest rates based on the London Interbank Offered Rate or an average of base lending rates published
by specified banks and on terms reflecting the company’s strong credit rating. No borrowings were outstanding under this facility at
December 31, 2020.
The company classified $9,825 and $9,750 of short-term debt as long-term at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Settlement of these obligations is not expected to require the use of working capital within one year, and the company has both the
intent and the ability, as evidenced by committed credit facilities, to refinance them on a long-term basis.1

Chevron has an automatic shelf registration statement that expires in August 2023. This registration statement is for an unspecified
amount of nonconvertible debt securities issued or guaranteed by Chevron Corporation or CUSA.
Long-term debt excluding finance lease liabilities with a principal balance of $33,507 matures as follows: 2021 – $2,600; 2022 –

The company completed bond issuances of $8,000 and $4,000 in May and August 2020, respectively. Chevron also assumed total
debt, including finance lease obligations, with a fair value of approximately $9,400, associated with the acquisition of Noble on
October 5, 2020.
Included in the debt assumed from Noble were senior notes, with an aggregate principal amount of $5,800, with interest rates
ranging from 3.250 percent to 8.000 percent and maturity dates ranging from 2023 to 2049. On January 6, 2021, Chevron
announced that the aggregate principal amount of $5,697 of prior Noble senior notes were exchanged for new1 2

senior notes issued by CUSA, guaranteed by Chevron, and having the same interest rates and maturity dates as the Noble senior
notes. The aggregate principal amount of $5,697 prior Noble notes were validly tendered and accepted and subsequently
terminated. Following such termination, $103 aggregate principal amount remains outstanding across ten series of senior notes
issued by Noble, for which Chevron provided no guarantee, and the indentures were modified to eliminate any financial reporting
or credit rating requirements. In February 2021, the indenture governing Noble’s 7.250 percent senior debentures due 2097 was
modified to provide a guarantee by Chevron and eliminate any financial reporting or credit rating requirements.

Note 19
Accounting for Suspended Exploratory Wells
The company continues to capitalize exploratory well costs after the completion of drilling when the well has found a sufficient
quantity of reserves to justify completion as a producing well, and the business unit is making sufficient progress assessing the
reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project. If either condition is not met or if the company obtains information
that raises substantial doubt about the economic or operational viability of the project, the exploratory well would be assumed to be
impaired, and its costs, net of any salvage value, would be charged to expense.
The following table indicates the changes to the company’s suspended exploratory well costs for the three years ended
December 31, 2020:
2020 2019 2018
Beginning balance at January 1 $ 3,041 $ 3,563 $ 3,702

Ending balance at December 31 $ 2,512 $ 3,041 $ 3,563 
 2020 represents fair value of well costs acquired in the Noble acquisition. 2019 represents property sales.
The following table provides an aging of capitalized well costs and the number of projects for which exploratory well costs have
been capitalized for a period greater than one year since the completion of drilling. The aging of the former Noble wells is based on
the date the drilling was completed, rather than Chevron’s October 2020 acquisition of Noble.

Number of projects with exploratory well costs that have been capitalized for a period greater than one year 17 22 30 
Certain projects have multiple wells or fields or both.
Of the $2,486 of exploratory well costs capitalized for more than one year at December 31, 2020, $1,197 is related to 7 projects that
had drilling activities underway or firmly planned for the near future. The $1,289 balance is related to 10 projects in areas requiring
a major capital expenditure before production could begin and for which additional drilling efforts were not underway or firmly
planned for the near future. Additional drilling was not deemed necessary because the presence of hydrocarbons had already been
established, and other activities were in process to enable a future decision on project development.
The projects for the $1,289 referenced above had the following activities associated with assessing the reserves and the projects’
economic viability: (a) $826 (seven projects) – undergoing front-end engineering and design with final investment decision
expected within four years; (b) $463 (three projects) – development alternatives under review. While progress was being made on
all 17 projects, the decision on the recognition of proved reserves under SEC rules in some cases may not occur for several years
because of the complexity, scale and negotiations associated with the projects. More than half of these decisions are expected to
occur in the next five years.*

Stock Options and Other Share-Based Compensation
Compensation expense for stock options for 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $94 ($74 after tax), $81 ($64 after tax) and $105 ($83 after
tax), respectively. In addition, compensation expense for stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, performance shares and
restricted stock units was $96 ($76 after tax), $313 ($266 after tax) and $60 ($47 after tax) for 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
No significant stock-based compensation cost was capitalized at December 31, 2020, or December 31, 2019.
Cash received in payment for option exercises under all share-based payment arrangements for 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $226,
$1,090 and $1,159, respectively. Actual tax benefits realized for the tax deductions from option exercises were $8, $43 and $43 for
2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Cash paid to settle performance shares, restricted stock units and stock appreciation rights was $95, $119 and $157 for 2020, 2019
and 2018, respectively. Cash paid in 2020 included $11 million for Noble awards paid under change-in-control plan provisions.
Awards under the Chevron Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) may take the form of, but are not limited to, stock options, restricted
stock, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights, performance shares and nonstock grants. From April 2004 through May
2023, no more than 260 million shares may be issued under the LTIP. For awards issued on or after May 29, 2013, no more than 50
million of those shares may be in a form other than a stock option, stock appreciation right or award requiring full payment for
shares by the award recipient. For the major types of awards issued before January 1, 2017, the contractual terms vary between
three years for the performance shares and restricted stock units, and 10 years for the stock options and stock appreciation rights.
For awards issued after January 1, 2017, contractual terms vary between three years for the performance shares and special
restricted stock units, five years for standard restricted stock units and 10 years for the stock options and stock appreciation rights.
Forfeitures for performance shares, restricted stock units, and stock appreciation rights are recognized as they occur. Forfeitures for
stock options are estimated using historical forfeiture data dating back to 1990.
Noble Share-Based Plans (Noble Plans) On the closing of the acquisition of Noble in October 2020, outstanding stock options
granted under various Noble Plans were exchanged for fully vested Chevron options at a conversion rate of 0.1191 Chevron shares
for each Noble share. These awards retained the same provision as the original Noble Plans. Awards issued may be exercised for up
to 5 years after termination of employment, depending upon the termination type, or the original expiration date, whichever is
earlier. Other awards issued under the Noble Plans included restricted stock, phantom stock units, and performance shares that
retained the same provisions as the original Noble Plans. Upon termination of employment due to change-in-control, all unvested
awards issued under the Noble Plans, including stock options, restricted stock, phantom stock units and performance shares become
vested on the termination date.
Fair Value and Assumptions The fair market values of stock options and stock appreciation rights granted in 2020, 2019 and 2018
were measured on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, with the following weighted-average
assumptions:

The total intrinsic value (i.e., the difference between the exercise price and the market price) of options exercised during 2020,
2019 and 2018 was $92, $516 and $506, respectively. During this period, the company continued its practice of issuing treasury
shares upon exercise of these awards.
As of December 31, 2020, there was $57 of total unrecognized before-tax compensation cost related to nonvested share-based
compensation arrangements granted under the plan. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of
1.7 years.
At January 1, 2020, the number of LTIP performance shares outstanding was equivalent to 4,386,784 shares. During 2020,
2,064,598 performance shares were granted, 676,282 shares vested with cash proceeds distributed to recipients and 1,340,303
shares were forfeited. At December 31, 2020, performance shares outstanding were 4,434,797. The fair value of the liability
recorded for these instruments was $385, and was measured using the Monte Carlo simulation method.
At January 1, 2020, the number of restricted stock units outstanding was equivalent to 2,512,345 shares. During 2020, 1,253,337
restricted stock units were granted, 165,007 units vested with cash proceeds distributed to recipients and 296,742 units were
forfeited. At December 31, 2020, restricted stock units outstanding were 3,303,933. The fair value of the liability recorded for the
vested portion of these instruments was $197, valued at the stock price as of December 31, 2020. In addition, outstanding stock
appreciation rights that were granted under LTIP totaled approximately 4.1 million equivalent shares as of December 31, 2020. The
fair value of the liability recorded for the vested portion of these instruments was $34.

The company has defined benefit pension plans for many employees. The company typically prefunds defined benefit plans as
required by local regulations or in certain situations where prefunding provides economic advantages. In the United States, all
qualified plans are subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) minimum funding standard. The company
does not typically fund U.S. nonqualified pension plans that are not subject to funding requirements under laws and regulations
because contributions to these pension plans may be less economic and investment returns may be less attractive than the
company’s other investment alternatives.
The company also sponsors other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans that provide medical and dental benefits, as well as life
insurance for some active and qualifying retired employees. The plans are unfunded, and the company and retirees share the costs.
For the company’s main U.S. medical plan, the increase to the pre-Medicare company contribution for retiree medical coverage is
limited to no more than 4 percent each year. Certain life insurance benefits are paid by the company.
The company recognizes the overfunded or underfunded status of each of its defined benefit pension and OPEB plans as an asset or
liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.1

For the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the increase in benefit obligations was primarily due to actuarial
losses caused by lower discount rates used to value the obligations.
Amounts recognized on a before-tax basis in “Accumulated other comprehensive loss” for the company’s pension and OPEB plans
were $7,278 and $6,357 at the end of 2020 and 2019, respectively. These amounts consisted of:

Assumptions The following weighted-average assumptions were used to determine benefit obligations and net periodic benefit
costs for years ended December 31:
Pension Benefits
2020 2019 2018 Other Benefits
U.S. Int’l. U.S. Int’l. U.S. Int’l. 2020 2019 2018
Assumptions used to determine benefit obligations:
Discount rate 2.4 % 2.4 % 3.1 % 3.2 % 4.2 % 4.4 % 2.6 % 3.2 % 4.4 %
Rate of compensation increase 4.5 % 4.0 % 4.5 % 4.0 % 4.5 % 4.0 % N/A N/A N/A
Assumptions used to determine net periodic
benefit cost:
Discount rate for service cost 3.3 % 3.2 % 4.4 % 4.4 % 3.7 % 3.9 % 3.5 % 4.6 % 3.9 %
Discount rate for interest cost 2.6 % 3.2 % 3.7 % 4.4 % 3.0 % 3.9 % 3.0 % 4.2 % 3.5 %
Expected return on plan assets 6.5 % 4.5 % 6.8 % 5.6 % 6.8 % 5.5 % N/A N/A N/A
Rate of compensation increase 4.5 % 4.0 % 4.5 % 4.0 % 4.5 % 4.0 % N/A N/A N/A
Expected Return on Plan Assets The company’s estimated long-term rates of return on pension assets are driven primarily by
actual historical asset-class returns, an assessment of expected future performance, advice from external actuarial firms and the
incorporation of specific asset-class risk factors. Asset allocations are periodically updated using pension plan asset/liability
studies, and the company’s estimated long-term rates of return are consistent with these studies.
For 2020, the company used an expected long-term rate of return of 6.50 percent for U.S. pension plan assets, which account for 65
percent of the company’s pension plan assets. In both 2019 and 2018, the company used a long-term rate of return of 6.75 percent
for these plans.
The market-related value of assets of the main U.S. pension plan used in the determination of pension expense was based on the
market values in the three months preceding the year-end measurement date. Management considers the three-month time period
long enough to minimize the effects of distortions from day-to-day market volatility and still be contemporaneous to the end of the
year. For other plans, market value of assets as of year-end is used in calculating the pension expense.

Discount Rate The discount rate assumptions used to determine the U.S. and international pension and OPEB plan obligations and
expense reflect the rate at which benefits could be effectively settled, and are equal to the equivalent single rate resulting from yield
curve analysis. This analysis considered the projected benefit payments specific to the company’s plans and the yields on high-
quality bonds. The projected cash flows were discounted to the valuation date using the yield curve for the main U.S. pension and
OPEB plans. The effective discount rates derived from this analysis at the end of 2020 were 2.4 for the main U.S. pension plan and
2.4 for the main U.S. OPEB plan. The discount rates for these plans at the end of 2019 were 3.1 and 3.1 percent, respectively, while
in 2018 they were 4.2 and 4.3 percent for these plans, respectively.
Other Benefit Assumptions For the measurement of accumulated postretirement benefit obligation at December 31, 2020, for the
main U.S. OPEB plan, the assumed health care cost-trend rates start with 6.1 percent in 2021 and gradually decline to 4.5 percent
for 2027 and beyond. For this measurement at December 31, 2019, the assumed health care cost-trend rates started with 6.8 percent
in 2020 and gradually declined to 4.5 percent for 2025 and beyond.

The primary investment objectives of the pension plans are to achieve the highest rate of total return within prudent levels of risk
and liquidity, to diversify and mitigate potential downside risk associated with the investments, and to provide adequate liquidity
for benefit payments and portfolio management.
The company’s U.S. and U.K. pension plans comprise 91 percent of the total pension assets. Both the U.S. and U.K. plans have an
Investment Committee that regularly meets during the year to review the asset holdings and their returns. To assess the plans’
investment performance, long-term asset allocation policy benchmarks have been established.
For the primary U.S. pension plan, the company’s Investment Committee has established the following approved asset allocation
ranges: Equities 40–65 percent, Fixed Income 20–40 percent, Real Estate 0–15 percent, Alternative Investments 0–5 percent and
Cash 0–25 percent. For the U.K. pension plan, the U.K. Board of Trustees has established the following asset allocation guidelines:
Equities 10–30 percent, Fixed Income 55–85 percent, Real Estate 5–15 percent, and Cash 0–5 percent. The other significant
international pension plans also have established maximum and minimum asset allocation ranges that vary by plan. Actual asset
allocation within approved ranges is based on a variety of factors, including market conditions and illiquidity constraints. To
mitigate concentration and other risks, assets are invested across multiple asset classes with active investment managers and passive
index funds.
The company does not prefund its OPEB obligations.
Cash Contributions and Benefit Payments In 2020, the company contributed $950 and $263 to its U.S. and international pension
plans, respectively. In 2021, the company expects contributions to be approximately $1,050 to its U.S. plans and $200 to its
international pension plans. Actual contribution amounts are dependent upon investment returns, changes in pension obligations,
regulatory environments, tax law changes and other economic factors. Additional funding may ultimately be required if investment
returns are insufficient to offset increases in plan obligations.
The company anticipates paying OPEB benefits of approximately $153 in 2021; $155 was paid in 2020.
The following benefit payments, which include estimated future service, are expected to be paid by the company in the next
10 years:

2018, respectively.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts
Benefit Plan Trusts Prior to its acquisition by Chevron, Texaco established a benefit plan trust for funding obligations under some
of its benefit plans. At year-end 2020, the trust contained 14.2 million shares of Chevron treasury stock. The trust will sell the
shares or use the dividends from the shares to pay benefits only to the extent that the company does not pay such benefits. The
company intends to continue to pay its obligations under the benefit plans. The trustee will vote the shares held in the trust as
instructed by the trust’s beneficiaries. The shares held in the trust are not considered outstanding for earnings-per-share purposes
until distributed or sold by the trust in payment of benefit obligations.
Prior to its acquisition by Chevron, Unocal established various grantor trusts to fund obligations under some of its benefit plans,
including the deferred compensation and supplemental retirement plans. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, trust assets of $36 and
$35, respectively, were invested primarily in interest-earning accounts.
Employee Incentive Plans The Chevron Incentive Plan is an annual cash bonus plan for eligible employees that links awards to
corporate, business unit and individual performance in the prior year. Charges to expense for cash bonuses were $462, $826 and
$1,048 in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Chevron also has the LTIP for officers and other regular salaried employees of the
company and its subsidiaries who hold positions of significant responsibility. Awards under the LTIP consist of stock options and
other share-based compensation that are described in Note 20, beginning on page 86.
Note 22
Other Contingencies and Commitments
Income Taxes The company calculates its income tax expense and liabilities quarterly. These liabilities generally are subject to
audit and are not finalized with the individual taxing authorities until several years after the end of the annual period for which
income taxes have been calculated. Refer to Note 15, beginning on page 79, for a discussion of the periods for which tax returns
have been audited for the company’s major tax jurisdictions and a discussion for all tax jurisdictions of the differences between the
amount of tax benefits recognized in the financial statements and the amount taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.
Settlement of open tax years, as well as other tax issues in countries where the company conducts its businesses, are not expected to
have a material effect on the consolidated financial position or liquidity of the company and, in the opinion of management,
adequate provisions have been made for all years under examination or subject to future examination.
Guarantees The company has two guarantees to equity affiliates totaling $391. Of this amount, $137 is associated with a financing
arrangement with an equity affiliate. Over the approximate 1-year remaining term of this guarantee, the maximum amount will be
reduced as payments are made by the affiliate. The remaining amount of $254 is associated with certain payments under a terminal
use agreement entered into by an equity affiliate. Over the approximate 7-year remaining term of this guarantee, the maximum
guarantee amount will be reduced as certain fees are paid by the affiliate. There are numerous cross-indemnity agreements with the
affiliate and the other partners to permit recovery of amounts paid under the guarantee. Chevron has recorded no liability for either
guarantee.
Indemnifications In the acquisition of Unocal, the company assumed certain indemnities relating to contingent environmental
liabilities associated with assets that were sold in 1997. The acquirer of those assets shared in certain environmental remediation
costs up to a maximum obligation of $200, which had been reached at December 31, 2009. Under the indemnification agreement,
after reaching the $200 obligation, Chevron is solely responsible until April 2022, when the indemnification expires. The
environmental conditions or events that are subject to these indemnities must have arisen prior to the sale of the assets in 1997.
Although the company has provided for known obligations under this indemnity that are probable and reasonably estimable, the
amount of additional future costs may be material to results of operations in the period in which they are recognized. The company
does not expect these costs will have a material effect on its consolidated financial position or liquidity.
Long-Term Unconditional Purchase Obligations and Commitments, Including Throughput and Take-or-Pay Agreements The
company and its subsidiaries have certain contingent liabilities with respect to long-term unconditional purchase obligations and
commitments, including throughput and take-or-pay agreements, some of which may relate to suppliers’ financing arrangements.
The agreements typically provide goods and services, such as pipeline and storage capacity, utilities, and petroleum products, to be
used or sold in the ordinary course of the company’s business. The aggregate approximate amounts of required payments under
these various commitments are: 2021 – $1,000; 2022 – $1,200; 2023 – $1,300; 2024 – $1,300; 2025 – $1,400; 2026 and after –
$8,400. A portion of these commitments may
92
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts
ultimately be shared with project partners. Total payments under the agreements were approximately $500 in 2020, $800 in 2019
and $1,400 in 2018.
Environmental The company is subject to loss contingencies pursuant to laws, regulations, private claims and legal proceedings
related to environmental matters that are subject to legal settlements or that in the future may require the company to take action to
correct or ameliorate the effects on the environment of prior release of chemicals or petroleum substances, including MTBE, by the
company or other parties. Such contingencies may exist for various operating, closed and divested sites, including, but not limited
to, federal Superfund sites and analogous sites under state laws, refineries, chemical plants, marketing facilities, crude oil fields,
and mining sites.
Although the company has provided for known environmental obligations that are probable and reasonably estimable, it is likely
that the company will continue to incur additional liabilities. The amount of additional future costs are not fully determinable due to
such factors as the unknown magnitude of possible contamination, the unknown timing and extent of the corrective actions that
may be required, the determination of the company’s liability in proportion to other responsible parties, and the extent to which
such costs are recoverable from third parties. These future costs may be material to results of operations in the period in which they
are recognized, but the company does not expect these costs will have a material effect on its consolidated financial position or
liquidity.
Chevron’s environmental reserve as of December 31, 2020, was $1,139. Included in this balance was $247 related to remediation
activities at approximately 145 sites for which the company had been identified as a potentially responsible party under the
provisions of the federal Superfund law or analogous state laws which provide for joint and several liability for all responsible
parties. Any future actions by regulatory agencies to require Chevron to assume other potentially responsible parties’ costs at
designated hazardous waste sites are not expected to have a material effect on the company’s results of operations, consolidated
financial position or liquidity.
Of the remaining year-end 2020 environmental reserves balance of $892, $611 is related to the company’s U.S. downstream
operations, $47 to its international downstream operations, $233 to upstream operations and $1 to other businesses. Liabilities at all
sites were primarily associated with the company’s plans and activities to remediate soil or groundwater contamination or both.
The company manages environmental liabilities under specific sets of regulatory requirements, which in the United States include
the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and various state and local regulations. No single remediation site at year-end 2020
had a recorded liability that was material to the company’s results of operations, consolidated financial position or liquidity.
Refer to Note 23 on page 94 for a discussion of the company’s asset retirement obligations.
Other Contingencies Governmental and other entities in California and other jurisdictions have filed legal proceedings against
fossil fuel producing companies, including Chevron, purporting to seek legal and equitable relief to address alleged impacts of
climate change. Further such proceedings are likely to be filed by other parties. The unprecedented legal theories set forth in these
proceedings entail the possibility of damages liability and injunctions against the production of all fossil fuels that, while we
believe remote, could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations and financial condition. Management
believes that these proceedings are legally and factually meritless and detract from constructive efforts to address the important
policy issues presented by climate change, and will vigorously defend against such proceedings.
Seven coastal parishes and the State of Louisiana have filed 43 separate lawsuits in Louisiana against numerous oil and gas
companies seeking damages for coastal erosion in or near oil fields located within Louisiana’s coastal zone under Louisiana’s State
and Local Coastal Resources Management Act (SLCRMA). Chevron entities are defendants in 39 of these cases. The lawsuits
allege that the defendants’ historical operations were conducted without necessary permits or failed to comply with permits
obtained and seek damages and other relief, including the costs of restoring coastal wetlands allegedly impacted by oil field
operations. Plaintiffs’ SLCRMA theories are unprecedented; thus, there remains significant uncertainty about the scope of the
claims and alleged damages and any potential effects on the company’s results of operations and financial condition. Management
believes that the claims lack legal and factual merit and will continue to vigorously defend against such proceedings.
Chevron receives claims from and submits claims to customers; trading partners; joint venture partners; U.S. federal, state and local
regulatory bodies; governments; contractors; insurers; suppliers; and individuals. The amounts of these claims,

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts
individually and in the aggregate, may be significant and take lengthy periods to resolve, and may result in gains or losses in future
periods.
The company and its affiliates also continue to review and analyze their operations and may close, retire, sell, exchange, acquire or
restructure assets to achieve operational or strategic benefits and to improve competitiveness and profitability. These activities,
individually or together, may result in significant gains or losses in future periods.
Note 23
Asset Retirement Obligations
The company records the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation (ARO) both as an asset and a liability when there
is a legal obligation associated with the retirement of a tangible long-lived asset and the liability can be reasonably estimated. The
legal obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is unconditional, even though uncertainty may exist about the timing and/or
method of settlement that may be beyond the company’s control. This uncertainty about the timing and/or method of settlement is
factored into the measurement of the liability when sufficient information exists to reasonably estimate fair value. Recognition of
the ARO includes: (1) the present value of a liability and offsetting asset, (2) the subsequent accretion of that liability and
depreciation of the asset, and (3) the periodic review of the ARO liability estimates and discount rates.
AROs are primarily recorded for the company’s crude oil and natural gas producing assets. No significant AROs associated with
any legal obligations to retire downstream long-lived assets have been recognized, as indeterminate settlement dates for the asset
retirements prevent estimation of the fair value of the associated ARO. The company performs periodic reviews of its downstream
long-lived assets for any changes in facts and circumstances that might require recognition of a retirement obligation.
The following table indicates the changes to the company’s before-tax asset retirement obligations in 2020, 2019 and 2018:
2020 2019 2018
Balance at January 1 $ 12,832 $ 14,050 $ 14,214

Revisions in estimated cash flows 1,245 (184) (84)
Balance at December 31 $ 13,616 $ 12,832 $ 14,050 
In the table above, the amount associated with “Revisions in estimated cash flows” in 2020 reflects increased cost estimates to
decommission wells, equipment and facilities. The long-term portion of the $13,616 balance at the end of 2020 was $11,877.
Note 24
Revenue
Revenue from contracts with customers is presented in “Sales and other operating revenue” along with some activity that is
accounted for outside the scope of Accounting Standard Codification (ASC) 606, which is not material to this line, on the
Consolidated Statement of Income. Purchases and sales of inventory with the same counterparty that are entered into in
contemplation of one another (including buy/sell arrangements) are combined and recorded on a net basis and reported in
“Purchased crude oil and products” on the Consolidated Statement of Income. Refer to Note 12 beginning on page 74 for additional
information on the company’s segmentation of revenue.
Receivables related to revenue from contracts with customers are included in “Accounts and notes receivable, net” on the
Consolidated Balance Sheet, net of the allowance for doubtful accounts. The net balance of these receivables was $7,631 and
$9,247 at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. Other items included in “Accounts and notes receivable, net”
represent amounts due from partners for their share of joint venture operating and project costs and amounts due from others,
primarily related to derivatives, leases, buy/sell arrangements and product exchanges, which are accounted for outside the scope of
ASC 606.
Contract assets and related costs are reflected in “Prepaid expenses and other current assets” and contract liabilities are reflected in
“Accrued liabilities” and “Deferred credits and other noncurrent obligations” on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Amounts for
these items are not material to the company’s financial position.

Financial Instruments - Credit Losses
Chevron adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses, and its related amendments
at the effective date of January 1, 2020. The standard replaces the “incurred loss model” and requires an estimate of expected credit
losses, measured over the contractual life of a financial instrument, that considers forecast of future economic conditions in addition
to information about past events and current conditions. The cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening retained earnings at
January 1, 2020 was a reduction of $25, representing a decrease to the net accounts and notes receivable balances shown on the
company’s consolidated balance sheet on page 61. Chevron’s expected credit loss allowance balance was $671 as of December 31,
2020 and $849 as of December 31, 2019, with a majority of the allowance relating to non-trade receivable balances. A reduction in
the allowance for non-trade receivables of $550 was recorded in the second quarter as an agreement was reached with a
government joint venture partner that resulted in the write-off of the associated receivable balances. Additionally, new allowances
of $265 were recorded in the second and third quarters associated with other than trade receivables.
The majority of the company’s receivable balance is concentrated in trade receivables, with a balance of $9.5 billion as of
December 31, 2020, which reflects the company’s diversified sources of revenues and is dispersed across the company’s broad
worldwide customer base. As a result, the company believes the concentration of credit risk is limited. The company routinely
assesses the financial strength of its customers. When the financial strength of a customer is not considered sufficient, alternative
risk mitigation measures may be deployed, including requiring pre-payments, letters of credit or other acceptable forms of
collateral. Once credit is extended and a receivable balance exists, the company applies a quantitative calculation to current trade
receivable balances that reflects credit risk predictive analysis, including probability of default and loss given default, which takes
into consideration current and forward-looking market data as well as the company’s historical loss data. This statistical approach
becomes the basis of the company’s expected credit loss allowance for current trade receivables with payment terms that are
typically short-term in nature, with most due in less than 90 days. The company continues to monitor credit risk in response to the
COVID-19 pandemic and the significant reduction in crude prices resulting from decreased demand associated with government-
mandated travel restrictions.
Chevron's non-trade receivable balance was $3.3 billion as of December 31, 2020, which includes receivables from certain
governments in their capacity as joint venture partners. Joint venture partner balances that are paid as per contract terms or not yet
due are subject to the statistical analysis described above while past due balances are subject to additional qualitative management
quarterly review. This management review includes review of reasonable and supportable repayment forecasts. Non-trade
receivables also include employee and tax receivables that are deemed immaterial and low risk.
Equity affiliate loans are also considered non-trade and during the second quarter 2020 review, a $560 allowance was recognized
within “Investments and advances” on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Acquisition of Noble Energy, Inc.
On October 5, 2020, the company acquired Noble Energy, Inc., an independent oil and gas exploration and production company.
Noble’s principal upstream operations are in the United States, the Eastern Mediterranean and West Africa. Noble’s operations also
include an integrated midstream business in the United States. The acquisition of Noble provides the company with low-cost
proved reserves, attractive undeveloped resources and cash-generating assets.
The aggregate purchase price of Noble was $4,109, with approximately 58 million shares of Chevron common stock issued as
consideration in the transaction, representing approximately 3 percent of shares of Chevron common stock outstanding
96
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts
immediately after the acquisition. As part of the transaction, the company recognized long-term debt and finance leases with a fair
value of $9,231.
The acquisition was accounted for as a business combination under ASC 805, which requires assets acquired and liabilities
assumed to be measured at their acquisition date fair values. Provisional fair value measurements were made for acquired assets
and liabilities, and adjustments to those measurements may be made in subsequent periods, up to one year from the acquisition
date, as information necessary to complete the analysis is obtained. Oil and gas properties were valued using a discounted cash flow
approach that incorporated internally generated price assumptions and production profiles together with appropriate operating cost
and development cost assumptions. Debt assumed in the acquisition was valued based on observable market prices for Noble’s
debt. As a result of measuring the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at fair value, there was no goodwill or bargain
purchase recognized.
The following table summarizes the values assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed:
At October 5, 2020
Current assets $ 1,105 
Investments and long-term receivables 1,282 
Properties (includes $14,935 for oil and gas properties) 16,703 
Other assets 607 
Total assets acquired 19,697 
Current liabilities 1,829 
Long-term debt and finance leases 9,231 
Deferred income taxes 2,355 
Other liabilities 1,394 
Total liabilities assumed 14,809 
Noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest 779 
Net assets acquired $ 4,109 
The following unaudited pro forma summary presents the results of operations as if the acquisition of Noble had occurred January
1, 2019:
Year ended December 31
2020 2019
Sales and other operating revenues $ 96,980 $ 144,303 
Net income $ (9,890)$ 1,412 
The pro forma summary uses estimates and assumptions based on information available at the time. Management believes the
estimates and assumptions to be reasonable; however, actual results may differ significantly from this pro forma financial
information. The pro forma information does not reflect any synergistic savings that might be achieved from combining the
operations and is not intended to reflect the actual results that would have occurred had the companies actually been combined
during the periods presented.

Reserves Governance The company has adopted a comprehensive reserves and resource classification system modeled after a
system developed and approved by a number of organizations including the Society of Petroleum Engineers, the World Petroleum
Congress and the American Association of Petroleum Geologists. The company classifies recoverable hydrocarbons into six
categories based on their status at the time of reporting – three deemed commercial and three potentially recoverable. Within the
commercial classification are proved reserves and two categories of unproved reserves: probable and possible. The potentially
recoverable categories are also referred to as contingent resources. For reserves estimates to be classified as proved, they must meet
all SEC and company standards.
Proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities that geoscience and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty
to be economically producible in the future from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions, operating methods and
government regulations. Net proved reserves exclude royalties and interests owned by others and reflect contractual arrangements
and royalty obligations in effect at the time of the estimate.
Proved reserves are classified as either developed or undeveloped. Proved developed reserves are the quantities expected to be
recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods. Proved undeveloped reserves are the quantities
expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is
required for recompletion.
Due to the inherent uncertainties and the limited nature of reservoir data, estimates of reserves are subject to change as additional
information becomes available.
Proved reserves are estimated by company asset teams composed of earth scientists and engineers. As part of the internal control
process related to reserves estimation, the company maintains a Reserves Advisory Committee (RAC) that is chaired by the
Manager of Global Reserves, an organization that is separate from the Upstream operating organization. The
103
Supplemental Information on Oil and Gas Producing Activities - Unaudited
Manager of Global Reserves has more than 30 years’ experience working in the oil and gas industry and holds both undergraduate
and graduate degrees in geoscience. His experience includes various technical and management roles in providing reserve and
resource estimates in support of major capital and exploration projects, and more than 10 years of overseeing oil and gas reserves
processes. He has been named a Distinguished Lecturer by the American Association of Petroleum Geologists and is an active
member of the American Association of Petroleum Geologists, the SEPM Society of Sedimentary Geologists and the Society of
Petroleum Engineers.
All RAC members are degreed professionals, each with more than 10 years of experience in various aspects of reserves estimation
relating to reservoir engineering, petroleum engineering, earth science or finance. The members are knowledgeable in SEC
guidelines for proved reserves classification and receive annual training on the preparation of reserves estimates.
The RAC has the following primary responsibilities: establish the policies and processes used within the operating units to estimate
reserves; provide independent reviews and oversight of the business units’ recommended reserves estimates and changes; confirm
that proved reserves are recognized in accordance with SEC guidelines; determine that reserve volumes are calculated using
consistent and appropriate standards, procedures and technology; and maintain the Chevron Corporation Reserves Manual, which
provides standardized procedures used corporatewide for classifying and reporting hydrocarbon reserves.
During the year, the RAC is represented in meetings with each of the company’s upstream business units to review and discuss
reserve changes recommended by the various asset teams. Major changes are also reviewed with the company’s senior leadership
team including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer. The company’s annual reserve activity is also reviewed
with the Board of Directors. If major changes to reserves were to occur between the annual reviews, those matters would also be
discussed with the Board.
RAC subteams also conduct in-depth reviews during the year of many of the fields that have large proved reserves quantities.
These reviews include an examination of the proved-reserve records and documentation of their compliance with the Chevron
Corporation Reserves Manual.
The acquisition of Noble was completed on October 5, 2020. Given the timing of the acquisition, Chevron has continued to rely on
legacy Noble reserves staff and processes for reviewing reserves with input and guidance from the Chevron Reserves Advisory
Committee. The processes include internal reviews and an external audit. Accordingly, Chevron continued to retain Netherland,
Sewell & Associates, Inc. (NSAI), a third-party petroleum consulting firm, that completed an audit of the legacy Noble acquisition
proved reserves at December 31, 2020 (representing approximately 15% of Chevron’s total reserves). Based upon their evaluation
NSAI issued an unqualified audit opinion, and this report is attached as Exhibit 99.3 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Technologies Used in Establishing Proved Reserves Additions In 2020, additions to Chevron’s proved reserves were based on a
wide range of geologic and engineering technologies. Information generated from wells, such as well logs, wire line sampling,
production and pressure testing, fluid analysis, and core analysis, was integrated with seismic data, regional geologic studies, and
information from analogous reservoirs to provide “reasonably certain” proved reserves estimates. Both proprietary and
commercially available analytic tools, including reservoir simulation, geologic modeling and seismic processing, have been used in
the interpretation of the subsurface data. These technologies have been utilized extensively by the company in the past, and the
company believes that they provide a high degree of confidence in establishing reliable and consistent reserves estimates.

In 2020, Revisions include a reduction of 392 million BOE in the United States, primarily from the Midland and Delaware basins
where 300 million BOE was attributed to demotions due to capital reductions, commodity price effects and performance revisions,
and 75 million BOE from the Gulf of Mexico, primarily from commodity price effects at Anchor. In Australia, there was a net
reduction of 269 million BOE, primarily from demotion of compression volumes related to capital and approval delays at Jansz Io,
partially offset by positive revisions at Gorgon (Gorgon and Jansz Io make up the Gorgon Project). A reduction of 85 million BOE
was recorded in Canada, primarily from commodity price effects at Kaybob Duvernay. In Nigeria, there was a reduction of 67
million BOE, primarily from gas volume changes based on reduced demand and development plan changes at Meren. In Venezuela,
there was a demotion of 48 million BOE, due to impairment and accounting methodology change. These negative revisions were
partially offset by an increase of 143 million BOE in Kazakhstan, primarily from entitlement effects at TCO and Karachaganak.
In 2020, Extensions and Discoveries of 108 million BOE in the United States were primarily due to portfolio optimizations where
future drilling in various fields is being targeted toward liquids-rich reservoirs with higher execution efficiencies in the Midland
and Delaware basins.
The differences in 2020 Extensions and Discoveries of 124 million BOE, between the net quantities of Proved reserves of 247
million BOE as reflected on pages 106 to 109 and net quantities of Proved Undeveloped of 123 million BOE, are primarily due to
proved extensions and discoveries that were not recognized as PUDs in the prior year but rather were recognized directly as proved
developed.
Purchases of 329 million BOE in 2020 include 326 million BOE from the Noble acquisition, primarily in Israel and the DJ basin in
the United States.
Sales of 95 million BOE in 2020 include 77 million BOE from the sale of the company’s interest in Azerbaijan.
Transfers to proved developed reserves in 2020 include 178 million BOE in the United States, primarily from the Midland and
Delaware basin developments and 84 million BOE in Canada, Kazakhstan, and other international locations. These transfers are the
consequence of development expenditures on completing wells and facilities.
During 2020, investments totaling approximately $6.3 billion in oil and gas producing activities and about $0.1 billion in non-oil
and gas producing activities were expended to advance the development of proved undeveloped reserves. In Asia, expenditures
during the year totaled approximately $3.4 billion, primarily related to development projects of the TCO affiliate in Kazakhstan.
The United States accounted for about $2.1 billion related primarily to various development activities in the Midland and Delaware
basins and the Gulf of Mexico. In Africa, about $0.3 billion was expended on various offshore development and natural gas
projects in Nigeria, Angola and Republic of Congo. Development activities in Canada and other international locations were
primarily responsible for about $0.5 billion of expenditures.
Reserves that remain proved undeveloped for five or more years are a result of several factors that affect optimal project
development and execution, such as the complex nature of the development project in adverse and remote locations, physical
limitations of infrastructure or plant capacities that dictate project timing, compression projects that are pending reservoir pressure
declines, and contractual limitations that dictate production levels.
At year-end 2020, the company held approximately 1.6 billion BOE of proved undeveloped reserves that have remained
undeveloped for five years or more. The majority of these reserves are in three locations where the company has a proven track
record of developing major projects. In Australia, approximately 400 million BOE remain undeveloped for five years or more
related to the Gorgon and Wheatstone Projects. Further field development to convert the remaining proved undeveloped reserves is
scheduled to occur in line with operating constraints and infrastructure optimization. In Africa, approximately 200 million BOE
have remained undeveloped for five years or more, primarily due to facility constraints at various fields and infrastructure
associated with the Escravos gas projects in Nigeria. Affiliates account for about 1.3 billion BOE of proved undeveloped reserves
with about 900 million BOE that have remained undeveloped for five years or more, with the majority related to the TCO affiliate
in Kazakhstan. At TCO, further field development to convert the remaining proved undeveloped reserves is scheduled to occur in
line with reservoir depletion and facility constraints.
Annually, the company assesses whether any changes have occurred in facts or circumstances, such as changes to development
plans, regulations or government policies, that would warrant a revision to reserve estimates. In 2020, decreases in commodity
prices negatively impacted the economic limits of oil and gas properties, resulting in proved reserve decreases, and positively
impacted proved reserves due to entitlement effects. The year-end reserves quantities have been updated for these circumstances
and significant changes have been discussed in the appropriate reserves
105
Supplemental Information on Oil and Gas Producing Activities - Unaudited
sections. Over the past three years, the ratio of proved undeveloped reserves to total proved reserves has ranged between 31 percent
and 38 percent.
Proved Reserve Quantities For the three years ending December 31, 2020, the pattern of net reserve changes shown in the
following tables are not necessarily indicative of future trends. Apart from acquisitions, the company’s ability to add proved
reserves can be affected by events and circumstances that are outside the company’s control, such as delays in government
permitting, partner approvals of development plans, changes in oil and gas prices, OPEC constraints, geopolitical uncertainties, and
civil unrest.
At December 31, 2020, proved reserves for the company were 11.1 billion BOE. The company’s estimated net proved reserves of
liquids including crude oil, condensate and synthetic oil for the years 2018, 2019 and 2020 are shown in the table on page 107. The

reserves of natural gas are shown on page 109.
Noteworthy changes in crude oil, condensate and synthetic oil proved reserves for 2018 through 2020 are discussed below and
shown in the table on the following page:
Revisions In 2018, improved field performance at various Gulf of Mexico fields and in the Midland and Delaware basins were
primarily responsible for the 121 million barrel increase in the United States. Improved field performance at various fields,
including Agbami in Nigeria and Moho-Bilondo in the Republic of Congo, were responsible for the 61 million barrel increase in
Africa. Reserves in Other Americas increased by 59 million barrels, primarily due to improved field performance at the Hebron
field in Canada. In Asia, improved performance across numerous assets resulted in the 37 million barrel increase.
In 2019, portfolio optimizations, where future drilling in various fields in the Midland and Delaware basins is being targeted away
from reservoirs with higher gas-to-oil ratios and lower execution efficiencies, and planned divestments in the Appalachian basin,
were primarily responsible for the 153 million barrel decrease in the United States. Operational issues with the Petropiar upgrader
in Venezuela resulted in a decrease in reserves of synthetic oil of 126 million barrels and an increase of crude oil and condensate
reserves of 105 million barrels. Reservoir management and entitlement effects were mainly responsible for 75 million barrels
increase in the TCO affiliate in Kazakhstan. Improved field performance at various fields, including Moho-Bilondo in the Republic
of Congo, Mafumeria in Angola, and Sonam in Nigeria, were responsible for the 42 million barrel increase in Africa.
In 2020, capital reductions and commodity price effects in the Midland and Delaware basins and Anchor in the Gulf of Mexico,
were primarily responsible for the 279 million barrels decrease in the United States. Reserves in Venezuela affiliates decreased by
149 million barrels, primarily due to impairments and accounting methodology change. Entitlement effects and performance
revisions in the TCO affiliate were primarily responsible for the 180 million barrels increase. Entitlement effects primarily
contributed to an increase of 77 million barrels synthetic oil at the Athabasca Oil sands in Canada and 74 million barrels at multiple
locations in Asia.
Extensions and Discoveries In 2018, extensions and discoveries in the Midland and Delaware basins were primarily responsible
for the 359 million barrel increase in the United States. Extensions and discoveries in the Duvernay Shale in Canada and Loma
Campana in Argentina were primarily responsible for the 31 million barrel increase in Other Americas.
In 2019, portfolio optimizations, where future drilling in various fields in the Midland and Delaware basins is being targeted
towards liquids-rich reservoirs with higher execution efficiencies, and extensions and discoveries in the deepwater fields in the Gulf
of Mexico, were primarily responsible for the 394 million barrel increase in the United States. Extensions and discoveries in Loma
Campana in Argentina were primarily responsible for the 39 million barrel increase in Other Americas.
In 2020, extensions and discoveries in the Midland and Delaware basins were primarily responsible for the 105 million barrels
increase in the United States.
Purchases In 2018, purchases of 31 million barrels in the United States were primarily in the Midland and Delaware basins.
In 2020, the acquisition of Noble assets contributed 227 million barrels in the DJ basin, Midland and Delaware basins in the United
States.
Sales In 2019, sales of 69 million barrels in Europe were in the United Kingdom and Denmark.
In 2020, sale of 99 million barrels in Asia were in Azerbaijan.

Noteworthy changes in natural gas proved reserves for 2018 through 2020 are discussed below and shown in the table above:
Revisions In 2018, reservoir performance, well test and surveillance data at Wheatstone and the greater Gorgon area were
responsible for the 1.0 TCF increase in Australia. The Bibiyana Field in Bangladesh and the Pattani Field in Thailand were
primarily responsible for the 347 BCF increase in Asia. Improved performance in the Midland and Delaware basins were primarily
responsible for the 258 BCF increase in the United States.
In 2019, strong performances at Wheatstone and the greater Gorgon areas were mainly responsible for 1.7 TCF increase in
Australia. In the TCO affiliate in Kazakhstan, reservoir management and entitlement effects were mainly responsible for 223 BCF
increase. Portfolio optimizations and low price realizations in various fields of the Midland and Delaware basins and planned
divestments in the Appalachian basin were mainly responsible for the 2.6 TCF decrease in the United States.
In 2020, the demotion of Jansz Io compression project reserves and lower field performance, partially offset by positive revisions at
Gorgon, were mainly responsible for the net 2.5 TCF decrease in Australia. Capital reductions and commodity price effects in
various fields of the Midland and Delaware basins were mainly responsible for the 509 BCF decrease in the United States. In
Africa, a 229 BCF decrease was primarily due to reduced demand and development plan changes at Meren in Nigeria.
Extensions and Discoveries In 2018, extensions and discoveries of 1.6 TCF in the United States were primarily in the Appalachian
region and the Midland and Delaware basins.
In 2019, extensions and discoveries of 1.0 TCF in the United States were primarily in the Midland and Delaware basins.

Table VI - Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows Related to Proved Oil and Gas Reserves
The standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows is calculated in accordance with SEC and FASB requirements. This
includes using the average of first-day-of-the-month oil and gas prices for the 12-month period prior to the end of the reporting
period, estimated future development and production costs assuming the continuation of existing economic conditions, estimated
costs for asset retirement obligations (includes costs to retire existing wells and facilities in addition to those future wells and
facilities necessary to produce proved undeveloped reserves), and estimated future income taxes based on appropriate statutory tax
rates. Discounted future net cash flows are calculated using 10 percent mid-period discount factors. Estimates of proved-reserve
quantities are imprecise and change over time as new information becomes available. Probable and possible reserves, which may
become proved in the future, are excluded from the calculations. The valuation requires assumptions as to the timing and amount of
future development and production costs. The calculations are made as of December 31 each year and do not represent
management’s estimate of the company’s future cash flows or value of its oil and gas reserves. In the following table, the caption
“Standardized Measure Net Cash Flows” refers to the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows.
