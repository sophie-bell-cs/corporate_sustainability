PART I
ITEMS 1 AND 2.  BUSINESS AND PROPERTIES
General
We are a publicly traded Delaware limited partnership, the common units of which are listed on the New York Stock Exchange
(“NYSE”) under the ticker symbol “EPD.”  Our preferred units are not publicly traded.  We were formed in April 1998 to own and
operate certain natural gas liquids (“NGLs”) related businesses of EPCO and are a leading North American provider of midstream
energy services to producers and consumers of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil, petrochemicals and refined products.  We are owned
by our limited partners (preferred and common unitholders) from an economic perspective. Enterprise GP, which owns a non-
economic general partner interest in us, manages our Partnership.  We conduct substantially all of our business operations through
EPO and its consolidated subsidiaries.
Our fully integrated, midstream energy asset network (or “value chain”) links producers of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil from
some of the largest supply basins in the United States (“U.S.”), Canada and the Gulf of Mexico with domestic consumers and
international markets.  Our midstream energy operations include:
•natural gas gathering, treating, processing, transportation and storage;
•NGL transportation, fractionation, storage, and marine terminals (including those used to export liquefied petroleum gases
(“LPG”) and ethane);
•crude oil gathering, transportation, storage, and marine terminals;
•propylene production facilities (including propane dehydrogenation (“PDH”) facilities), butane isomerization, octane
enhancement, isobutane dehydrogenation (“iBDH”) and high purity isobutylene (“HPIB”) production facilities;
•petrochemical and refined products transportation, storage, and marine terminals (including those used to export ethylene
and polymer grade propylene (“PGP”)); and
•a marine transportation business that operates on key U.S. inland and intracoastal waterway systems. 
Our business strategy seeks to manage these operations to:
•capitalize on expected trends and opportunities in all energy supply and demand cycles to provide value added services to
our customers;
•maintain a diversified portfolio of midstream energy assets and expand this asset base through growth capital projects and
accretive acquisitions of complementary assets that enhance our overall value chain; and
•share capital costs and risks through business ventures or alliances with strategic partners, including those that provide
incremental volumes on our systems.
Our financial position, results of operations and cash flows are contingent on the supply of, and demand for the energy
commodities we handle across our integrated midstream energy asset network.  See “Current Outlook” included under Part II, Item
7 of this annual report for management’s views on key midstream energy supply and demand fundamentals in 2023.

Table of Contents
Business Segments
The following sections provide an overview of our business segments, including information regarding principal products produced
and/or services rendered and properties owned.  Our operations are reported under four business segments:  NGL Pipelines &
Services, Crude Oil Pipelines & Services, Natural Gas Pipelines & Services and Petrochemical & Refined Products Services.
Each of our business segments benefits from the supporting role of our marketing activities.  The main purpose of our marketing
activities is to support the utilization and expansion of assets across our midstream energy asset network by increasing the volumes
handled by such assets, which results in additional fee-based earnings for each business segment.  In performing these support
roles, our marketing activities also seek to participate in supply and demand opportunities as a supplemental source of segment
gross operating margin for us.  The financial results of our marketing efforts fluctuate due to changes in volumes handled and
overall market conditions, which are influenced by current and forward market prices for the products bought and sold.
Our financial position, results of operations and cash flows are subject to certain risks. For information regarding such risks, see
“Risk Factors” included under Part I, Item 1A of this annual report.  In addition, our business activities are subject to various
federal, state and local laws and regulations governing a wide variety of topics, including commercial, operational, environmental,
safety and other matters.  For a discussion of the principal effects of such laws and regulations on our business activities, see
“Regulatory Matters” within this Part I, Items 1 and 2 discussion.
For management’s discussion and analysis of our results of operations, liquidity and capital resources and capital investment
program, see Part II, Item 7 of this annual report.
For detailed financial information regarding our business segments, including major customer information, see Note 10 of the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report.
NGL Pipelines & Services
This business segment includes our natural gas processing and related NGL marketing activities, NGL pipelines, NGL fractionation
facilities, NGL and related product storage facilities, and NGL marine terminals.
Natural gas processing and related NGL marketing activities
At the core of our natural gas processing business are processing facilities located in Colorado, Louisiana, Mississippi, New
Mexico, Texas and Wyoming.
In its raw form, natural gas produced at the wellhead (especially in association with crude oil production) contains varying amounts
of NGLs such as ethane and propane.  Natural gas streams containing NGLs and other impurities are usually not acceptable for
transportation in downstream natural gas transmission pipelines or for commercial use as fuel; therefore, the unprocessed natural
gas stream must be transported to a natural gas processing facility to remove the NGLs and other impurities. Once the natural gas is
processed and the NGLs and impurities are removed, the residue natural gas meets downstream natural gas pipeline and
commercial quality specifications.
In general, on an energy-equivalent basis, NGLs have greater economic value as feedstock for petrochemical and motor gasoline
production than as components of a natural gas stream. Typical uses of NGLs include the following:
•Ethane is primarily used in the petrochemical industry as a feedstock in the production of ethylene, one of the basic building
blocks for a wide range of plastics and other chemical products.
•Propane is used for heating, as an engine and industrial fuel, and as a petrochemical feedstock in the production of ethylene
and propylene.
•Normal butane is used as a petrochemical feedstock in the production of ethylene and butadiene (a key ingredient of
synthetic rubber), as a blendstock for motor gasoline, and to produce isobutane through isomerization.
•Isobutane is fractionated from mixed butane (a mixed stream of normal butane and isobutane) or produced from normal
butane through the process of isomerization, and is used in refinery alkylation to enhance the octane content of motor
gasoline, in the production of isooctane and other octane additives, and in the production of propylene oxide.

Table of Contents
•Natural gasoline, a mixture of pentanes and heavier hydrocarbons, is primarily used as a blendstock for motor gasoline,
diluent in crude oil to aid in transportation, and as a petrochemical feedstock.
The results of operations from natural gas processing are primarily dependent on the difference between the revenues we earn from
extracting NGLs (in terms of cash processing fees and/or the value of any retained NGLs) and the cost of natural gas and other
operating costs incurred in connection with such extraction activities.
Natural gas processing utilizes service contracts that are either fee-based, commodity-based or a combination of the two. Our
commodity-based contracts include keepwhole, margin-band, percent-of-liquids, percent-of-proceeds and contracts featuring a
combination of commodity and fee-based terms.  To the extent we retain all or a portion of the extracted NGLs as consideration for
our processing services, we refer to such volumes as our “equity NGL-equivalent production.”
If the operating costs of a natural gas processing facility are higher than the incremental value of the NGLs that would be extracted,
then recovery levels of certain NGLs, primarily ethane, may be purposefully reduced. This scenario is typically referred to as
“ethane rejection” and results in a reduction in NGL volumes available to us for subsequent transportation, fractionation, storage
and marketing.
Our NGL marketing activities entail spot and term sales of NGLs that we take title to through our natural gas processing activities
(i.e., our equity NGL-equivalent production) and open market and contract purchases. The results of operations for NGL marketing
are primarily dependent on the difference between NGL sales prices and the associated purchase and other costs, including those
costs attributable to the use of our other assets by the marketing group.  Market prices for NGLs are subject to fluctuations in
response to changes in supply and demand and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control.  We attempt to mitigate
these price risks through the use of commodity derivative instruments.  For a discussion of our commodity hedging program, see
Part II, Item 7A of this annual report.

Table of Contents
We operate all of our natural gas processing facilities except for the Venice plant.  On a weighted-average basis, utilization rates for
our natural gas processing facilities were approximately 66.5%, 58.1% and 57.6% during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021
and 2020, respectively.
Midland Basin natural gas processing facility.  The Midland Basin natural gas processing facility consists of five natural gas
processing plants, which includes four natural gas processing plants (Newberry I, Newberry II, Trident and Taylor) that we acquired
as part of our acquisition of Navitas Midstream Partners, LLC (“Navitas Midstream”) in February 2022 and a fifth natural gas
processing plant (Leiker), which we completed construction of and placed into service in March 2022.  See Part II, Item 7 of this
annual report for additional information regarding our acquisition of Navitas Midstream.
During 2022, we announced plans to construct two new natural gas processing plants in the Midland Basin, Poseidon (previously
referred to as Plant 6) and Leonidas (previously referred to as Plant 7), which are expected to be placed into service in the third
quarter of 2023 and first quarter of 2024, respectively.  Each of these plants will have the capacity to process 300 MMcf/d of
natural gas and extract over 40 MBPD of NGLs and are supported by long-term acreage dedication agreements.
Once the Poseidon and Leonidas plants are completed and placed into service, we expect to have an aggregate 1.6 Bcf/d of natural
gas processing capacity and more than 220 MBPD of NGL production capacity from our natural gas processing facility in the
Midland Basin.
Delaware Basin natural gas processing facility.  During 2022, we announced plans to construct two additional natural gas
processing plants in the Delaware Basin, the Mentone II and III plants, which are expected to be placed into service in the fourth
quarter of 2023 and first quarter of 2024, respectively.  Each of these plants will have the capacity to process 300 MMcf/d of
natural gas and extract 40 MBPD of NGLs and are supported by long-term capacity agreements.
When the Mentone II and III plants are completed and placed into service, we expect to have an aggregate 2.2 Bcf/d of natural gas
processing capacity and more than 300 MBPD of NGL production capacity from our natural gas processing facility in the Delaware
Basin.
Our NGL marketing activities utilize a fleet of approximately 480 railcars, the majority of which are leased from third parties. 
These railcars are used to deliver feedstocks to our facilities and to distribute NGLs throughout the U.S. and parts of Canada.  We
have rail loading and unloading capabilities at certain of our terminal facilities in Arizona, Kansas, Louisiana, Minnesota,
Mississippi, New York, North Carolina and Texas. These facilities service both our rail shipments and those of our customers. Our
NGL marketing activities also utilize a fleet of approximately 180 tractor-trailer tank trucks that are used to transport LPG for us
and on behalf of third parties.  We lease and operate the majority of these trucks and trailers.
NGL pipelines
Our NGL pipelines transport mixed NGLs from natural gas processing facilities, refineries and marine terminals to downstream
fractionation plants and storage facilities; gather and distribute purity NGL products to and from fractionation plants, storage and
terminal facilities, petrochemical plants, refineries and export facilities; and deliver propane and ethane to destinations along our
pipeline systems.
The results of operations from our NGL pipelines are primarily dependent upon the volume of NGLs transported (or capacity
reserved) and the associated fees we charge for such transportation services. Transportation fees charged to shippers are based on
either tariffs regulated by governmental agencies, including the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”), or contractual
arrangements.  See “Regulatory Matters” within this Part I, Items 1 and 2 for information regarding governmental regulation of our
liquids pipelines.

proportionately consolidate our 50% undivided interest in a 45-mile segment of the Port Arthur pipelines.  The remainder of these NGL pipelines are wholly
owned.
The maximum number of barrels per day that our NGL pipelines can transport depends on the operating rates achieved at a given
point in time between various segments of each system (e.g., demand levels at each injection and delivery point and the mix of
products being transported).  As a result, we measure the utilization rates of our NGL pipelines in terms of net throughput, which is
based on our ownership interest.  In the aggregate, net throughput volumes for these pipelines were 3,703 MBPD, 3,412 MBPD and
3,589 MBPD during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

Table of Contents
We operate our NGL pipelines with the exception of the Texas Express Gathering System. The following information describes our
principal NGL pipelines:
•The Mid-America Pipeline System is an NGL pipeline system consisting of the 3,119-mile Rocky Mountain pipeline, the
2,023-mile Conway North pipeline, the 632-mile Ethane-Propane (“EP”) Mix pipeline, and the 2,088-mile Conway South
pipeline. The Rocky Mountain pipeline transports mixed NGLs from production fields located in the Rocky Mountain
Overthrust and San Juan Basin to the Hobbs NGL hub located on the Texas-New Mexico border. The Conway North
segment links the NGL hub at Conway, Kansas to refineries, petrochemical plants and propane markets in the upper
Midwest. NGL hubs provide buyers and sellers with a centralized location for the storage and pricing of products, while also
providing connections to intrastate and/or interstate pipelines. The EP Mix segment transports EP mix from the Conway hub
to petrochemical plants in Iowa and Illinois. The Conway South pipeline connects the Conway hub with Kansas refineries
and provides bi-directional transportation of NGLs between the Conway and Hobbs hubs.  At the Hobbs NGL hub, the Mid-
America Pipeline System interconnects with our Seminole NGL Pipeline and Hobbs NGL fractionation and storage facility.
The Mid-America Pipeline System is also connected to 18 non-regulated NGL terminals that we own and operate.
•The South Texas NGL Pipeline System is a network of NGL gathering and transportation pipelines located in South Texas
that gather and transport mixed NGLs from natural gas processing facilities (owned by either us or third parties) to our NGL
fractionators located in South Texas and in Chambers County, Texas. In addition, this system transports purity NGL products
from our South Texas NGL fractionators to refineries and petrochemical plants located between Corpus Christi, Texas and
Houston, Texas and within the Texas City-Houston area, as well as to interconnects with other NGL pipelines and to our
Chambers County storage complex.  The South Texas NGL Pipeline System extends our ethane header system from
Chambers County, Texas to Corpus Christi, Texas.
•The Dixie Pipeline transports propane and other NGLs from locations in southeast Texas, south Louisiana and Mississippi to
markets in the southeastern U.S.  The Dixie Pipeline operates in seven states:  Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi,
North Carolina, South Carolina and Texas, and is connected to eight non-regulated propane terminals that we own and
operate.
•The Appalachia-to-Texas Express, or ATEX, pipeline transports ethane in southbound service from third-party owned NGL
fractionation plants located in Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia to our Chambers County storage complex.  Ethane
originating at these fractionation facilities is sourced from the Marcellus and Utica Shale production areas. ATEX operates in
nine states: Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana, Missouri, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas and West Virginia.
•The Chaparral NGL System transports mixed NGLs from natural gas processing facilities located in West Texas and New
Mexico to Chambers County, Texas.  This system consists of the 906-mile Chaparral pipeline and the 179-mile Quanah

•The Texas Express Pipeline extends from Skellytown, Texas to our Chambers County NGL fractionation and storage
complex.  Mixed NGLs from production fields located in the Rocky Mountains, Permian Basin and Mid-Continent regions
are delivered to the Texas Express Pipeline via an interconnect with our Mid-America Pipeline System near Skellytown.  In
addition, the Texas Express Pipeline transports mixed NGLs gathered by the Texas Express Gathering System.  Also, mixed
NGLs originating from the Denver-Julesburg (“DJ”) Basin in Colorado are transported to the Texas Express Pipeline using
the Front Range Pipeline.
•The Skelly-Belvieu Pipeline transports mixed NGLs from Skellytown, Texas to Chambers County, Texas.  The Skelly-
Belvieu Pipeline receives a significant quantity of NGLs through an interconnect with our Mid-America Pipeline System at
Skellytown.
•The Front Range Pipeline transports mixed NGLs from natural gas processing facilities located in the DJ Basin in Colorado
to an interconnect with our Texas Express Pipeline, Mid-America Pipeline System and other third-party facilities located at

Pipeline System, forms an ethane header system stretching from Corpus Christi, Texas to the Mississippi River in Louisiana.
•The Lou-Tex NGL Pipeline transports mixed NGLs, purity NGL products and refinery grade propylene (“RGP”) between the
Louisiana and Texas markets.
NGL fractionation and related facilities
Our NGL fractionators separate mixed NGLs into purity NGL products for third-party customers and our NGL marketing
activities.  Mixed NGLs extracted by domestic natural gas processing facilities represent the largest source of volumes processed at
our NGL fractionators.  Based upon industry data, we believe that sufficient volumes of mixed NGLs, especially those originating
from natural gas processing facilities located in West Texas, will be available for fractionation for the foreseeable future.
The results of operations from our NGL fractionation business are generally dependent upon the volume of mixed NGLs
fractionated and either (i) the level of fractionation fees charged (under fee-based contracts) or (ii) the value of NGLs received
(under percent-of-liquids arrangements).  Under fee-based fractionation contracts, customers retain title to the NGLs that we
process for them.  Under percent-of-liquids fractionation contracts, we retain a portion of the purity NGLs we separate for
customers and are exposed to commodity price risk through fluctuations in NGL prices.  We attempt to mitigate these risks through
the use of commodity derivative instruments.

•We own and operate NGL fractionators located in Chambers County, Texas.  These fractionators process mixed NGLs from
several major NGL supply basins in North America, including the Permian Basin, Rocky Mountains, Eagle Ford Shale, Mid-
Continent and San Juan Basin.  Our Chambers County NGL fractionators are connected to our network of NGL supply and
distribution pipelines, approximately 130 MMBbls of underground salt dome storage capacity, along with access to
international markets through our marine terminals located on the Houston Ship Channel.
In April 2022, we announced plans to construct a twelfth NGL fractionator (“Frac XII”) in Chambers County, Texas. Frac
XII is expected to be capable of processing 150 MBPD of NGLs and enter service in the third quarter of 2023. Completion
of this fractionator is expected to increase our total Chambers County NGL fractionation capacity to approximately 1.2
MMBPD.
•The Shoup and Armstrong NGL fractionators in South Texas process mixed NGLs supplied by regional natural gas
processing facilities.  Purity NGL products from these fractionators are transported to local markets in the Corpus Christi
area and also to Chambers County, Texas using our South Texas NGL Pipeline System.
•The Hobbs NGL fractionator serves NGL producers in West Texas, New Mexico, Colorado and Wyoming. This fractionator
receives mixed NGLs from several major supply basins, including the Mid-Continent, Permian Basin, San Juan Basin and
Rocky Mountains.  The facility is located at the interconnect of our Mid-America Pipeline System and Seminole NGL
Pipeline, thus providing customers access to the Conway hub and Chambers County, Texas.

usable storage capacity of 129.8 MMBbls, a brine system with approximately 36 MMBbls of above-ground brine storage capacity
and five wells used in brine production.
NGL marine terminals and related operations
We own and operate marine terminals (export and import) that handle NGLs. The results of operations from our NGL marine
terminals, all of which are located on the Houston Ship Channel, are primarily dependent upon the level of volumes handled
(loading and unloading) and the associated fees we charge for such services.
The following information describes our Houston Ship Channel terminals:
•The Enterprise Hydrocarbons Terminal (“EHT”) provides terminaling services to exporters, marketers, distributors,
chemical companies and major integrated oil companies.  EHT has extensive waterfront access consisting of eight deep-
water ship docks and a barge dock.  The terminal can accommodate vessels with up to a 45 foot draft, including Suezmax
tankers, which are the largest tankers that can navigate the Houston Ship Channel.  We believe that our location on the
Houston Ship Channel enables us to handle larger vessels than our competitors because our waterfront has fewer draft and
beam (width) restrictions.  The size and structure of our waterfront allows us to receive and unload products for our
customers and provide terminaling services.
EHT can load refrigerated cargoes of low-ethane propane and/or butane (collectively referred to as LPG) onto multiple
tanker vessels simultaneously.  Our LPG export services continue to benefit from increased NGL supplies produced from
domestic shale plays, international demand for propane as a feedstock in ethylene and propylene production, and for power
generation and heating purposes.  The current estimated maximum loading capacity for LPG at EHT is approximately 835
MBPD.  EHT has the capability to load up to six Very Large Gas Carrier (“VLGC”) vessels simultaneously, while
maintaining the option to switch between loading propane and butane.  EHT can load a single VLGC in less than 24 hours,
creating greater efficiencies and cost savings for our customers.  LPG loading volumes at EHT averaged 555 MBPD, 501
MBPD and 588 MBPD during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
11
Table of Contents
The primary customer of EHT is our NGL marketing group, which uses the terminal to meet the needs of export customers. 
NGL marketing transacts with these customers using long-term sales contracts with take-or-pay provisions and/or exchange
agreements.  In recent years, the U.S. has become the largest exporter of LPG in the world, with shipments originating from
EHT playing a key role.
EHT also includes an NGL import terminal.  This import terminal can offload NGLs from tanker vessels at rates up to 8,000
barrels per hour depending on the product.  Our NGL import volumes for the last three years were minimal.
EHT also provides terminaling services involving crude oil, propylene and refined products.  EHT’s assets and activities
associated with crude oil terminaling and storage are a component of our Crude Oil Pipelines & Services business segment. 
EHT’s activities involving propylene and refined products are a component of our Petrochemical & Refined Products
Services business segment.
•The Morgan’s Point Ethane Export Terminal, located on the Houston Ship Channel, has a nameplate loading capacity of
approximately 10,000 barrels per hour of fully refrigerated ethane and is the largest of its kind in the world. The terminal
supports domestic production of U.S. ethane from shale plays by providing the global petrochemical industry with access to
a low-cost feedstock option and opportunities for supply diversification.  Ethane volumes handled by the terminal are
sourced from our Chambers County NGL fractionation and storage complex.  Ethane loading volumes at the terminal
averaged 168 MBPD, 157 MBPD and 134 MBPD during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
In April 2022, we announced plans to build a new Ethane Export Terminal, which will be located in Orange County, Texas.  The
project is expected to be completed in 2025.
Crude Oil Pipelines & Services
This business segment includes our crude oil pipelines, crude oil storage and marine terminals, and related crude oil marketing
activities.
Crude oil pipelines
We have crude oil gathering and transportation pipelines located in Oklahoma, New Mexico and Texas. The results of operations
from our crude oil pipelines are primarily dependent upon the volume of crude oil transported (or capacity reserved) and the
associated fees we charge for such transportation services.  Transportation fees charged to shippers are based on either tariffs
regulated by governmental agencies, including the FERC, or contractual arrangements.  See “Regulatory Matters” within this Part
I, Items 1 and 2 for information regarding governmental regulation of our liquids pipelines.

The maximum number of barrels per day that our crude oil pipelines can transport depends on the operating rates achieved at a
given point in time between various segments of each system (e.g., demand levels at each delivery point and the grades of crude oil
being transported).  As a result, we measure the utilization rates of our crude oil pipelines in terms of net throughput, which is based
on our ownership interest.  In the aggregate, net throughput volumes for these pipelines were 2,222 MBPD, 2,088 MBPD and 2,166
MBPD during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
We operate our crude oil pipelines with the exception of the Basin Pipeline, Eagle Ford Crude Oil Pipeline System and Midland-to-
ECHO 3 Pipeline. The following information describes our principal crude oil pipelines:
•The Midland-to-ECHO System supports Permian Basin crude oil production by providing producers and other shippers with
transportation solutions that are both cost-efficient and operationally flexible.  After aggregating crude at our Midland
terminal, the system has the capability to transport multiple grades of crude oil, including West Texas Intermediate (“WTI”),
WTI light sweet crude oil (“West Texas Light”), West Texas Sour, and condensate, to our Enterprise Crude Houston
(“ECHO”) storage terminal (using batched shipments to safeguard crude quality) for further delivery to markets along the
Gulf Coast.  Using the ECHO terminal, shippers on the Midland-to-ECHO System have access to every refinery in Houston,
Texas City, Beaumont and Port Arthur, Texas, as well as our crude oil export terminal facilities.
The Midland-to-ECHO 1 Pipeline originates at our Midland terminal and extends 418 miles to our Sealy storage terminal. 
Volumes arriving at Sealy are then transported to our ECHO terminal using the Rancho II pipeline, which is a component of
our South Texas Crude Oil Pipeline System. The Midland-to-ECHO 1 Pipeline has an approximate maximum transportation
capacity of up to 620 MBPD, depending on certain operational variables.
The Midland-to-ECHO 2 Pipeline originates at our Midland terminal and extends 444 miles to our Sealy terminal, with
crude oil volumes arriving at Sealy transported to our ECHO terminal using the Rancho II pipeline.  The Midland-to-ECHO
2 Pipeline was created by converting the Midland-to-Sealy segment of one of our two Seminole NGL pipelines from NGL
service to crude oil service.  We retain the flexibility to convert this pipeline back to NGL service should future market
conditions support the need for additional NGL transportation capacity out of the Permian Basin. The Midland-to-ECHO 2
Pipeline has an approximate maximum transportation capacity of up to 225 MBPD, depending on certain operational
variables.

The Longhaul System consists of two approximately 500-mile, 30-inch diameter pipelines (Seaway I and the Seaway Loop)
that provide north-to-south transportation of crude oil from the Cushing hub to Seaway’s Jones Creek terminal located near
Freeport, Texas. The aggregate transportation capacity of the Longhaul System is approximately 950 MBPD, depending on
the type and mix of crude oil being transported and other variables. The Jones Creek terminal is connected by pipeline to our
ECHO terminal, which enables Seaway to serve a variety of customers along the upper Texas Gulf Coast including the
Beaumont/Port Arthur area.
The Freeport System consists of a marine terminal that facilitates both crude oil imports and exports, along with pipelines
that transport crude oil to and from Freeport, Texas and the Jones Creek terminal.
The Texas City System consists of a marine terminal and storage tanks, various pipelines and related infrastructure used to
transport crude oil to refineries in the Texas City, Texas area and to and from terminals in the Galena Park, Texas area, our
ECHO terminal and locations along the Houston Ship Channel.  The Texas City System also receives production from
certain offshore Gulf of Mexico developments. The intrastate pipeline transportation capacity of the Freeport System and
Texas City System is approximately 480 MBPD and 800 MBPD, respectively.
Seaway’s Texas City marine terminal features two docks, a 45-foot draft, an overall length of 1,125 feet, a 200-foot beam
(width) and the capacity to load crude oil at a rate of 35,000 barrels per hour.  We have used Seaway’s Texas City terminal to
partially load Very Large Crude Carrier (“VLCC”) tankers, with the remaining volumes subsequently loaded on such vessels
using lightering operations in the Gulf of Mexico.
•The West Texas System connects crude oil gathering systems in West Texas and southeast New Mexico to our terminal
facility located in Midland, Texas.  The West Texas System, including the Loving County pipeline, is a key part of our

Sea Port Oil Terminal.  In January 2019, we filed our application for regulatory permitting of our Sea Port Oil Terminal (“SPOT”)
in the Gulf of Mexico with the Department of Transportation’s Maritime Administration.  SPOT would consist of proposed onshore
and offshore facilities, including a fixed platform located approximately 30 nautical miles off the Texas coast in approximately 115
feet of water.  SPOT is designed to load VLCCs and other crude oil tankers at rates of approximately 85,000 barrels per hour.  The
platform would be connected to an onshore storage facility with approximately 4.8 MMBbls of capacity in Brazoria County, Texas,
by two 36-inch, bi-directional pipelines.  The SPOT project includes state-of-the-art pipeline control, vapor recovery and leak
detection systems that are designed to minimize emissions.  SPOT would provide customers with an integrated export solution that
leverages our extensive supply, storage and distribution network along the Gulf Coast.
In November 2022, we received a favorable Record of Decision (“ROD”) from the Department of Transportation’s Maritime
Administration in accordance with the provisions of the Deepwater Port Act of 1974.  The receipt of the ROD is a significant
milestone in the process to obtain a license for SPOT under the Deepwater Port Act.  Remaining conditions that we must address
and satisfy to obtain approval for the license issuance include routine construction, operating and decommissioning guarantees,
submission of public outreach, wetland restoration and volatile organic compound (“VOC”) monitoring plans, and other state
approvals.  We expect to satisfy these remaining conditions in 2023; however, we can give no assurance as to when or whether the
project will ultimately be authorized to begin construction or operation.
We continue to commercialize this project in order to support a final investment decision, which is subject to the execution of long-
term customer contracts and receiving a license to construct and operate the facility.
Crude oil marketing activities
Our crude oil marketing activities generate revenues from the sale and delivery of crude oil and condensate purchased either
directly from producers or from others on the open market.  The results of operations from our crude oil marketing activities are
primarily dependent upon the difference, or spread, between crude oil and condensate sales prices and the associated purchase and
other costs, including those costs attributable to the use of our assets.  In general, sales prices referenced in the underlying contracts
are market-based and include pricing differentials for factors such as delivery location or crude oil quality.  We use derivative
instruments to mitigate our exposure to commodity price risks associated with our crude oil marketing activities.  For a discussion
of our commodity hedging program, see Part II, Item 7A of this annual report.
Our Crude Oil Pipelines & Services segment also includes a fleet of approximately 245 tractor-trailer tank trucks, the majority of
which we own and operate, that are used to transport crude oil.
Natural Gas Pipelines & Services
This business segment includes our natural gas pipeline systems that provide for the gathering, treating and transportation of natural
gas.  This segment also includes our natural gas marketing activities.
Natural gas pipelines and related storage assets
Our natural gas gathering pipelines gather, treat and transport natural gas from production developments to regional natural gas
plants for further processing.  Our natural gas transmission pipelines transport natural gas from regional processing facilities to
downstream electric generation plants, local gas distribution companies, industrial and municipal customers, storage facilities or
other connecting pipelines.
The results of operations from our natural gas pipelines and related storage assets are primarily dependent upon the volume of
natural gas gathered, treated, transported or stored, the level of firm or interruptible capacity reservations made by shippers, and the
fees associated with each activity.  Transportation fees charged to shippers are based on either tariffs regulated by governmental
agencies, including the FERC, or contractual arrangements.  See “Regulatory Matters” within this Part I, Items 1 and 2 for
information regarding governmental regulation of our natural gas pipelines.

during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.  These utilization rates represent actual natural gas
volumes delivered as a percentage of our nominal delivery capacity and do not reflect firm capacity reservation agreements where
capacity fees are earned whether or not the shipper actually utilizes such capacity.
We operate our natural gas pipelines and storage facilities with the exception of the White River Hub, Old Ocean Pipeline and
certain segments of the Texas Intrastate System.  The following information describes our principal natural gas pipelines:
•The Texas Intrastate System is comprised of the 6,161-mile Enterprise Texas pipeline system and the 609-mile Channel

Natural gas marketing activities
Our natural gas marketing activities generate revenues from the sale and delivery of natural gas purchased from producers, regional
natural gas processing facilities and on the open market.  Our natural gas marketing customers include local gas distribution
companies and electric utility plants. The results of operations from our natural gas marketing activities are primarily dependent
upon the difference, or spread, between natural gas sales prices and the associated purchase and other costs, including those costs
attributable to the use of our assets.  In general, sales prices referenced in the underlying contracts are market-based and may
include pricing differentials for factors such as delivery location.
We are exposed to commodity price risk to the extent that we take title to natural gas volumes in connection with our natural gas
marketing activities and certain intrastate natural gas transportation contracts.  In addition, we purchase and resell natural gas for
certain producers that use our San Juan, Piceance, Midland Basin, Delaware Basin and Jonah Gathering Systems and certain
segments of our Acadian Gas and Texas Intrastate Systems.  Also, several of our natural gas gathering systems, while not providing
marketing services, have some exposure to risks related to fluctuations in commodity prices through transportation arrangements
with shippers.  For example, nearly all of the transportation revenues generated by our San Juan Gathering System are based on a
percentage of a regional natural gas price index.  This index may fluctuate based on a variety of factors, including changes in
natural gas supply and consumer demand.  We attempt to mitigate these price risks through the use of commodity derivative
instruments.  For a discussion of our commodity hedging program, see Part II, Item 7A of this annual report.
Petrochemical & Refined Products Services
This business segment includes our:
•propylene production facilities, which include propylene fractionation units and a PDH facility, and related pipelines and
marketing activities;
•butane isomerization complex and related deisobutanizer (“DIB”) operations;
•octane enhancement, iBDH and HPIB production facilities;
•refined products pipelines, terminals and related marketing activities;
•an ethylene export terminal and related operations; and
•marine transportation business.
Propylene production facilities and related operations
Our propylene production facilities and related operations include propylene fractionation (or splitter) units, a PDH facility,
propylene pipelines, propylene export assets and related petrochemical marketing activities.
Propylene production and related marketing activities.  Propylene is a key feedstock used by the petrochemical industry.  There are
three grades of propylene: polymer grade propylene (“PGP”), with a minimum purity of 99.5%; chemical grade propylene
(“CGP”), with a minimum purity of approximately 93-94%; and refinery grade propylene (“RGP”), with a purity of approximately
70%.  Propylene fractionation units separate RGP, which is a mixture of propane and propylene, into either PGP or CGP.  Our PDH
facility produces PGP using propane feedstocks.  The demand for PGP primarily relates to the manufacture of polypropylene,
which has a variety of end uses including packaging film, fiber for carpets and upholstery, molded plastic parts for appliances, and
automotive, houseware and medical products.  CGP is a basic petrochemical used in the manufacturing of plastics, synthetic fibers
and foams.
To the extent we fractionate RGP for customers, we enter into toll processing arrangements.  In our petrochemical marketing
activities, we purchase RGP on the open market for fractionation at our splitter units and sell the resulting PGP to customers at
market-based prices.  The results of this marketing activity are primarily dependent upon the difference, or spread, between the
sales prices of the PGP and the associated purchase and other costs, including the costs attributable to use of our propylene
production assets and related infrastructure. To limit the exposure of these marketing activities to price risk, we attempt to match
the timing and price of our feedstock purchases with those of the sales of end products.
19
Table of Contents
Our petrochemical marketing activities also include the purchase of propane for our PDH facility to process into PGP, which is then
sold to customers under long-term sales contracts (take-or-pay arrangements) that feature minimum volume commitments and
contractual pricing that minimizes our commodity price risk.

(1) We proportionately consolidate a 66.7% undivided interest in three of the propylene splitters, which have an aggregate 38 MBPD of total plant capacity.  The
remaining three propylene fractionation units are wholly owned.
(2) Our 30% ownership interest in the BRPC facility is held indirectly through our equity method investment in Baton Rouge Propylene Concentrator LLC
(“BRPC”).
We produce PGP at our Chambers County facilities and CGP at our BRPC facility.  On a weighted-average basis, the overall
utilization rate of our propylene production facilities was approximately 90.0%, 88.7% and 79.4% during the years ended
December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Global demand for propylene is increasing; however, the use of lighter crude oil feedstocks by U.S. refiners and increased use of
ethane by steam crackers has reduced propylene production from these traditional sources.  This has led to the development of
more “on purpose” propylene production facilities such as our PDH 1 facility located in Chambers County, Texas.  This facility has
the capacity to produce up to 1.65 billion pounds per year, or approximately 25 MBPD, of PGP.  At this nameplate production rate,
the facility upgrades approximately 35 MBPD of propane as feedstock. The PDH 1 facility is integrated with our legacy Chambers
County propylene fractionation units, which provides us with operational reliability and flexibility for both the PDH facility and the
fractionation units. The construction of PDH 1 was underwritten by long-term, fee-based contracts that feature minimum volume
commitments.
In November 2022, we reached a settlement related to legal proceedings involving the former general contractor for PDH 1.  For
additional information regarding this litigation, see Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part
II, Item 8 of this annual report.
PDH 2.  In September 2019, we announced the execution of long-term, fee-based contracts with affiliates of LyondellBasell
Industries N.V. that support construction of our second PDH facility (referred to as “PDH 2”).  In June 2020, we executed
additional long-term PGP sales agreements with Marubeni Corporation in support of PDH 2.  Like PDH 1, PDH 2 is expected to
have the capacity to upgrade up to 35 MBPD of propane and produce up to 1.65 billion pounds per year of PGP.  PDH 2 is also
located in Chambers County, Texas and is scheduled to begin service in the second quarter of 2023.  Once PDH 2 is placed into
service and integrated with PDH 1 and our other propylene production facilities, we will have the capability to produce 11 billion
pounds of propylene per year.

(1) We own a 70% consolidated interest in the Taurus Pipeline through our majority owned subsidiary Steor LLC.
(2) We proportionately consolidate our 50% undivided interest in the Lake Charles PGP Pipeline.
(3) We own an 80% consolidated interest in the La Porte PGP Pipeline through our majority owned subsidiaries, La Porte Pipeline Company, L.P. and La Porte
Pipeline GP, L.L.C.
The maximum number of barrels per day that our petrochemical pipelines can transport depends on the operating rates achieved at
a given point in time between various segments of each system (e.g., demand levels at each delivery point and the mix of products
being transported).  As a result, we measure the utilization rates of our petrochemical pipelines in terms of net throughput, which is
based on our ownership interest.  Total net throughput volumes were 163 MBPD, 152 MBPD and 140 MBPD during the years
ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
With the exception of the Lake Charles PGP Pipeline in Louisiana, we operate all of our propylene production assets and related
pipelines.
Propylene export assets.  Our EHT marine terminal located on the Houston Ship Channel includes export assets capable of loading
up to 3,000 barrels per hour, or 72 MBPD, of semi-refrigerated propylene.
Isomerization and related operations
We own and operate three isomerization units located in Chambers County, Texas having an aggregate processing capacity of 116
MBPD that comprise the largest commercial isomerization facility in the U.S.  We also own and operate an 83-mile pipeline system
used to transport high-purity isobutane from Chambers County, Texas to Port Neches, Texas and to Channelview, Texas.
The demand for commercial isomerization services depends upon the energy industry’s requirements for isobutane and high-purity
isobutane in excess of the isobutane produced through the process of NGL fractionation and refinery operations.  Isomerization
units convert normal butane feedstock into mixed butane, which is a stream of isobutane and normal butane.  DIB units, of which
we own and operate ten located at our Chambers County complex, then separate the isobutane from the normal butane.  Any
remaining unconverted (or residual) normal butane generated by the DIB process is then recirculated through the isomerization
process until it has been converted into varying grades of isobutane, including high-purity isobutane.  The primary uses of
isobutane are for the production of propylene oxide, isooctane, isobutylene and alkylate for motor gasoline. We also use certain of
our DIB units to fractionate mixed butanes originating from NGL fractionation activities, imports and other sources into isobutane
and normal butane.  The operating flexibility provided by our multiple standalone DIBs enables us to capture market opportunities
resulting from fluctuations in demand and prices for different types of butanes.
The results of operations from our isomerization business are generally dependent on the volume of normal and mixed butanes
processed and the level of toll processing fees charged to customers.
Our isomerization assets provide processing services to meet the needs of third-party customers and our other businesses, including
our NGL marketing activities and octane enhancement production facility. On a weighted-average basis, the utilization rates of our
isomerization facility were approximately 93.1%, 73.3% and 82.8% during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020,
respectively.
21
Table of Contents
Octane enhancement and related operations
We own and operate an octane enhancement production facility located in Chambers County, Texas that is designed to produce
isobutylene and either isooctane or methyl tertiary butyl ether (“MTBE”).  The products produced by this facility are used by
refiners to increase octane values in reformulated motor gasoline blends.  The high-purity isobutane feedstocks consumed in the
production of these products are supplied by our isomerization units.
We sell our octane enhancement products at market-based prices.  We attempt to mitigate the price risk associated with these
products by entering into commodity derivative instruments.  To the extent that we produce MTBE, it is sold exclusively into the
export market.  We measure the utilization of our octane enhancement facility in terms of its combined isooctane, isobutylene and
MTBE production volumes, which averaged 26 MBPD, 14 MBPD and 15 MBPD during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021
and 2020, respectively.
We also own and operate a facility located on the Houston Ship Channel that produces up to 4 MBPD of HPIB and includes an
associated storage facility with 0.6 MMBbls of related product storage capacity.  The primary feedstock for this plant, an
isobutane/isobutylene mix, is produced by our octane enhancement and iBDH facilities.  HPIB is used in the production of
polyisobutylene, which is used in the manufacture of lubricants and rubber.  In general, we sell HPIB at market-based prices with a
cost-based floor.  On a weighted-average basis, utilization rates for this facility were 106.6%, 91.7% and 97.6% for the years ended
December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
The results of operations from our octane enhancement and HPIB facilities are generally dependent on the level of production
volumes and the difference, or spread, between the sales prices of the products and the associated feedstock purchase costs and
other operating expenses.
Isobutane Dehydrogenation Unit. We own and operate an iBDH facility located in Chambers County, Texas that is capable of
processing approximately 25 MBPD of butane into nearly 1 billion pounds per year of isobutylene.  Production from the iBDH
plant enables us to optimize our MTBE and high purity isobutylene assets and meet growing market demand for isobutylene.
Steam crackers and refineries have historically been the major source of propane and butane olefins for downstream use; however,
with the increased use of light-end feedstocks such as ethane, the need for “on purpose” olefins production has increased.  Like our
PDH facility, the iBDH plant helps meet market demand where traditional supplies have been reduced.  The iBDH plant increases
our production of high purity and low purity isobutylene, both of which are used as feedstocks to manufacture lubricants, rubber
products and fuel additives.
Refined products services
Our refined products services business includes refined products pipelines, terminals and associated marketing activities.
Refined products pipelines.  We own and operate the TE Products Pipeline, which is a 3,041-mile pipeline system comprised of
2,923 miles of regulated interstate pipelines and 118 miles of unregulated intrastate Texas pipelines.  The system primarily
transports refined products from the upper Texas Gulf Coast to Seymour, Indiana. From Seymour, segments of the TE Products
Pipeline extend to Chicago, Illinois; Lima, Ohio; Selkirk, New York; and a location near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.  East of
Seymour, Indiana, the TE Products Pipeline is primarily dedicated to NGL transportation service. The refined products transported
by the TE Products Pipeline are produced by refineries and include motor gasoline and distillates.  
The results of operations for this pipeline system are dependent upon the volume of products transported and the level of fees
charged to shippers.  The tariffs charged for such services are either contractual or regulated by governmental agencies, including
the FERC. See “Regulatory Matters” within this Part I, Items 1 and 2 discussion for information regarding governmental regulation
of our liquids pipelines, including tariffs charged for transportation services.
22
Table of Contents
The maximum number of barrels per day that our TE Products Pipeline can transport depends on the operating balance achieved at
a given point in time between various segments of the system (e.g., demand levels at each delivery point and the mix of products
being transported).  As a result, we measure the utilization rate of this pipeline in terms of throughput.  Aggregate throughput
volumes by product type for the TE Products Pipeline were as follows for the years indicated:
 For the Year Ended December 31,  
  2022   2021   2020  
Refined products transportation (MBPD)   447   464   419 
Petrochemical transportation (MBPD)   –   170   156 
NGL transportation (MBPD)   56   52   55 
The TE Products Pipeline system includes five non-regulated refined products truck terminals and 20.9 MMBbls of aggregate
storage capacity.
In April 2022, we announced plans for our Texas Western Products System, created by repurposing a portion of our Mid-America
Pipeline System’s Rocky Mountain segment and adding westbound service to our Chaparral Pipeline business to transport refined
products from the U.S. Gulf Coast to markets in West Texas, New Mexico, Colorado and Utah.  The system is expected to be
completed in phases beginning in the fourth quarter of 2023.
Refined products marine terminals.  We own and operate marine terminals located on the Neches River near Beaumont, Texas that
handle refined products along with crude oil.  Our Beaumont facilities include five deep-water ship docks, three barge docks and
access to approximately 10.4 MMBbls of aggregate refined products storage capacity.
We also handle refined products at EHT on the Houston Ship Channel.  In addition to providing vessel loading and unloading
services for refined products, EHT’s refined products operations include 2.4 MMBbls of aggregate storage capacity through the use
of 20 above-ground storage tanks.
The results of operations from these marine terminals are primarily dependent upon the volume handled and the associated storage
and other fees we charge.
Refined products marketing activities.  Our refined products marketing activities generate revenues from the sale and delivery of
refined products obtained on the open market.  The results of operations from our refined products marketing activities are
primarily dependent upon the difference, or spread, between product sales prices and the associated purchase and other costs,
including those costs attributable to the use of our other assets.  In general, we sell our refined products at market-based prices,
which may include pricing differentials for factors such as grade and delivery location.  We use derivative instruments to mitigate
our exposure to commodity price risks associated with our refined products marketing activities.  For a discussion of our
commodity hedging program, see Part II, Item 7A of this annual report.
Ethylene export terminal and related operations
Our ethylene export terminal located at our Morgan’s Point facility on the Houston Ship Channel features two docks with a
combined nameplate capacity to load 1 million tons of ethylene per year and a refrigerated storage tank capable of handling 66
million pounds of ethylene.  Ethylene is the primary feedstock for a wide variety of consumer products, including cell phones and
computer parts, food packaging, apparel, textiles and personal protective equipment.  We own a 50% member interest in Enterprise
Navigator Ethylene Terminal LLC, which owns the export facility.  In April 2022, we announced plans to expand the ethylene
export capacity of our Morgan’s Point facility.  The expansion project, which will be completed in two phases, will expand our
existing capacity by 50% during 2024 and to more than double our current capacity by 2025.
Our ethylene system serves as an open market storage and trading hub for the ethylene industry by incorporating storage capacity,
connections to multiple ethylene pipelines, and high-volume export capabilities.  In support of our ethylene business, our Chambers
County storage complex includes a high-capacity underground ethylene storage well having a storage capacity of 600 million
pounds of ethylene.  The storage well is connected to our Morgan’s Point ethylene export terminal and further to Bayport, Texas
through a 58-mile pipeline system.
We also operate the Baymark ethylene pipeline in South Texas, which is a leading growth area for new ethylene crackers and
related facilities.  The Baymark pipeline, which is supported by long-term customer commitments, originates in Bayport and
extends 92 miles to Markham, Texas.  We own a 70% consolidated interest in the Baymark pipeline through our majority owned
subsidiary, Baymark Pipeline LLC.  Customers using the Baymark pipeline have pipeline access to our high-capacity ethylene
storage well in Chambers County and our export terminal at Morgan’s Point.

Our marine transportation business consists of 64 tow boats and 157 tank barges used to transport refined products, crude oil,
asphalt, condensate, heavy fuel oil, LPG and other petroleum products on key U.S. inland and intracoastal waterway systems.  The
marine transportation industry uses tow boats as power sources and tank barges for freight capacity. We operate our marine
transportation assets that serve refinery and storage terminal customers along the Mississippi River, the intracoastal waterway
between Texas and Florida, and the Tennessee-Tombigbee waterway system.  We own and operate shipyard and repair facilities
located in Houma and Morgan City, Louisiana and marine fleeting facilities located in Bourg, Louisiana and Channelview, Texas.
The results of operations from our marine transportation business are generally dependent upon the level of fees charged to
transport petroleum products.
Our fleet of marine vessels operated at an average utilization rate of 92.3%, 85.2% and 86.1% during the years ended December 31,
2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Our marine transportation business is subject to regulation, including by the U.S. Department of Transportation (“DOT”),
Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Department of Commerce and the U.S. Coast Guard (“USCG”).  For information
regarding these regulations, see “Regulatory Matters – Federal Regulation of Marine Operations,” within this Part I, Items 1 and 2
discussion.
Regulatory Matters
The following information describes the principal effects of regulation on our operations, including those regulations involving
safety and environmental matters and the rates we charge customers for transportation services.
Environmental, Safety and Conservation
The safe operation of our pipelines and other assets is a top priority.  We are committed to protecting the environment and the
health and safety of the public and those working on our behalf by conducting our business activities in a safe and environmentally
responsible manner.
Occupational Safety and Health
Certain of our facilities are subject to general industry requirements of the Federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, as amended
(“OSHA”), and comparable state statutes.  We believe we are in material compliance with OSHA and similar state requirements,
including general industry standards, record keeping requirements and monitoring of occupational exposures of employees.
Certain of our facilities are also subject to OSHA Process Safety Management (“PSM”) regulations, which are designed to prevent
or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic, reactive, flammable or explosive chemicals.  These regulations
apply to any process involving certain chemicals, flammable gases or liquids at or above a specified threshold (as defined in the
regulations).  In addition, we are subject to Risk Management Plan regulations of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
(“EPA”) at certain facilities.  These regulations are intended to complement the OSHA PSM regulations.  These EPA regulations
require us to develop and implement a risk management program that includes a five-year accident history report, an offsite
consequence analysis process, a prevention program and an emergency response program.  We believe we are operating in material
compliance with the OSHA PSM regulations and the EPA’s Risk Management Plan requirements.
The OSHA hazard communication standard, the community right-to-know regulations under Title III of the federal Superfund
Amendments and Reauthorization Act, and comparable state statutes require us to organize and disclose information about the
hazardous materials used in our operations.  Certain parts of this information must be reported to federal, state and local

Pipeline Safety
We are subject to extensive regulation by the DOT as authorized under various provisions of Title 49 of the United States Code and
comparable state statutes relating to the design, installation, testing, construction, operation, replacement and management of our
pipelines and associated facilities, including breakout tanks and gas storage facilities.  These statutes require companies that own or
operate pipelines and associated facilities to (i) comply with such regulations, (ii) permit access to and copying of pertinent records,
(iii) file certain reports and (iv) provide information as required by the U.S. Secretary of Transportation.  The DOT regulates natural
gas and hazardous liquids pipelines through its Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (“PHMSA”), and in many
cases, enforcement authority is delegated to state agencies.  Noncompliance with these requirements can result in substantial
penalties.  We believe we are in material compliance with DOT regulations.
Congress has periodically amended the pipeline safety laws to become more stringent and more broadly applicable.  Similarly,
PHMSA has undertaken several actions in recent years to increase the applicability and stringency of its regulations.  Some
examples of the types of subject areas governed through the pipeline safety laws, as specified in current or pending PHMSA
regulations, include:  (i) complying with industry consensus standards for safety of pipeline breakout tanks and underground natural
gas storage facilities; (ii) maintaining and updating gas and hazardous liquid pipeline facility inspection and maintenance plans;
(iii) leak detection and repair requirements; (iv) managing the maximum pressure of a pipeline facility, depending on factors such
as its design, condition, inspection history, and material; and (v) additional integrity management, inspection, and other activities in
designated “High Consequence Areas” such as populated areas, unusually sensitive areas, and commercially navigable waterways.
The development and/or implementation of more stringent requirements pursuant to regulations implementing all of the
requirements of the pipeline safety laws, as well as any implementation of the PHMSA rules thereunder or reinterpretation of
guidance by PHMSA or any state agencies with respect thereto, may result in us incurring significant and unanticipated
expenditures to comply with such standards.  Until any proposed regulations are finalized, the impact on our operations, if any, is
not known.
Environmental Matters
Our operations are subject to various environmental and safety requirements and potential liabilities under extensive federal, state
and local laws and regulations. These include, without limitation: CERCLA; the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act
(“RCRA”); the Federal Clean Air Act (“CAA”); the Clean Water Act (“CWA”); the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (“OPA”); the OSHA;
the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act; the National Historic Preservation Act; and comparable or analogous
state and local laws and regulations.  Such laws and regulations affect many aspects of our present and future operations, and
generally require us to obtain and comply with a wide variety of environmental registrations, licenses, permits, inspections and
other approvals with respect to air emissions, water quality, wastewater discharges and solid and hazardous waste management. 
Failure to comply with these requirements may expose us to fines, penalties and/or interruptions in our operations that could have a
material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
If a leak, spill or release of hazardous substances occurs at any facilities that we own, operate or otherwise use, or where we send
materials for treatment or disposal, we could be held liable for all resulting liabilities, including investigation, remedial and clean-
up costs.  Likewise, we could be required to remove previously disposed waste products or remediate contaminated property,
including situations where groundwater has been impacted.  Any or all of these developments could have a material adverse effect
on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
We believe our operations are in material compliance with existing environmental and safety laws and regulations and that our
compliance with such regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash
flows.  However, environmental and safety laws and regulations are subject to change.  The trend in environmental regulation has
been to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may be perceived to impact the environment, and thus there can be
no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for environmental regulation compliance or remediation.  New or
revised regulations that result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions, particularly if those costs are not
fully recoverable from our customers, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash
flows.
On occasion, we are assessed monetary sanctions by governmental authorities related to administrative or judicial proceedings
involving environmental matters.  See Part I, Item 3 of this annual report for additional information.

Air Quality
Our operations are associated with regulated, permitted emissions of air pollutants.  As a result, we are subject to the CAA and
comparable state laws and regulations including state air quality implementation plans.  These laws and regulations regulate
emissions of air pollutants from various industrial sources, including certain of our facilities, and also impose various monitoring
and reporting requirements.  These laws and regulations may also require that we (i) obtain pre-approval for the construction or
modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce air emissions or result in an increase in existing levels of air
emissions, (ii) obtain and strictly comply with the requirements of air permits containing various emission and operational
limitations, or (iii) utilize specific emission control technologies to limit emissions.
Increasingly, environmental groups are challenging requests to receive, modify or renew permits and seeking to apply more
stringent provisions on applicants.  Our failure to comply with applicable requirements could subject us to monetary penalties,
injunctions, conditions or restrictions on operations, including enforcement actions, and our inability to renew or secure a needed
modification to an existing permit could adversely affect our operations.  We may also be required to incur certain capital
expenditures for air pollution control equipment in connection with obtaining and maintaining permits and approvals for air
emissions.
Water Quality
The CWA and comparable state laws impose strict controls on the discharge of petroleum and its derivatives into regulated waters. 
The CWA provides penalties for discharges of petroleum products and imposes substantial potential liability for the costs of
removing petroleum or other hazardous substances.  State laws for the control of water pollution also provide varying civil and
criminal penalties and liabilities in the case of a release of petroleum or its derivatives into navigable waters or groundwater.
Federal spill prevention control and countermeasure mandates require appropriate containment berms and similar structures to help
prevent a petroleum tank release from impacting regulated waters.  The EPA has also adopted regulations that require us to have
permits in order to discharge regulated storm water run-off.  Storm water discharge permits may also be required by certain states in
which we operate and may impose monitoring and other requirements.  The CWA prohibits discharges of dredged and fill material
in wetlands and other waters of the U.S. unless authorized by an appropriately issued permit.  We believe that our costs of
compliance with these CWA requirements will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and
cash flows.
The primary federal law for crude oil spill liability is the OPA, which addresses three principal areas of crude oil pollution:
prevention, containment and clean-up, and liability.  The OPA is applicable to regulated vessels, deep-water ports, offshore
production platforms and onshore facilities, including terminals, pipelines and transfer facilities.  In order to handle, store or
transport crude oil above certain thresholds, onshore facilities are required to file oil spill response plans with the USCG, the DOT’s
Office of Pipeline Safety (“OPS”) or the EPA, as appropriate.  Numerous states have enacted laws similar to the OPA.  Under the
OPA and similar state laws, responsible parties for a regulated facility from which crude oil is discharged may be liable for
remediation costs, including damage to surrounding natural resources.  Any unpermitted release of petroleum or other pollutants
from our pipelines or facilities could result in fines or penalties as well as significant remediation costs.
Contamination resulting from spills or releases of petroleum products is an inherent risk within the pipeline industry.  To the extent
that groundwater contamination requiring remediation exists along our pipeline systems or other facilities as a result of historical
operations, we believe any such contamination could be controlled or remedied; however, such costs are site specific and there is
no assurance that the impact will not be material in the aggregate.
Environmental groups have instituted lawsuits regarding certain nationwide permits issued by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
These permits allow for streamlined permitting of pipeline projects.  If these lawsuits are successful, timelines for future pipeline
construction projects could be adversely impacted.
Disposal of Hazardous and Non-Hazardous Wastes
In our normal operations, we generate hazardous and non-hazardous solid wastes that are subject to requirements of the federal
RCRA and comparable state statutes, which impose detailed requirements for the handling, storage, treatment and disposal of solid
waste.  We also utilize waste minimization and recycling processes to reduce the volumes of our solid wastes.
26
Table of Contents
CERCLA, also known as “Superfund,” imposes liability, often without regard to fault or the legality of the original act, on certain
classes of persons who contributed to the release of a “hazardous substance” into the environment.  These persons include the
owner or operator of a facility where a release occurred and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of hazardous
substances found at a facility.  Under CERCLA, potentially responsible parties may be subject to joint and several liability for the
costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and
for the costs of certain health studies.  Under enforcement provisions, the EPA and, in some instances, third parties can take actions
in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to seek to recover the costs they incur from the responsible
parties.  It is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property
damage allegedly caused by hazardous substances or other pollutants released into the environment.  In the course of our ordinary
operations, our pipeline systems and other facilities generate wastes that may fall within CERCLA’s definition of a “hazardous
substance” or be subject to CERCLA and RCRA remediation requirements.  It is possible that we could incur liability for
remediation, or reimbursement of remediation costs, under CERCLA or RCRA for remediation at sites we currently own or
operate, whether as a result of our or our predecessors’ operations, at sites that we previously owned or operated, or at disposal
facilities previously used by us, even if such disposal was legal at the time it was undertaken.
Endangered Species
The federal Endangered Species Act, as amended, and comparable state laws, may restrict commercial or other activities that affect
endangered and threatened species or their habitats.  Some of our current or future planned facilities may be located in areas that
are designated as a habitat for endangered or threatened species and, if so, may limit or impose increased costs on facility
construction or operation.  In addition, the designation of previously unidentified endangered or threatened species could cause us
to incur additional costs or become subject to operating restrictions or bans in the affected areas.
FERC Regulation – Liquids Pipelines
Certain of our NGL, refined products and crude oil pipeline systems provide interstate common carrier movements subject to
regulation by the FERC under the Interstate Commerce Act (“ICA”).  Pipelines providing such movements (referred to as
“interstate liquids pipelines”) include, but are not limited to, the following: ATEX, Aegis, Dixie Pipeline, TE Products Pipeline,
Front Range Pipeline, Mid-America Pipeline System, Seaway Pipeline, Seminole NGL Pipeline and Texas Express Pipeline.  These
pipelines are owned by legal entities whose movements are subject to FERC regulation, including periodic reporting requirements. 
For example, ATEX, Aegis and the TE Products Pipeline are owned by Enterprise TE Products Pipeline Company LLC
(“Enterprise TE”), which provides certain FERC-regulated movements.
The ICA prescribes that the rates we charge for transportation on these interstate liquids pipelines must be just and reasonable, and
that the rules applied to our services not unduly discriminate against or confer any undue preference upon any shipper. The FERC
regulations implementing the ICA further require that interstate liquids pipeline transportation rates and rules be filed with the
FERC.  The ICA permits interested persons to challenge proposed new or changed rates or rules, and authorizes the FERC to
investigate such changes and to suspend their effectiveness for a period of up to seven months.  Upon completion of such an
investigation, the FERC may require refunds of amounts collected above what it finds to be a just and reasonable level, together
with interest.  The FERC may also investigate, upon complaint or on its own motion, a carrier’s rates and related rules that are
already in effect.  If the FERC concludes, after holding a hearing on such complaint, that the challenged rate or rule was not just
and reasonable, it may order a carrier to change the rate or rule prospectively and pay damages (i.e., reparations) caused by the
imposition of such rate or rule for a period of up to two years prior to the filing of the complaint.
The rates charged for our interstate liquids pipeline services are generally based on a FERC-approved indexing methodology, which
allows a pipeline to charge rates up to a prescribed ceiling that changes annually based primarily on the year-to-year change in the
U.S. Producer Price Index for Finished Goods (“PPI”).  A rate increase within the indexed rate ceiling is presumed to be just and
reasonable unless a protesting party can demonstrate that the rate increase is substantially in excess of changes in the pipeline’s
operating costs.  The FERC indexing is subject to review and revision every five years.  On December 17, 2020, the FERC issued a
final rule setting the index for the five-year period beginning July 1, 2021, and ending on June 30, 2026, at PPI plus 0.78%.  On
January 20, 2022, the FERC granted rehearing of certain aspects of the final rule and revised the index level to PPI minus 0.21%
effective March 1, 2022 through June 30, 2026.  The FERC ordered pipelines with filed rates that exceed their index ceiling levels
based on PPI minus 0.21% to file rate reductions effective March 1, 2022.  Enterprise, together with a number of other midstream
companies, is currently contesting this index change in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.  This appeal
could result in a further change to the index.  As an alternative to this indexing methodology, we may also choose to support
changes in our rates based on a cost-of-service methodology, by obtaining advance approval to charge “market-based rates,” or by
charging “settlement rates” agreed to by all affected shippers.  Certain of our pipelines have been granted market-based rate
authority by the FERC, including Seaway.
27
Table of Contents
In March 2018, the FERC issued a Revised Policy Statement on the Treatment of Income Taxes (the “Revised Policy”). The
Revised Policy reversed a 13-year old policy that permitted a pipeline owned by a master limited partnership (“MLP”) to recover
an income tax allowance (“ITA”) in its cost-of-service rates, if it could demonstrate that the ultimate owners of the pipeline (i.e., the
unitholders of the MLP) have an actual or potential income tax liability. In July 2018, the FERC, in an Order on Rehearing, decided
to provide pipeline MLPs the opportunity to argue for inclusion of an ITA in cost-of-service rates on a case-by-case basis, as
opposed to having no opportunity to recover an ITA. The D.C. Circuit upheld the Revised Policy and Order on Rehearing on July
31, 2020 following court challenges initiated in September 2018.
The Revised Policy and Order on Rehearing do not impact oil and liquids pipelines with market-based rate authority, or those that
charge “settlement rates.”  Following issuance of the Revised Policy, the FERC now requires crude oil and liquids pipelines owned
by MLPs to remove the ITA from their cost-of-service reporting in FERC Form No. 6.  In its final rule issued December 17, 2020,
the FERC removed any effect of the change in ITA treatment in determining the index for rates that became effective on July 1,
2021.
Changes in the FERC’s methodologies for approving rates could adversely affect us.  In addition, challenges to our regulated rates
could be filed with the FERC and future decisions by the FERC regarding our regulated rates could adversely affect our cash
flows.  We believe the transportation rates currently charged by our interstate liquids pipelines are in accordance with the ICA and
applicable FERC regulations.  However, we cannot predict the rates we will be allowed to charge in the future for transportation
services by such pipelines.
FERC Regulation – Natural Gas Pipelines and Related Matters
Certain of our intrastate natural gas pipelines, including the Texas Intrastate System and Acadian Gas System, are subject to
regulation by the FERC under the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 (“NGPA”), in connection with the transportation and storage
services they provide pursuant to Section 311 of the NGPA.  Under Section 311, along with the FERC’s implementing regulations,
an intrastate pipeline may transport gas “on behalf of” an interstate pipeline company or any local distribution company served by
an interstate pipeline, without becoming subject to the FERC’s broader regulatory authority under the Natural Gas Act of 1938
(“NGA”).  These services must be provided on an open and nondiscriminatory basis, and the rates charged for these services may
not exceed a “fair and equitable” level as determined by the FERC in periodic rate proceedings.
In July 2018, the FERC issued a final rule to address the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on cost-of-service rates for
jurisdictional natural gas pipelines.  The final rule primarily impacts interstate pipelines regulated under the NGA.  With respect to
intrastate pipelines regulated by the FERC under the NGPA, the rule requires an intrastate pipeline with rates on file with a state
regulatory agency to file with the FERC a new rate election for its interstate rates if the state rates are reduced to reflect the reduced
income tax rates adopted in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.  As of the filing date of this annual report, we have not been required to
refile the rates for our intrastate systems as a result of this rule.
We believe that the transportation rates currently charged and the services performed by our natural gas pipelines are all in
accordance with the applicable requirements of the NGPA and FERC regulations.  However, we cannot predict the rates we will be
allowed to charge in the future for transportation services by our pipelines.
The resale of natural gas in interstate commerce is subject to FERC regulation.  In order to increase transparency in natural gas
markets, the FERC has established rules requiring the annual reporting of data regarding natural gas sales.  The FERC has also
established regulations that prohibit manipulation of energy markets.  A violation of the FERC’s regulations may subject us to civil
penalties, suspension or loss of authorization to perform services or make sales of natural gas, disgorgement of unjust profits or
other appropriate non-monetary remedies imposed by the FERC.  Pursuant to the Energy Policy Act of 2005, the potential civil and
criminal penalties for any violation of the NGA, or any rules, regulations or orders of the FERC, were approximately $1.5 million
per day per violation as of January 2023.  The Federal Trade Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission
(“CFTC”) have also issued rules and regulations prohibiting energy market manipulation.  We believe that our natural gas sales
activities are in compliance with all applicable regulatory requirements.
28
Table of Contents
State Regulation of Pipeline Transportation Services
Transportation services rendered by our intrastate liquids and natural gas pipelines are subject to regulation in many states,
including Alabama, Colorado, Illinois, Kansas, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas and Wyoming. 
Although the applicable state statutes and regulations vary widely, they generally require that intrastate pipelines publish tariffs
setting forth all rates, rules and regulations applying to intrastate service, and generally require that pipeline rates and practices be
reasonable and nondiscriminatory.
Federal Regulation of Marine Operations
The operation of tow boats, barges and marine equipment create obligations involving property, personnel and cargo under General
Maritime Law.  These obligations create a variety of risks including, among other things, the risk of collision and allision, which
may precipitate claims for personal injury, cargo, contract, pollution, third-party claims and property damages to vessels and
facilities.
We are subject to the Jones Act and other federal laws that restrict maritime transportation between U.S. departure and destination
points to vessels built and registered in the U.S. and owned and manned by U.S. citizens.  As a result of this ownership
requirement, we are responsible for monitoring the foreign ownership of our common units and other partnership interests.  If we
do not comply with such requirements, we would be prohibited from operating our vessels in U.S. coastwise trade, and under
certain circumstances we would be deemed to have undertaken an unapproved foreign transfer, resulting in severe penalties,
including permanent loss of U.S. coastwise trading rights for our vessels, fines or forfeiture of the vessels.  In addition, the USCG
and American Bureau of Shipping maintain the most stringent regime of vessel inspection in the world, which tends to result in
higher regulatory compliance costs for U.S.-flagged operators than for owners of vessels registered under foreign flags of
convenience.  Our marine operations are also subject to the Merchant Marine Act of 1936, which under certain conditions would
allow the U.S. government to requisition our marine assets in the event of a national emergency.
Climate Change Discussion
There is considerable discussion over global warming and climate change including the environmental effects of greenhouse gas
emissions and their associated consequences on global climate, oceans and ecosystems. Climate change could have a long-term
impact on our operations.  For example, our facilities that are located in low lying areas such as the coastal regions of Louisiana
and Texas may be at increased risk due to flooding, rising sea levels, or disruption of operations from more frequent and severe
weather events.  Facilities in areas with limited water availability may be impacted if droughts become more frequent or severe. 
Changes in climate or weather may hinder exploration and production activities or increase the cost of production of oil and gas
resources and consequently affect the volume of hydrocarbon products entering our system.  Changes in climate or weather may
also affect consumer demand for energy or alter the overall energy mix.
In response to governmental, scientific and public concerns that emissions of certain gases, commonly referred to as greenhouse
gases, including gases associated with oil and natural gas production such as carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide among
others, contribute to a warming of the earth’s atmosphere and other adverse environmental effects, various governmental authorities
have considered or taken actions to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases.  For example, the EPA has taken action under the CAA
to regulate greenhouse gas emissions.  In addition, certain states (individually or in regional cooperation), including states in which
some of our facilities or operations are located, have taken or proposed measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. Also,
the U.S. Congress from time to time has proposed legislative measures for imposing restrictions or requiring fees or carbon taxes
for the emission of greenhouse gases.  One such fee applicable to certain of our operations has been imposed by the Inflation
Reduction Act of 2022, and is known as the “Methane emissions and waste reduction incentive program.”
Actions have also taken place at the international level, with the U.S. being involved.  Various policies and approaches discussed
include establishing a cap on emissions, requiring efficiency measures, or providing incentives for emissions reduction, use of
renewable energy, or use of replacement fuels with lower carbon content are under discussion and have and may continue to result
in additional actions involving greenhouse gases.
29
Table of Contents
These federal, regional and state measures generally apply to industrial sources (including facilities in the oil and gas sector) and
suppliers and distributors of fuel, and could increase the operating and compliance costs of our pipelines, natural gas processing
facilities, fractionation plants and other facilities, and the costs of certain sale and distribution activities.  These regulations could
also adversely affect market demand and pricing for products handled by our midstream network, by affecting the price of, or
reducing the demand for, fossil fuels or providing competitive advantages to competing fuels and energy sources.  The potential
increase in the costs of our operations could include costs to operate and maintain our facilities, install new emission controls on
our facilities, acquire allowances to authorize our greenhouse gas emissions, pay taxes related to our greenhouse gas emissions, or
administer and manage a greenhouse gas emissions program.  While we may be able to include some or all of such increased costs
in the rates charged by our pipelines or other facilities, such recovery of costs is uncertain and may depend on events beyond our
control, including the outcome of future rate proceedings before the FERC and the provisions of any final regulations.
Finally, changes in regulatory policies or market preferences that result in a reduction in the demand for hydrocarbon products that
are deemed to contribute to greenhouse gases, or restrictions on their use, may reduce volumes available to us for processing,
transportation, marketing and storage.
Competition
NGL Pipelines & Services
Within their respective market areas, our natural gas processing facilities and related NGL marketing activities encounter
competition primarily from independent processors, major integrated oil companies, and financial institutions with commodity
trading platforms.  Each of our marketing competitors has varying levels of financial and personnel resources, and competition
generally revolves around price, quality of customer service and proximity to customers and other market hubs.  In the markets
served by our NGL pipelines, we compete with a number of intrastate and interstate pipeline companies (including those affiliated
with major oil, petrochemical and natural gas companies) and barge, rail and truck fleet operations.  In general, our NGL pipelines
compete with these entities in terms of transportation fees, reliability and quality of customer service.
Our primary competitors in the NGL and related product storage business are major integrated oil companies, chemical companies
and other storage and pipeline companies.  We compete with other storage service providers primarily in terms of the fees charged,
number of pipeline connections provided and operational dependability.  Our export terminal operations compete with those
operated by major oil and gas and chemical companies and other midstream service providers primarily in terms of loading and
offloading throughput capacity and access to related pipeline and storage infrastructure.
We compete with a number of NGL fractionators in Kansas, Louisiana, New Mexico and Texas.  Competition for such services is
primarily based on the fractionation fee charged.  However, the ability of an NGL fractionator to receive a customer’s mixed NGLs
and store and distribute the resulting purity NGL products is also an important competitive factor and is a function of having the
necessary pipeline and storage infrastructure.
Crude Oil Pipelines & Services
Within their respective market areas, our crude oil pipelines, storage and marine terminals and related marketing activities compete
with other crude oil pipeline companies, rail carriers, major integrated oil companies and their marketing affiliates, financial
institutions with commodity trading platforms and independent crude oil gathering and marketing companies.  The crude oil
business can be characterized by intense competition for supplies of crude oil at the wellhead.  Competition is based primarily on
quality of customer service, competitive pricing and proximity to customers and market hubs.
Natural Gas Pipelines & Services
In our natural gas gathering business, we encounter competition in obtaining contracts to gather natural gas supplies, particularly
new supplies.  Competition in natural gas gathering is based in large part on reputation, efficiency, system reliability, gathering
system capacity and pricing arrangements.  Our key competitors in the natural gas gathering business include independent gas
gatherers and major integrated energy companies.  Our natural gas marketing activities compete primarily with other natural gas
pipeline companies and their marketing affiliates as well as standalone natural gas marketing and trading firms.  Competition in the
natural gas marketing business is based primarily on competitive pricing, proximity to customers and market hubs, and quality of
customer service.
30
Table of Contents
Petrochemical & Refined Products Services
We compete with numerous producers of PGP, which include many of the major refiners and petrochemical companies located
along the Gulf Coast, in terms of the level of toll processing fees charged and access to pipeline and storage infrastructure.  Our
petrochemical marketing activities encounter competition from major integrated oil companies and various petrochemical
companies that have varying levels of financial and personnel resources, and competition generally revolves around product price,
quality of customer service, logistics and location.
With respect to our isomerization operations, we compete primarily with facilities located in Kansas, Louisiana and New Mexico. 
Competitive factors affecting this business include the level of toll processing fees charged, the quality of isobutane that can be
produced and access to supporting pipeline and storage infrastructure.  We compete with other octane additive manufacturing
companies primarily on the basis of price.
With respect to our TE Products Pipeline, the pipeline’s most significant competitors are third-party pipelines in the areas where it
delivers products.  Competition among common carrier pipelines is based primarily on transportation fees, quality of customer
service and proximity to end users. Trucks, barges and railroads competitively deliver products into some of the markets served by
our TE Products Pipeline and river terminals.  The TE Products Pipeline also faces competition from rail and pipeline movements
of NGLs from Canada and waterborne imports into terminals located along the upper East Coast.
Our marine transportation business competes with other inland marine transportation companies as well as providers of other
modes of transportation, such as rail tank cars, tractor-trailer tank trucks and, to a limited extent, pipelines.  Competition within the
marine transportation business is largely based on performance and price. Also, substantial new construction of inland marine
vessels could create an oversupply and intensify competition for our marine transportation business. 
For a discussion of the general risks involving competition, see “We face competition from third parties in our midstream energy
businesses” under Part I, Item 1A of this annual report.
Seasonality
Although the majority of our businesses are not materially affected by seasonality, certain aspects of our operations are impacted by
seasonal changes such as tropical weather events, energy demand in connection with heating and cooling requirements and for the
summer driving season.  Examples include:
•Our operations along the Gulf Coast, including those at our Chambers County complex, may be affected by weather events
such as hurricanes and tropical storms, which generally arise during the summer and fall months.
•Residential demand for natural gas typically peaks during the winter months in connection with heating needs and during the
summer months for power generation for air conditioning. These seasonal trends affect throughput volumes on our natural
gas pipelines and associated natural gas storage levels and marketing results.
•Residential demand for propane typically peaks during the winter months in connection with heating needs in rural areas.
These seasonal trends can affect throughput volumes on our TE Products Pipeline, Dixie Pipeline and Mid-America Pipeline
System and associated terminals.
•Due to increased demand for fuel additives used in the production of motor gasoline, our isomerization and octane
enhancement businesses experience higher levels of demand during the summer driving season, which typically occurs in
the spring and summer months.  Likewise, shipments of refined products and normal butane experience similar changes in
demand due to their use in motor fuels.
•Extreme temperatures and ice during the winter months can negatively impact our gas processing plants as they may
experience freeze offs.  In addition, these conditions can negatively affect our trucking and inland marine operations on the
upper Mississippi and Illinois rivers.

Workforce and Related Matters
Like many publicly-traded partnerships, we have no direct employees.  All of our management, administrative and operating
functions are performed by employees of EPCO pursuant to an administrative services agreement (the “ASA”) or by other service
providers.  The culture of our workforce is one of ownership, integrity, and opportunity. We recognize the hard work and
contributions of individuals in our workforce who strive to further our goals.  We promote an environment where our employees
feel that working for us is more than just a job; it is a tight-knit community that looks out for one another.  We respect employees’
differences and believe everyone should be treated with fairness and respect. We value diverse ideas and perspectives, and are
committed to promoting a safe and inclusive workforce.
As of February 1, 2023, there were approximately 7,300 EPCO personnel who spend all or a substantial portion of their time
engaged in our business.  From a diversity perspective, approximately 14% of these personnel were female and approximately 32%
of these personnel were minorities.  We believe that the diversity of our workforce compares favorably to that of related energy
industries.
The health and safety of those working on our behalf is a top priority. We promote a culture in which all personnel share the same
commitment to health and safety, and recognize the importance of mitigating risks.  Acting upon our commitment to safety, we
engage all levels of employees and management, our Board, our contractors, and various external entities and organizations.  We
strive to achieve a goal of zero incidents and injuries.  We track our safety performance by monitoring our Total Recordable
Incident Rate (“TRIR”), which is an OSHA measure that generally reflects the number of recordable incidents per 100 full-time
workers during a one-year period.  Our TRIR for 2022 was 0.33, which compares favorably to the average TRIR for the midstream
industry over the last six years.  We strive for year-to-year improvement in our safety performance.
Title to Properties
Our real property holdings fall into two basic categories: (i) parcels that we and our unconsolidated affiliates own in fee (e.g., we
own the land upon which our Chambers County complex is constructed) and (ii) parcels in which our interests and those of our
unconsolidated affiliates are derived from leases, easements, rights-of-way, permits or licenses from landowners or governmental
authorities permitting the use of such land for our operations.  The fee sites upon which our significant facilities are located have
been owned by us or our predecessors in title for many years without any material challenge known to us relating to title to the land
upon which the assets are located, and we believe that we have satisfactory title to such fee sites.  We and our affiliates have no
knowledge of any material challenge to the underlying fee title of any material lease, easement, right-of-way, permit or license held
by us or to our rights pursuant to any material lease, easement, right-of-way, permit or license, and we believe that we have
satisfactory rights pursuant to all of our material leases, easements, rights-of-way, permits and licenses.
Available Information
As a publicly traded partnership, we electronically file certain documents with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
(“SEC”).  We file annual reports on Form 10-K; quarterly reports on Form 10-Q; and current reports on Form 8-K (as appropriate);
along with any related amendments and supplements thereto.  Occasionally, we may also file registration statements and related
documents in connection with equity or debt offerings.  The SEC maintains a website at www.sec.gov that contains reports and
other information regarding registrants that file electronically with the SEC.
We provide free electronic access to our periodic and current reports on our website, www.enterpriseproducts.com.  These reports
are available as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such materials with, or furnish such materials to, the
SEC.  You may also contact our Investor Relations department at (866) 230-0745 for paper copies of these reports free of charge.

ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS.
Summary of Key Risk Factors
An investment in our common units or debt securities involves certain risks.  If any of the following key risks were to occur, it
could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows, as well as our ability to maintain
or increase distribution levels.  In any such circumstance and others described below, the trading price of our securities could
decline and you could lose part or all of your investment.
Risks Relating to Our Business
•Certain developments in the global oil and gas markets, including impacts of COVID-19, the Russian invasion of Ukraine
and related sanctions, have had, and may continue to have, material adverse consequences for general economic, financial
and business conditions, and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and
liquidity and those of our customers, suppliers and other counterparties.
•Changes in price levels could negatively impact our revenue, our expenses, or both, which could adversely affect our
business.
•Changes in demand for and prices and production of hydrocarbon products could have a material adverse effect on our
financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
•Our debt level may limit our future financial and operating flexibility.
•We may not be able to fully execute our growth strategy if we encounter illiquid capital markets or increased competition for
investment opportunities.
•Our construction of new assets is subject to operational, regulatory, environmental, political, geopolitical, legal and
economic risks, which may result in delays, increased costs or decreased cash flows.
•Several of our assets have been in service for many years and require significant expenditures to maintain them.  As a result,
an increase in future maintenance or repair costs or delays in completing necessary maintenance or repair activities could
have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
•The inability to continue to access lands owned by third parties and governmental bodies could adversely affect our
operations and have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
•Our growth strategy may adversely affect our results of operations if we do not successfully integrate and manage the
businesses that we acquire or if we substantially increase our indebtedness and contingent liabilities to make acquisitions.
•A natural disaster, catastrophe, terrorist attack or other extraordinary event could result in severe personal injury, property
damage and environmental damage, which could curtail our operations and have a material adverse effect on our financial
position, results of operations and cash flows.
•A cyber-attack on our information technology (“IT”) systems could affect our business and assets, and have a material
adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
•Our business requires extensive credit risk management that may not be adequate to protect against customer nonpayment.
•The use of derivative financial instruments could result in material financial losses by us.
•Our risk management policies cannot eliminate all commodity price risks.  In addition, any noncompliance with our risk
management policies could result in significant financial losses.
•Federal, state or local regulatory measures (including those related to climate, environmental, health, safety and pipeline
integrity matters) could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

•The rates of our regulated assets are subject to review and possible adjustment by federal and state regulators, which could
adversely affect our revenues.
•Our standalone operating cash flow is derived primarily from cash distributions we receive from EPO.
Risks Relating to Our Partnership Structure
•We may not have sufficient operating cash flows to pay cash distributions at the current level following establishment of
cash reserves and payments of fees and expenses.
•Our general partner and its affiliates have limited fiduciary responsibilities to, and conflicts of interest with respect to, our
partnership, which may permit it to favor its own interests to your detriment.
•Unitholders have limited voting rights and are not entitled to elect our general partner or its directors.  In addition, even if
unitholders are dissatisfied, they cannot easily remove our general partner.
•Our partnership agreement restricts the voting rights of unitholders owning 20% or more of our common units.
•Our general partner has a limited call right that may require common unitholders to sell their common units at an undesirable
time or price.
•Our common unitholders may not have limited liability if a court finds that limited partner actions constitute control of our
business.
•Unitholders may have a liability to repay distributions.
•Our general partner’s interest in us and the control of our general partner may be transferred to a third party without
unitholder consent.
Tax Risks to Common Unitholders
•Our tax treatment depends on our status as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, which could be subject to potential
legislative, judicial or administrative changes and differing interpretations, possibly on a retroactive basis.
•A successful IRS contest of the federal income tax positions we take and certain valuation methodologies we adopt in
determining a unitholder’s allocation of income, gain, loss and deductions may adversely impact the market for our common
units and the cost of any IRS contest will reduce our cash available for distribution to unitholders.
•If the IRS makes audit adjustments to our income tax returns, it (and some states) may assess and collect any taxes
(including any applicable penalties and interest) resulting from such audit adjustment directly from us, in which case we
would pay the taxes directly to the IRS and our cash available for distribution to our unitholders might be substantially
reduced.
•Our unitholders may be required to pay taxes on their share of our income even if they do not receive any cash distributions
from us.
•Tax gains or losses on the disposition of our common units could be more or less than expected.
•We treat each purchaser of our common units as having the same tax benefits without regard to the common units
purchased.  The IRS may challenge this treatment, which could adversely affect the value of our common units.
•Our common unitholders will likely be subject to state and local taxes and return filing requirements in states where they do
not live as a result of an investment in our common units.

Discussion of Key Risk Factors
The following discussion provides additional information regarding each of our key risk factors by category:  Risks Relating to Our
Business, Risks Relating to Our Partnership Structure and Tax Risks to Common Unitholders.
Risks Relating to Our Business
Certain developments in the global oil and gas markets, including impacts from COVID-19, the Russian invasion of Ukraine and
related sanctions, have had, and may continue to have, material adverse consequences for general economic, financial and
business conditions, and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity
and those of our customers, suppliers and other counterparties.
Changes in the supply of and demand for hydrocarbon products impacts both the volume of products that we purchase and sell and
the level of services that we provide to customers, which in turn impacts our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
The COVID-19 pandemic continues to have global effects on demand, including as a result of international COVID-19
containment measures (e.g., quarantines, travel restrictions, temporary business closures and similar protective actions), and related
reduced near-term demand for hydrocarbon products.
While many countries have eased their COVID-19 containment measures and economic activity has resumed to near pre-COVID
levels, emerging variants and the potential resumption of containment measures could threaten the full recovery of hydrocarbon
demand.  A continuation of hydrocarbon demand recovery remains partially dependent on successful containment of the disease,
the efficacy and distribution of approved vaccines on COVID-19 and its emerging variants, and proven therapeutics. Any resumed
period of economic slowdown or recession, or the return to a period of depressed demand or prices for crude oil or other products
that we handle, could have significant adverse consequences on our financial condition and the financial condition of our
customers, suppliers and other counterparties, and could diminish our liquidity and negatively affect the volumes of products
handled by our pipelines and other facilities.
The Russian invasion of Ukraine and related sanctions have also significantly disrupted supply chains for crude oil, natural gas and
hydrocarbon products.  While initial impacts of the war in 2022 resulted in increased European demand for U.S. natural gas and
hydrocarbon products, we cannot predict the level of future demand, effects on domestic pricing, and impacts on U.S. oil and gas
production.  Any economic slowdown or recession in Europe or globally, including as a result of such supply chain disruptions or
sanctions, may also impact demand and depress the price for crude oil, natural gas or other products that we handle, which could
have significant adverse consequences on our financial condition and the financial condition of our customers, suppliers and other
counterparties, and could diminish our liquidity and negatively affect the volumes of products handled by our pipelines and other
facilities.
The future impact of these current events on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows depends largely on
developments outside our control, including the duration of the outbreak, the related impact on overall economic activity and the
potential long-term impacts on demand for crude oil and other products, all of which cannot be predicted with certainty.
Changes in price levels could negatively impact our revenue, our expenses, or both, which could adversely affect our business.
The operation of our assets and the execution of capital projects require significant expenditures for labor, materials, property,
equipment and services.  As a result, such costs may increase during periods of general business inflation, including as a result of
higher commodity prices, supply chain disruptions and tight labor markets.  Recent inflationary pressures affecting the general
economy and the energy industry have increased our expenses and capital costs, and those costs may continue to increase.  While
the majority of long-term contracts for our services contain index-based changes and inflation adjustments, we may not be able to
pass all of these increased costs to our customers in the form of higher fees for our services.  In addition, we use the FERC’s PPI-
based price indexing methodology to establish tariff rates in certain markets served by our pipelines.  In periods of general price
deflation, the ceiling level provided by the FERC’s PPI-based price indexing methodology could decrease, requiring us to reduce
our index-based rates, even if the actual costs we incur to operate our assets increase.  As such, our revenues and operating margins
are impacted by changes in price levels.  Prior to adjustments to our applicable rates, material cost increases may affect our
operating margins, even if margins in subsequent periods may be normalized following applicable rate adjustments.  Accordingly,
increased costs during periods of general business inflation that are not passed through to customers or offset by other factors may
have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

Changes in demand for and prices and production of hydrocarbon products could have a material adverse effect on our financial
position, results of operations and cash flows.
We operate predominantly in the midstream energy industry, which includes gathering, transporting, processing, fractionating and
storing natural gas, NGLs, crude oil, petrochemical and refined products.  As such, changes in the prices of hydrocarbon products
and in the relative price levels among hydrocarbon products could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results
of operations and cash flows.  Changes in prices may impact demand for hydrocarbon products, which in turn may impact
production, demand and the volumes of products for which we provide services.  In addition, decreases in demand may be caused
by other factors, including prevailing economic conditions, reduced demand by consumers for the end products made with
hydrocarbon products, increased competition, adverse weather conditions, public health emergencies, and government regulations
affecting prices and production levels.  We may also incur credit and price risk to the extent customers do not fulfill their
obligations to us in connection with our marketing of natural gas, NGLs, propylene, refined products and/or crude oil and long-term
take-or-pay agreements.
Crude oil and natural gas prices have been volatile in recent years.  For example, crude oil prices (based on WTI as measured by
the NYMEX) ranged from a high of $123.70 per barrel to a low of a negative $37.63 per barrel in the three year period ended
December 31, 2022.  For the period January 1, 2023 through January 31, 2023, WTI prices ranged from a high of $81.62 per barrel
to a low of $72.84 per barrel.  Natural gas prices (based on Henry Hub as measured by the NYMEX) ranged from a high of $9.68
per MMBtu to a low of $1.48 per MMBtu over the three-year period ended December 31, 2022.  Henry Hub natural gas prices
ranged from a high of $4.17 per MMBtu to a low of $2.68 per MMBtu from January 1, 2023 through January 31, 2023.
Generally, prices of hydrocarbon products are subject to fluctuations in response to changes in supply, demand, market uncertainty
and a variety of other uncontrollable factors, such as: (i) the level of domestic production and consumer product demand; (ii) the
availability of imported crude oil and natural gas and actions taken by foreign crude oil and natural gas producing nations; (iii) the
availability of transportation systems with adequate capacity; (iv) the availability of competitive fuels; (v) fluctuating and seasonal
demand for crude oil, natural gas, NGLs and other hydrocarbon products, including demand for NGL products by the
petrochemical, refining and heating industries; (vi) the impact of conservation efforts; (vii) governmental regulation and taxation of
production; (viii) reduced demand for hydrocarbons attributable to public health emergencies and (ix) prevailing economic
conditions.
We are exposed to natural gas and NGL commodity price risks under certain of our natural gas processing and gathering and NGL
fractionation contracts that provide for fees to be calculated based on a regional natural gas or NGL price index, or to be paid in-
kind by taking title to natural gas or NGLs.  A decrease in natural gas and NGL prices can result in lower margins from these
contracts, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.  Volatility in
the prices of natural gas and NGLs can lead to ethane rejection, which results in a reduction in volumes available for transportation,
fractionation, storage and marketing.  Volatility in these commodity prices may also have an impact on many of our customers,
which in turn could have a negative impact on their ability to fulfill their obligations to us.
The crude oil, natural gas and NGLs currently transported, gathered or processed at our facilities originate primarily from existing
domestic resource basins, which naturally deplete over time.  To offset this natural decline, our facilities need access to production
from newly discovered properties.  Many economic and business factors beyond our control can adversely affect the decision by
producers to explore for and develop new reserves.  These factors could include relatively low crude oil and natural gas prices, cost
and availability of equipment and labor, regulatory changes, capital budget limitations, the lack of available capital or the
probability of success in finding hydrocarbons.  A decrease in exploration and development activities in the regions where our
facilities and other energy logistic assets are located could result in a decrease in volumes handled by our assets, which could have
a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.  
For a discussion regarding our current outlook on industry fundamentals for 2023, please read “Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Current Outlook” included under Part II, Item 7 of this annual report.
We face competition from third parties in our midstream energy businesses.
Even if crude oil and natural gas reserves exist in the areas served by our assets, we may not be chosen by producers in these areas
to gather, transport, process, fractionate, store or otherwise handle the hydrocarbons extracted.  We compete with other companies,
including producers of crude oil and natural gas, for any such production on the basis of many factors, including but not limited to
geographic proximity to the production, costs of connection, available capacity, rates and access to markets.

Table of Contents
Our NGL, refined products and marine transportation businesses may compete with other pipelines and marine transportation
companies in the areas they serve.  We also compete with railroads and third party trucking operations in certain of the areas we
serve.  Competitive pressures may adversely affect our tariff rates or volumes shipped.  Also, substantial new construction of inland
marine vessels could create an oversupply and intensify competition for our marine transportation business.  
The crude oil gathering and marketing business can be characterized by intense competition for supplies of crude oil at the
wellhead.  A decline in domestic crude oil production could intensify this competition among gatherers and marketers.  Our crude
oil transportation business competes with common carriers and proprietary pipelines owned and operated by major oil companies,
large independent pipeline companies, financial institutions with commodity trading platforms and other companies in the areas
where such pipeline systems deliver crude oil.
In our natural gas gathering business, we encounter competition in obtaining contracts to gather natural gas supplies, particularly
new supplies.  Competition in natural gas gathering is based in large part on reputation, efficiency, system reliability, gathering
system capacity and pricing arrangements.  Our key competitors in the natural gas gathering business include independent gas
gatherers and major integrated energy companies.  Alternate gathering facilities are available to producers we serve, and those
producers may also elect to construct proprietary gas gathering systems.  
Both we and our competitors make significant investments in new energy infrastructure to meet anticipated market demand.  The
success of our projects depends on utilization of our assets.  Demand for our new projects may change during construction, and our
competitors may make additional investments or redeploy assets that compete with our projects and existing assets.  If either our
investments or construction by competitors in the markets we serve result in excess capacity, our facilities and assets could be
underutilized, which could cause us to reduce rates for our services.  A reduction in rates may result in lower returns on our
investments and, as a result, lower the value of our assets.
A significant increase in competition in the midstream energy industry, including construction of new assets or redeployment of
existing assets by our competitors, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash
flows.
Our debt level may limit our future financial and operating flexibility.
As of December 31, 2022, we had $25.8 billion in principal amount of consolidated senior long-term debt outstanding and $2.3
billion in principal amount of junior subordinated debt outstanding.  The amount of our future debt could have significant effects on
our operations, including, among other things:
•a substantial portion of our cash flow could be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our future debt and may
not be available for other purposes, including the payment of distributions on our common units and for capital investments;
•credit rating agencies may take a negative view of the energy sector or our consolidated debt level;
•covenants contained in our existing and future credit and debt agreements will require us to continue to meet financial tests
that may adversely affect our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in our business, including possible
acquisition opportunities;
•our ability to obtain additional financing, if necessary, for working capital, capital investments, acquisitions or other
purposes may be impaired or such financing may not be available on favorable terms;
•we may be at a competitive disadvantage relative to similar companies that have less debt; and
•we may be more vulnerable to adverse economic and industry conditions as a result of our significant debt level.
Our public debt indentures currently do not limit the amount of future indebtedness that we can incur, assume or
guarantee.  Although our credit agreements restrict our ability to incur additional debt above certain levels, any debt we may incur
in compliance with these restrictions may still be substantial.  For information regarding our long-term debt, see Note 7 of the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report.
37
Table of Contents
Our credit agreements and each of the indentures related to our public debt instruments include traditional financial covenants and
other restrictions.  For example, we are prohibited from making distributions to our partners if such distributions would cause an
event of default or otherwise violate a covenant under our credit agreements.  A breach of any of these restrictions by us could
permit our lenders or noteholders, as applicable, to declare all amounts outstanding under these debt agreements to be immediately
due and payable and, in the case of our credit agreements, terminate all commitments to extend further credit.
Our ability to access capital markets to raise capital on favorable terms could be affected by our debt level, when such debt
matures, and by prevailing market conditions.  Moreover, if the rating agencies were to downgrade the energy sector or our credit
ratings, we could experience an increase in our borrowing costs, difficulty assessing capital markets and/or a reduction in the
market price of our securities.  Such a development could adversely affect our ability to obtain financing for working capital,
capital investments or acquisitions, or to refinance existing indebtedness.  If we are unable to access the capital markets on
favorable terms in the future, we might be forced to seek extensions for some of our short-term debt obligations or to refinance
some of our debt obligations through bank credit, as opposed to long-term public debt securities or equity securities.  The price and
terms upon which we might receive such extensions or additional bank credit, if at all, could be more onerous than those contained
in existing debt agreements.  Any such arrangements could, in turn, increase the risk that our leverage may adversely affect our
future financial and operating flexibility and thereby impact our ability to pay cash distributions at expected levels.
We may not be able to fully execute our growth strategy if we encounter illiquid capital markets or increased competition for
investment opportunities.
Our growth strategy contemplates the development and acquisition of a wide range of midstream and other energy infrastructure
assets while maintaining a strong balance sheet.  This strategy includes constructing and acquiring additional assets and businesses
that enhance our ability to compete effectively and to diversify our asset portfolio, thereby providing us with more stable cash
flows.  We consider and pursue potential joint ventures, acquisitions, standalone projects and other transactions that we believe may
present opportunities to expand our business, increase our market position and realize operational synergies.
We will require substantial new capital to finance the future development and acquisition of assets and businesses.  For example,
our capital investments for 2022 reflected $5.2 billion of cash payments for capital projects, acquisitions and other
investments.  Based on information currently available, we expect our total capital investments for 2023, net of contributions from
joint venture partners, to approximate $2.7 billion to $2.9 billion, which includes growth capital projects of $2.3 billion to $2.5
billion and sustaining capital expenditures of $400 million.  These amounts do not include capital investments associated with our
proposed deep-water offshore crude oil terminal (the Sea Port Oil Terminal or “SPOT”), which remains subject to state and federal
permitting, mitigation and related requirements.  In November 2022, we received a favorable ROD from the Department of
Transportation’s Maritime Administration for SPOT; however, we can give no assurance as to when or whether the project will
ultimately be authorized to begin construction or operation.  Any limitations on our access to capital may impair our ability to
execute this growth strategy.  If our cost of debt or equity capital becomes too expensive, our ability to develop or acquire accretive
assets will be limited.  We also may not be able to raise the necessary funds on satisfactory terms, if at all.  
Any sustained tightening of the credit markets may have a material adverse effect on us by, among other things, decreasing our
ability to finance growth capital projects or business acquisitions on favorable terms and by the imposition of increasingly
restrictive borrowing covenants.  In addition, the distribution yields of any new equity we may issue may be higher than historical
levels, making additional equity issuances more expensive. Accordingly, increased costs of equity and debt will make returns on
capital expenditures with proceeds from such capital less accretive on a per unit basis.
We also may compete with third parties in the acquisition of energy infrastructure assets that complement our existing asset base. 
Increased competition for a limited pool of assets could result in our losing to other bidders more often than in the past or acquiring
assets at less attractive prices.  Either occurrence could limit our ability to fully execute our growth strategy.  Our inability to
execute our growth strategy may materially adversely affect our ability to maintain or pay higher cash distributions in the future.
Our actual construction, development and acquisition costs could materially exceed forecasted amounts.
We have announced and are engaged in multiple significant construction projects involving existing and new assets for which we
have expended or will expend significant capital.  These projects entail significant logistical, technological and staffing challenges. 
We may not be able to complete our projects at the costs we estimated at the time of each project’s initiation or that we currently
estimate.  Similarly, force majeure events such as hurricanes along the U.S. Gulf Coast may cause delays, shortages of skilled labor
and additional expenses for these construction and development projects. 
38
Table of Contents
If capital investments materially exceed expected amounts, then our future cash flows could be reduced, which, in turn, could
reduce the amount of cash we expect to have available for distribution.  In addition, a material increase in project costs could result
in decreased overall profitability of the newly constructed asset once it is placed into service.
Our construction of new assets is subject to operational, regulatory, environmental, political, geopolitical, legal and economic
risks, which may result in delays, increased costs or decreased cash flows.
One of the ways we intend to grow our business is through the construction of new midstream energy infrastructure assets.  The
construction of new assets involves numerous operational, regulatory, environmental, political, geopolitical, legal and economic
risks beyond our control and may require the expenditure of significant amounts of capital.  These potential risks include, among
other things, the following:
 
•we may be unable to complete construction projects on schedule or at the budgeted cost due to the unavailability of required
construction personnel, the unavailability of or delays in obtaining necessary materials as a result of supply chain disruptions
(including those caused by COVID-19 restrictions or geopolitical events, such as the Russian invasion of Ukraine),
accidents, weather conditions or an inability to obtain necessary permits;
•we will not receive any material increase in operating cash flows until the project is completed, even though we may have
expended considerable funds during the construction phase, which may be prolonged;
•we may construct facilities to capture anticipated future production growth in a region in which such growth does not
materialize;
•since we are not engaged in the exploration for and development of crude oil or natural gas reserves, we may not have access
to third-party estimates of reserves in an area prior to our constructing facilities in the area.  As a result, we may construct
facilities in an area where the reserves are materially lower than we anticipate;
•in those situations where we do rely on third-party reserve estimates in making a decision to construct assets, these estimates
may prove inaccurate;
•the completion or success of our construction project may depend on the completion of a third-party construction project
(e.g., a downstream crude oil refinery expansion or construction of a new petrochemical facility) that we do not control and
that may be subject to numerous of its own potential risks, delays and complexities; and
•we may be unable to obtain rights-of-way to construct additional pipelines or the cost to do so may be uneconomical.
A materialization of any of these risks could adversely affect our ability to achieve growth in the level of our cash flows or realize
benefits from expansion opportunities or construction projects, which could impact the level of cash distributions we pay to our
unitholders.
Several of our assets have been in service for many years and require significant expenditures to maintain them.  As a result, an
increase in future maintenance or repair costs or delays in completing necessary maintenance or repair activities could have a
material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
Our pipelines, terminals and storage assets are generally long-lived assets, and many of them have been in service for many years. 
The age and condition of our assets could result in increased maintenance or repair expenditures in the future.  Additionally, we
may be unable to complete maintenance or repairs due to the unavailability of necessary materials as a result of supply chain
disruptions (including those caused by COVID-19 restrictions or geopolitical events, such as the Russian invasion of Ukraine),
which may result in the suspension of operations of the impacted assets until such activities can be completed.  Any significant
increase in these expenditures or delays in completing necessary maintenance or repairs could adversely affect our results of
operations, financial position or cash flows, as well as our ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders.
39
Table of Contents
The inability to continue to access lands owned by third parties could adversely affect our operations and have a material adverse
effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
Our ability to operate our pipeline systems on certain lands owned by third parties will depend on our maintaining existing rights-
of-way and obtaining new rights-of-way on those lands. We are parties to rights-of-way agreements, permits and licenses
authorizing land use with numerous parties, including private land owners, governmental entities, Native American tribes, rail
carriers, public utilities and others. Our ability to secure extensions of existing agreements, permits and licenses is essential to our
continuing business operations, and securing additional rights-of-way will be critical to our ability to pursue expansion projects. We
cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to maintain access to all existing rights-of-way upon the expiration of the current
grants, that all of the rights-of-way will be obtained in a timely fashion or that we will acquire new rights-of-way as needed.
In particular, various federal agencies within the U.S. Department of the Interior, particularly the Bureau of Indian Affairs, Bureau
of Land Management, and the Office of Natural Resources Revenue, along with each Native American tribe, promulgate and
enforce regulations pertaining to natural gas and oil operations on Native American tribal lands. These regulations and approval
requirements relate to such matters as drilling and production requirements and environmental standards. In addition, each Native
American tribe is a sovereign nation having the right to enforce laws and regulations and to grant approvals independent from
federal, state and local statutes and regulations. These tribal laws and regulations include various taxes, fees, requirements to
employ Native American tribal members and other conditions that apply to operators and contractors conducting operations on
Native American tribal lands. One or more of these factors may increase our cost of doing business on Native American tribal lands
and impact the viability of, or prevent or delay our ability to conduct our operations on such lands.
Furthermore, whether we have the power of eminent domain for our pipelines varies from state to state, depending upon the type of
pipeline, the laws of the particular state and the ownership of the land to which we seek access. When we exercise eminent domain
rights or negotiate private agreements, we must compensate landowners for the use of their property and, in eminent domain
actions, such compensation may be determined by a court. The inability to exercise the power of eminent domain could negatively
affect our business if we were to lose the right to use or occupy the property on which our pipelines are located.
We may face opposition to the construction and operation of our pipelines and facilities from various groups.
We may face opposition to the operation of our pipelines and facilities from environmental groups, landowners, tribal groups, local
groups and other advocates. Such opposition could take many forms, including organized protests, attempts to block or sabotage
our construction activities and operations, intervention in regulatory or administrative proceedings involving our assets, or lawsuits
or other actions designed to prevent, disrupt or delay the operation of our assets and business. For example, repairing our pipelines
often involves securing consent from individual landowners to access their property; one or more landowners may resist our efforts
to make needed repairs, which could lead to an interruption in the operation of the affected pipeline or facility for a period of time
that is significantly longer than would have otherwise been the case. In addition, acts of sabotage or eco-terrorism could cause
significant damage or injury to people, property or the environment or lead to extended interruptions of our operations. Any such
event that interrupts the revenues generated by our operations, or which causes us to make significant expenditures not covered by
insurance, could reduce our cash available for paying distributions to our partners and, accordingly, adversely affect our financial
condition and the market price of our securities.
Our growth strategy may adversely affect our results of operations if we do not successfully integrate and manage the businesses
that we acquire or if we substantially increase our indebtedness and contingent liabilities to make acquisitions.
Our growth strategy includes making accretive acquisitions.  From time to time, we evaluate and acquire additional assets and
businesses that we believe complement our existing operations.  We may be unable to successfully integrate and manage the
businesses we acquire in the future.  We may incur substantial expenses or encounter delays or other problems in connection with
our growth strategy that could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
Moreover, acquisitions and business expansions involve numerous risks, such as:
•difficulties in the assimilation of the operations, technologies, services and products of the acquired assets or businesses;
•establishing the internal controls and procedures we are required to maintain under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002;
•managing relationships with new joint venture partners with whom we have not previously partnered;
40
Table of Contents
•experiencing unforeseen operational interruptions or the loss of key employees, customers or suppliers;
•inefficiencies and complexities that can arise because of unfamiliarity with new assets and the businesses associated with
them, including with their markets; and
•diversion of the attention of management and other personnel from day-to-day business to the development or acquisition of
new businesses and other business opportunities.
If consummated, any acquisition or investment would also likely result in the incurrence of indebtedness and contingent liabilities
and an increase in interest expense and depreciation, amortization and accretion expenses.  As a result, our capitalization and results
of operations may change significantly following a material acquisition.  A substantial increase in our indebtedness and contingent
liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.  In addition, any
anticipated benefits of a material acquisition, such as expected cost savings or other synergies, may not be fully realized, if at all.
Acquisitions that appear to increase our operating cash flows may nevertheless reduce our operating cash flows on a per unit
basis.
Even if we make acquisitions that we believe will increase our operating cash flows, these acquisitions may ultimately result in a
reduction of operating cash flow on a per unit basis, such as if our assumptions regarding a newly acquired asset or business did not
materialize or unforeseen risks occurred.  As a result, an acquisition initially deemed accretive based on information available at the
time could turn out not to be.  Examples of risks that could cause an acquisition to ultimately not be accretive include our inability
to achieve anticipated operating and financial projections or to integrate an acquired business successfully, the assumption of
unknown liabilities for which we become liable, and the loss of key employees or key customers.  If we consummate any future
acquisitions, our capitalization and results of operations may change significantly, and our unitholders will not have the opportunity
to evaluate the economic, financial and other relevant information that we will in making such decisions.  As a result of the risks
noted above, we may not realize the full benefits we expect from a material acquisition, which could have a material adverse effect
on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
A natural disaster, catastrophe, terrorist attack or other extraordinary event could result in severe personal injury, property damage
and environmental damage, which could curtail our operations and have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results
of operations and cash flows.
Some of our operations involve risks of personal injury, property damage and environmental damage, which could curtail our
operations and otherwise materially adversely affect our cash flow.  For example, natural gas facilities operate at high pressures,
sometimes in excess of 1,100 pounds per square inch.  In addition, our marine transportation business is subject to additional risks,
including the possibility of marine accidents and spill events.  From time to time, our octane enhancement facility may produce
MTBE for export, which could expose us to additional risks from spill events.  Virtually all of our operations are exposed to
potential natural disasters and severe weather, including hurricanes, tornadoes, storms, extreme winter events, floods and/or
earthquakes.  The location of our assets and our customers’ assets in the U.S. Gulf Coast region makes them particularly vulnerable
to hurricane or tropical storm risk.  In addition, terrorists may target our physical facilities and computer hackers may attack our
electronic systems.
If one or more facilities or electronic systems that we own or that deliver products to us or that supply our facilities are damaged by
severe weather or any other disaster, accident, catastrophe, terrorist attack or other extraordinary event, our operations could be
significantly interrupted.  These interruptions could involve significant damage to people, property or the environment, and repairs
could take from a week or less for a minor incident to six months or more for a major interruption.  Additionally, some of the
storage contracts that we are a party to obligate us to indemnify our customers for any damage or injury occurring during the period
in which the customers’ product is in our possession.  Any event that interrupts the revenues generated by our operations, or which
causes us to make significant expenditures not covered by insurance, could reduce our cash available for paying distributions and,
accordingly, adversely affect the market price of our common units.
We believe that EPCO maintains adequate insurance coverage on our behalf; however, insurance will not cover all types of
interruptions that might occur, will not cover amounts up to applicable deductibles and will not cover all risks associated with the
nature and extent of our operations.  As a result of market conditions, premiums and deductibles for certain types of insurance (e.g.,
general liability policies) can increase substantially, and in some instances, such insurance may become unavailable or available
only for reduced amounts of coverage.

Table of Contents
In the future, circumstances may arise whereby EPCO may not be able to renew existing insurance policies on our behalf or
procure other desirable insurance on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.  If we were to incur a significant liability for which
we were not fully insured, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.  In
addition, the proceeds of any such insurance may not be paid in a timely manner and may be insufficient if such an event were to
occur.
A cyber-attack on our IT systems could affect our business and assets, and have a material adverse effect on our financial position,
results of operations and cash flows.
We rely on our IT systems to conduct our business, as well as systems of third-party vendors.  These systems include information
used to operate our assets, as well as cloud-based services.  These systems are subject to possible security breaches and cyber-
attacks.
Cyber-attacks are becoming more sophisticated, and U.S. government warnings have indicated that infrastructure assets, including
pipelines, may be specifically targeted by certain groups.  These attacks include, without limitation, malicious software,
ransomware, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data, and other electronic security breaches.  These attacks, which could
increase as a result of geopolitical events (including the Russian invasion of Ukraine), may be perpetrated by state-sponsored
groups, “hacktivists”, criminal organizations or private individuals (including employee malfeasance).  These cybersecurity risks
include cyber-attacks on both us and third parties who provide material services to us.  In addition to disrupting operations, cyber
security breaches could also affect our ability to operate or control our facilities, render data or systems unusable, or result in the
theft of sensitive, confidential or customer information.  These events could also damage our reputation, and result in losses from
remedial actions, loss of business or potential liability to third parties.
We do not carry insurance specifically for cybersecurity events; however, certain of our insurance policies may allow for coverage
of associated damages resulting from such events.  If we were to incur a significant liability for which we were not fully insured, it
could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.  In addition, the proceeds of any
such insurance may not be paid in a timely manner and may be insufficient if such an event were to occur.
Failure of our critical IT systems could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash
flows, as well as our ability to pay cash distributions.
We rely on IT systems to operate our assets and manage our businesses.  We depend on these systems to process, transmit and store
electronic information, including financial records and personally identifiable information such as employee, customer, investor
and payroll data, and to manage or support a variety of business processes, including our supply chain, pipeline and storage
operations, gathering and processing operations, financial transactions, banking and numerous other processes and transactions. 
Some of these IT systems are proprietary and custom designed for our business, while others are based upon or reside on
commercially available technologies.
We have IT policies and procedures in place designed to protect our critical systems. Our cybersecurity approach is strategically
layered with people, technology and processes such as disaster recovery, incident response and business continuity. However, the
risk of critical systems failing due to an unforeseen major disruption cannot be eliminated.
Failures of these IT systems, whether due to power failures, a cybersecurity event or other reason, could result in a breach of
critical operational or financial controls and lead to unanticipated costs and a disruption of our operations, commercial activities or
financial processes. Such failures could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position or cash flow, as well as our
ability to pay cash distributions in a timely manner.  State and federal cybersecurity legislation could also impose new requirements
on us, which could increase our cost of doing business.
Our business requires extensive credit risk management that may not be adequate to protect against customer nonpayment.
We may incur credit risk to the extent customers do not fulfill their obligations to us in connection with our marketing of natural
gas, NGLs, crude oil, petrochemicals and refined products and long-term contracts with minimum volume commitments or fixed
demand charges.  Risks of nonpayment and nonperformance by customers are a major consideration in our businesses, and our
credit procedures and policies may not be adequate to sufficiently eliminate customer credit risk.  Further, adverse economic
conditions in our industry may increase the risk of nonpayment and nonperformance by customers, particularly customers that have
sub-investment grade credit ratings or small-scale companies.  We manage our exposure to credit risk through credit analysis, credit
approvals, credit limits and monitoring procedures, and for certain transactions may utilize letters of credit, prepayments, net out
agreements and guarantees.  However, these procedures and policies do not fully eliminate customer credit risk.

Table of Contents
The primary markets for our services are the Gulf Coast, Southwest, Rocky Mountains, Northeast and Midwest regions of the
U.S.  We have a concentration of trade receivable balances due from domestic and international major integrated oil and gas
companies, independent oil and gas companies and other pipelines and wholesalers operating in these markets.  These
concentrations of market areas may affect our overall credit risk in that the customers may be similarly affected by changes in
economic, regulatory or other factors.
See Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report for information
regarding our allowance for credit losses.
The use of derivative financial instruments could result in material financial losses by us.
Historically, we have sought to limit a portion of the adverse effects resulting from changes in energy commodity prices and
interest rates by using derivative instruments.  Derivative instruments typically include futures, forward contracts, swaps, options
and other instruments with similar characteristics.  Substantially all of our derivatives are used for non-trading activities.
To the extent that we hedge our commodity price and interest rate exposures, we will forego the benefits we would otherwise
experience if commodity prices or interest rates were to change in our favor.  In addition, hedging activities can result in losses that
might be material to our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  Such losses could occur under various
circumstances, including those situations where a counterparty does not perform its obligations under a hedge arrangement, the
hedge is not effective in mitigating the underlying risk, or our risk management policies and procedures are not followed.  Adverse
economic conditions (e.g., a significant decline in energy commodity prices that negatively impact the cash flows of oil and gas
producers) increase the risk of nonpayment or performance by our hedging counterparties.  
See Part II, Item 7A of this annual report and Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II,
Item 8 of this annual report for a discussion of our derivative instruments and related hedging activities.
Our risk management policies cannot eliminate all commodity price risks.  In addition, any noncompliance with our risk
management policies could result in significant financial losses.
When engaged in marketing activities, it is our policy to maintain physical commodity positions that are substantially balanced
with respect to price risks between purchases, on the one hand, and sales or future delivery obligations, on the other hand.  Through
these transactions, we seek to earn a margin for the commodity purchased by selling the commodity for physical delivery to third
party users, such as producers, wholesalers, local distributors, independent refiners, marketing companies or major integrated oil
and gas companies.  These policies and practices cannot, however, eliminate all price risks.  For example, any event that disrupts
our anticipated physical supply could expose us to risk of loss resulting from price changes if we are required to obtain alternative
supplies to cover our sales transactions.  We are also exposed to basis risks when a commodity is purchased against one pricing
index and sold against a different index.  Moreover, we are exposed to some risks that are not hedged, including price risks on
product we own, such as pipeline linefill, which must be maintained in order to facilitate transportation of the commodity in our
pipelines.  In addition, our marketing operations involve the risk of non-compliance with our risk management policies.  We cannot
assure you that our processes and procedures will detect and prevent all violations of our risk management policies, particularly if
deception or other intentional misconduct is involved.  If we were to incur a material loss related to commodity price risks,
including non-compliance with our risk management policies, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position,
results of operations and cash flows.
Our variable-rate debt, including those fixed-rate debt obligations that may be converted to variable-rate through the use of
interest rate swaps, make us vulnerable to increases in interest rates, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial
position, results of operation and cash flows.
At December 31, 2022, we had $27.5 billion in principal amount of consolidated fixed-rate debt outstanding, including current
maturities thereof.  Additionally, at December 31, 2022, we had $1.1 billion of variable-rate debt, which includes our outstanding
commercial paper notes.  Due to the short term nature of commercial paper notes, we view the interest rates charged in connection
with these instruments as variable.
The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System lowered benchmark interest rates three times during 2019 and twice during
2020.  Benchmark interest rates remained near zero during 2021 but increased seven times in 2022, once in 2023 and are expected
to rise further in 2023.  Should interest rates increase significantly, the amount of cash required to service our debt (including any
future refinancing of our fixed-rate debt instruments) would increase.  Additionally, from time to time, we may enter into interest
rate swap arrangements, which could increase our exposure to variable interest rates.  As a result, significant increases in interest
rates could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
43
Table of Contents
An increase in interest rates may also cause a corresponding decline in demand for equity securities in general, and in particular, for
yield-based equity securities such as our common units.  A reduction in demand for our common units may cause their trading price
to decline.
Amounts borrowed under EPO’s September 2022 $1.5 Billion 364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement and September 2021 $3.0
Billion Multi-Year Revolving Credit Agreement may bear interest, at our election, based on a Secured Overnight Financing Rate
(“SOFR”) or London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”), as applicable.  In addition, our junior subordinated notes and interest rate
swap agreements may also reflect LIBOR-based terms. In July 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority in the United Kingdom, or
U.K., announced a desire to phase out LIBOR as a benchmark by the end of June 2023. Financial industry working groups are
developing replacement rates and methodologies to transition existing agreements that depend on LIBOR as a reference rate.  We
currently do not expect the transition from LIBOR to have a material impact on us.
Our pipeline integrity program as well as compliance with pipeline safety laws and regulations may impose significant costs and
liabilities on us.
If we were to incur material costs in connection with our pipeline integrity program or pipeline safety laws and regulations, those
costs could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
The DOT requires pipeline operators to develop integrity management programs to comprehensively evaluate their pipelines, and
take measures to protect pipeline segments located in HCAs.  The majority of the costs to comply with this integrity management
rule are associated with pipeline integrity testing and any repairs found to be necessary as a result of such testing.  Changes such as
advances in pipeline inspection tools, identification of additional threats to a pipeline’s integrity and changes to the amount of pipe
determined to be located in HCAs can have a significant impact on the costs to perform integrity testing and repairs.  We will
continue our pipeline integrity testing programs to assess and maintain the integrity of our pipelines.  The results of these tests
could cause us to incur significant and unanticipated capital and operating expenditures for repairs or upgrades deemed necessary to
ensure the continued safe and reliable operation of our pipelines.
In total, our pipeline integrity costs for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 were $105 million, $114 million and
$83 million, respectively.  Of these annual totals, we charged $61 million, $62 million and $53 million to operating costs and
expenses during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.  The remaining annual pipeline integrity costs
were capitalized and treated as sustaining capital projects.  We expect the cost of our pipeline integrity program, regardless of
whether such costs are capitalized or expensed, to approximate $96 million for 2023.
For additional information regarding the pipeline safety regulations, see “Regulatory Matters – Environmental, Safety and
Conservation – Pipeline Safety” included under Part I, Items 1 and 2 of this annual report.
Environmental, health and safety costs and liabilities, and changing environmental, health and safety regulation, could have a
material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
Our operations are subject to various environmental, health and safety requirements and potential liabilities under extensive federal,
state and local laws and regulations.  Further, we cannot ensure that existing environmental, health and safety regulations will not
be revised or that new regulations will not be adopted or become applicable to us.  Governmental authorities have the power to
enforce compliance with applicable regulations and permits and to subject violators to civil and criminal penalties, including
substantial fines, injunctions or both.  Certain environmental laws, including CERCLA and analogous state laws and regulations,
may impose strict, joint and several liability for costs required to clean-up and restore sites where hazardous substances or
hydrocarbons have been disposed or otherwise released.  Moreover, third parties, including neighboring landowners, may also have
the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance or to recover for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by
the release of hazardous substances, hydrocarbons or other waste products into the environment.  Failure to comply with these
requirements may expose us to fines, penalties and/or interruptions in our operations that could have a material adverse effect on
our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
In addition, future environmental, health and safety law developments, such as stricter laws, regulations, permits or enforcement
policies, could significantly increase some costs of our operations. Areas of potential future environmental, health and safety law
developments include the following items.

Table of Contents
Climate Change.  Responding to reports regarding global warming and climate change matters, the U.S. Congress from time to
time has considered and adopted legislation intended to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases or implement carbon taxes.  In
addition, certain states, including states in which our facilities or operations are located, have, individually or in regional
cooperation, taken or proposed measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases.  The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act
passed in November 2021 provides for, among other things, $7.5 billion to build out a national network of electric vehicle (“EV”)
chargers in the United States, as part of a plan to accelerate the adoption of EVs, as well as funding for electric school buses and
low- and no-emission buses for public transit.  Various other policies and approaches, including establishing a cap on emissions,
requiring efficiency measures, or providing incentives for pollution reduction, use of renewable energy sources, or use of
replacement fuels with lower carbon content are under discussion and have resulted, and may continue to result, in additional
actions involving greenhouse gases.
The adoption and implementation of any federal, state or local regulations imposing reporting obligations on, or limiting emissions
of greenhouse gases from, our equipment and operations could require us to incur significant costs to reduce emissions of
greenhouse gases associated with our operations or could adversely affect demand for the crude oil, natural gas or other
hydrocarbon products that we transport, store or otherwise handle in connection with our midstream services.  The potential
increase in our operating costs could include costs to operate and maintain our facilities, install new emission controls on our
facilities, acquire allowances to authorize greenhouse gas emissions (whether emitted by our operations or associated with fuel that
we supply into the markets), pay taxes related to greenhouse gas emissions, and administer and manage a greenhouse gas emissions
program.  We may not be able to recover such increased costs through customer prices or rates, which may limit our access to, or
otherwise cause us to reduce our participation in, certain market activities.  In addition, changes in regulatory policies that result in
a reduction in the demand for hydrocarbon products that are deemed to contribute to greenhouse gases, or restrictions on their use,
may reduce volumes available to us for processing, transportation, marketing and storage.  These developments could have a
material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
In addition, numerous countries around the world have adopted, or are considering adopting laws or regulations to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions.  It is not possible to know how quickly renewable energy technologies may advance, but if significant
additional legislation and regulation were enacted, the increased use of renewable energy could ultimately reduce future demand for
hydrocarbons.  These developments could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash
flows.
We are in the process of exploring and developing opportunities to capitalize on changes in law and market dynamics relating to
greenhouse gas emissions, such as projects related to carbon capture and sequestration and the production and use of hydrogen. 
These types of projects pose a variety of risks to us, including that we could (i) overestimate market demand for such services, and
therefore divert capital from more profitable opportunities; or (ii) come to rely on temporary subsidies or similar market distortions
for an increasing portion of our revenue, which could reduce the long-term economic sustainability of our associated operations.
In March 2022, the SEC proposed new climate-related disclosure rules, which if adopted as proposed, would require significant
new climate-related disclosure in SEC filings, including certain climate-related metrics and greenhouse gas emissions data, and
third-party attestation requirements.  At this time, we cannot predict the costs of compliance with, or any potential adverse impacts
resulting from, the new rules if adopted as proposed.
Hydraulic Fracturing.  Substantially all of our producer customers employ hydraulic fracturing techniques (commonly referred to
as “fracking”) to stimulate natural gas and crude oil production from unconventional geological formations (including shale
formations), which entails the injection of pressurized fracturing fluids (consisting of water, sand and certain chemicals) into a well
bore.  The U.S. federal government, and some states and localities, have adopted, and others are considering adopting, regulations
or ordinances that could restrict hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances, or that would impose higher taxes, fees or royalties
on such activities.  Increased regulation and attention given to the hydraulic fracturing process could lead to greater opposition to
crude oil and natural gas drilling activities using hydraulic fracturing techniques, including increased litigation.  Additional
legislation or regulation could also lead to operational delays and/or increased operating costs in the production of crude oil and
natural gas (including natural gas produced from shale plays like the Permian, Eagle Ford, Haynesville, Barnett, Marcellus and
Utica Shales) incurred by our customers or could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing.  If these legislative and
regulatory initiatives cause a material decrease in the drilling of new wells and related servicing activities, it may affect the volume
of hydrocarbon products available to our midstream businesses and have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results
of operations and cash flows.
See “Regulatory Matters” under Part I, Items 1 and 2 of this annual report for more information and specific disclosures relating to
environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, and costs and liabilities.

Federal, state or local regulatory measures could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and
cash flows.
The FERC regulates our interstate liquids pipelines under the ICA.  State regulatory agencies regulate our other assets, including
intrastate natural gas and NGL pipelines, intrastate storage facilities and gathering lines.
Our intrastate NGL and natural gas pipelines are subject to regulation in many states, including Colorado, Kansas, Louisiana, New
Mexico, Texas and Wyoming.  To the extent our intrastate natural gas pipelines engage in interstate transportation, they are also
subject to regulation by the FERC pursuant to Section 311 of the NGPA.  We also have natural gas underground storage facilities in
Louisiana and Texas.  Although state regulation is typically less comprehensive in scope than regulation by the FERC, our services
are typically required to be provided on a nondiscriminatory basis and are also subject to challenge by protest and complaint.
Although our natural gas gathering systems are generally exempt from FERC regulation under the NGA, our natural gas gathering
operations could be adversely affected should they become subject to federal regulation of rates and services, or, if the states in
which we operate adopt policies imposing more onerous regulation on gas gathering operations.  Additional rules, decisions and
legislation pertaining to our assets are considered and adopted from time to time at both state and federal levels.  We cannot predict
what effect, if any, such regulatory changes and legislation might have on our operations, but we could be required to incur
additional capital expenditures.
For a general overview of federal, state and local regulation applicable to our assets, see “Regulatory Matters” included within Part
I, Items 1 and 2 of this annual report.  This regulatory oversight can affect certain aspects of our business and the market for our
products and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
The rates of our regulated assets are subject to review and possible adjustment by federal and state regulators, which could
adversely affect our revenues.
The FERC, pursuant to the ICA (as amended), the Energy Policy Act and rules and orders promulgated thereunder, regulates the
tariff rates and terms and conditions of service for our interstate common carrier liquids pipeline operations.  To be lawful under the
ICA, interstate tariff rates, terms and conditions of service must be just and reasonable and not unduly discriminatory, and must be
on file with the FERC.  In addition, pipelines may not confer any undue preference upon any shipper.  Shippers may protest (and
the FERC may investigate) the lawfulness of new or changed tariff rates.  The FERC can suspend those tariff rates for up to seven
months.  It can also require refunds of amounts collected pursuant to rates that are ultimately found to be unlawful and prescribe
new rates prospectively.  The FERC and interested parties can also challenge tariff rates that have become final and effective.  The
FERC can also order new rates to take effect prospectively and order reparations for past rates that exceed the just and reasonable
level up to two years prior to the date of a complaint.  Due to the complexity of rate making, the lawfulness of any rate is never
assured.  A successful challenge of our rates could adversely affect our revenues.
The FERC uses prescribed rate methodologies for approving regulated tariff rate changes for interstate liquids pipelines.  The
FERC’s indexing methodology currently allows a pipeline to increase its rates by a percentage linked to the Bureau of Labor’s PPI
for Finished Goods (“PPI”).   The FERC indexing is subject to review and revision every five years.  On December 17, 2020, the
FERC issued a final rule setting the index for the five-year period beginning July 1, 2021, and ending on June 30, 2026, at PPI plus
0.78%.  On January 20, 2022, the FERC granted rehearing of certain aspects of the final rule and revised the index level to PPI
minus 0.21%, effective March 1, 2022 through June 30, 2026.  The FERC ordered pipelines with filed rates that exceed their index
ceiling levels based on PPI minus 0.21% to file rate reductions effective March 1, 2022.  Pending appellate review could result in a
further change to the index.  As an alternative to this indexing methodology, we may also choose to support changes in our rates
based on a cost-of-service methodology, or by obtaining advance approval to charge “market-based rates,” or by charging
“settlement rates” agreed to by all affected shippers.  The requirements imposed by these methodologies may limit our ability to set
rates based on our actual costs or may delay our ability to charge rates reflecting increased costs.   Adverse decisions by the FERC
related to our rates could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
The intrastate liquids and natural gas pipeline transportation services we provide are subject to various state laws and regulations
that apply to the rates we charge and the terms and conditions of the services we offer.  The rates we charge and the provision of
our services may be subject to challenge at the state level and any adverse decisions could adversely affect our financial position,
results of operations and cash flows.

The adoption and implementation of new statutory and regulatory requirements for derivative transactions could have an adverse
impact on our ability to hedge risks associated with our business and increase the working capital requirements to conduct these
activities.
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act enacted in 2010 (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) provides for statutory
and regulatory requirements for swaps and other derivative transactions, including financial and certain physical oil and gas
hedging transactions.  Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFTC has adopted regulations requiring registration of swap dealers and
major swap participants, mandatory clearing of swaps, election of the end-user exception for any uncleared swaps by certain
qualified companies, recordkeeping and reporting requirements, business conduct standards and position limits among other
requirements.  Several of these requirements, including position limits rules, allow the CFTC to impose controls that could have an
adverse impact on our ability to hedge risks associated with our business and could increase our working capital requirements to
conduct these activities.
Based on an assessment of final rules promulgated by the CFTC, we have determined that we are not a swap dealer, major swap
participant or a financial entity, and therefore have determined that we currently qualify as an end-user.  In addition, the vast
majority of our derivative transactions are currently transacted through a Derivatives Clearing Organization, and we believe our use
of the end-user exception will likely not be necessary on a routine basis.  We will also seek to retain our status as an end-user by
taking reasonable measures necessary to avoid becoming a swap dealer, major swap participant or financial entity, and other
measures to preserve our ability to elect the end-user exception should it become necessary.  However, derivative transactions that
are not clearable, and transactions that are clearable but for which we choose to elect the end-user exception, are subject to
recordkeeping and reporting requirements and potentially additional credit support arrangements including cash margin or
collateral.  Posting of additional cash margin or collateral could affect our liquidity and reduce our ability to use cash for capital
investments or other company purposes.
While we believe that the majority of our hedging transactions would meet one or more of the enumerated categories for bona fide
hedges under the Dodd-Frank Act, the rules could have an adverse impact on our ability to hedge certain risks associated with our
business and could potentially affect our profitability.
Over time, the Executive Branch, the U.S. Congress and the CFTC itself may express interest in amending some of the statutory
and regulatory provisions impacting financial markets and institutions and in reevaluating some of the existing regulations and
regulatory proposals.  In addition, the make-up of the CFTC, and its Chairman, changes periodically, often year-to-year, since the
term for one CFTC seat expires each year.  Those personnel changes can also impact the regulatory agenda.  It is not clear what, if
any, changes in the law may gain sufficient support to be enacted or what, if any, changes in the existing regulations might move
forward and be adopted, or how any such changes would impact our hedging activity.
Our standalone operating cash flow is derived primarily from cash distributions we receive from EPO.
On a standalone basis, the Partnership is a holding company with no business operations and conducts all of its business through its
wholly owned subsidiary, EPO.  As a result, we depend upon the earnings and cash flows of EPO and its subsidiaries and
unconsolidated affiliates, and the distribution of their cash flows to us in order to meet our obligations and to allow us to make cash
distributions to our unitholders.
The amount of cash EPO and its subsidiaries and unconsolidated affiliates can distribute to us depends primarily on cash flows
generated from their operations.  These operating cash flows fluctuate based on, among other things, the: (i) volume of hydrocarbon
products transported on their gathering and transmission pipelines; (ii) throughput volumes in their processing and treating
operations; (iii) fees charged and the margins realized for their various storage, terminaling, processing and transportation services;
(iv) price of natural gas, crude oil, NGLs and other products; (v) relationships among natural gas, crude oil, NGL and other product
prices, including differentials between regional markets; (vi) fluctuations in their working capital needs; (vii) level of their
operating costs; (viii) prevailing economic conditions; and (ix) level of competition encountered by their businesses.  In addition,
the actual amount of cash EPO and its subsidiaries and unconsolidated affiliates will have available for distribution will depend on
factors such as: (i) the level of sustaining capital expenditures incurred; (ii) their cash outlays for expansion (or growth) capital
projects and acquisitions; and (iii) their debt service requirements and restrictions included in the provisions of existing and future
indebtedness, organizational documents, applicable state business organization laws and other applicable laws and regulations. 
Due to these factors, we may not have sufficient available cash each quarter to continue paying distributions at our current levels.

Risks Relating to Our Partnership Structure
We may issue additional securities without the approval of our common unitholders.
At any time, we may issue an unlimited number of limited partner interests of any type (to parties other than our affiliates) without
the approval of our unitholders.  Our partnership agreement does not give our common unitholders the right to approve the issuance
of equity securities, including equity securities ranking senior to our common units.  The issuance of additional common units or
other equity securities of equal or senior rank will have the following effects: (i) the ownership interest of a unitholder immediately
prior to the issuance will decrease; (ii) the amount of cash available for distribution on each common unit may decrease; (iii) the
ratio of taxable income to distributions may increase; (iv) the relative voting strength of each previously outstanding common unit
may be diminished; and (v) the market price of our common units may decline.
We may not have sufficient operating cash flows to pay cash distributions at the current level following establishment of cash
reserves and payments of fees and expenses.
Because cash distributions on our common units are dependent on the amount of cash we generate, distributions may fluctuate
based on our performance and capital needs.  We cannot guarantee that we will continue to pay distributions at the current level
each quarter.  The actual amount of cash that is available to be distributed each quarter will depend upon numerous factors, some of
which are beyond our control and the control of our general partner.  These factors include, but are not limited to: (i) the volume of
the products that we handle and the prices we receive for our services; (ii) the level of our operating costs; (iii) the level of
competition in our business; (iv) prevailing economic conditions, including the price of and demand for crude oil, natural gas,
NGLs and other products we transport, store and market; (v) the level of capital investments we make; (vi) the amount and cost of
capital we can raise compared to the amount of our capital investments and debt service requirements; (vii)  restrictions contained
in our debt agreements; (viii) fluctuations in our working capital needs; (ix) weather volatility; (x) cash outlays for acquisitions, if
any; and (xi) the amount, if any, of cash reserves required by our general partner in its sole discretion.
Furthermore, the amount of cash that we have available for distribution is not solely a function of profitability, which will be
affected by non-cash items such as depreciation, amortization and provisions for asset impairments.  Our cash flows are also
impacted by borrowings under credit agreements and similar arrangements.  As a result, we may be able to make cash distributions
during periods when we record losses and may not be able to make cash distributions during periods when we record net income. 
An inability on our part to pay cash distributions to our unitholders could have a material adverse effect on our financial position,
results of operations and cash flows.
Our general partner and its affiliates have limited fiduciary responsibilities to, and conflicts of interest with respect to, our
partnership, which may permit it to favor its own interests to your detriment.
The directors and officers of our general partner and its affiliates have duties to manage our general partner in a manner that is
beneficial to its members.  At the same time, our general partner has duties to manage our partnership in a manner that is beneficial
to us.  Therefore, our general partner’s duties to us may conflict with the duties of its officers and directors to its members.  Such
conflicts may include, among others, the following:
•neither our partnership agreement nor any other agreement requires our general partner or EPCO to pursue a business
strategy that favors us;
•decisions of our general partner regarding the amount and timing of asset purchases and sales, cash expenditures,
borrowings, issuances of additional units, and the establishment of additional reserves in any quarter may affect the level of
cash available to pay quarterly distributions to our unitholders;
•under our partnership agreement, our general partner determines which costs incurred by it and its affiliates are reimbursable
by us;
•our general partner is allowed to resolve any conflicts of interest involving us and our general partner and its affiliates, and
may take into account the interests of parties other than us, such as EPCO, in resolving conflicts of interest, which has the
effect of limiting its fiduciary duty to our unitholders;
•any resolution of a conflict of interest by our general partner not made in bad faith and that is fair and reasonable to us is
binding on the partners and is not a breach of our partnership agreement;
48
Table of Contents
•affiliates of our general partner may compete with us in certain circumstances;
•our general partner has limited its liability and reduced its fiduciary duties and has also restricted the remedies available to
our unitholders for actions that might, without the limitations, constitute breaches of fiduciary duty.  As a result of
purchasing our units, you are deemed to consent to some actions and conflicts of interest that might otherwise constitute a
breach of fiduciary or other duties under applicable law;
•we do not have any employees and we rely solely on employees of EPCO and its affiliates;
•in some instances, our general partner may cause us to borrow funds in order to permit the payment of distributions;
•our general partner may cause us to pay it or its affiliates for any services rendered to us or entering into additional
contractual arrangements with any of these entities on our behalf;
•our general partner intends to limit its liability regarding our contractual and other obligations and, in some circumstances,
may be entitled to be indemnified by us;
•our general partner controls the enforcement of obligations owed to us by our general partner and its affiliates; and
•our general partner decides whether to retain separate counsel, accountants or others to perform services for us.
We have significant business relationships with entities controlled by EPCO and Dan Duncan LLC.  For information regarding
these relationships and related party transactions with EPCO and its affiliates, see Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report.  Additional information regarding our relationship with EPCO and
its affiliates can also be found under Part III, Item 13 of this annual report.
The NYSE does not require a publicly traded limited partnership like us to comply with certain of its corporate governance
requirements.
We currently list our common units on the NYSE under the symbol “EPD.” Because we are a publicly traded limited partnership,
the NYSE does not require us to have a majority of independent directors on our general partner’s Board or to establish a
compensation committee or a nominating and corporate governance committee. Additionally, any future issuance of additional
common units or other securities, including to affiliates, will not be subject to the NYSE’s shareholder approval rules that apply to
a corporation. Accordingly, unitholders do not have the same protections afforded to certain corporations that are subject to all of
the NYSE corporate governance requirements. See Part III, Item 10 of this annual report for additional information.
Unitholders have limited voting rights and are not entitled to elect our general partner or its directors.  In addition, even if
unitholders are dissatisfied, they cannot easily remove our general partner.
Unlike the holders of common stock in a corporation, unitholders have only limited voting rights on matters affecting our business
and, therefore, limited ability to influence management’s decisions regarding our business.  Unitholders did not elect our general
partner or its directors and will have no right to elect our general partner or its directors on an annual or other continuing basis.  The
owners of our general partner choose the directors of our general partner.
Furthermore, if unitholders are dissatisfied with the performance of our general partner, they currently have no practical ability to
remove our general partner or its officers or directors.  Our general partner may not be removed except upon the vote of the holders
of at least 60% of our outstanding units voting together as a single class.  Since affiliates of our general partner currently own
approximately 32% of our outstanding common units, the removal of Enterprise GP as our general partner is highly unlikely
without the consent of both our general partner and its affiliates.  As a result of this provision, the trading price of our common
units may be lower than other forms of equity ownership because of the absence of a takeover premium in the trading price.
49
Table of Contents
Our partnership agreement restricts the voting rights of unitholders owning 20% or more of our common units.
Unitholders’ voting rights are further restricted by a provision in our partnership agreement stating that any units held by a person
that owns 20% or more of any class of our common units then outstanding, other than our general partner and its affiliates, cannot
be voted on any matter.  In addition, our partnership agreement contains provisions limiting the ability of unitholders to call
meetings or to acquire information about our operations, as well as other provisions limiting our unitholders’ ability to influence
our management.  As a result of this provision, the trading price of our common units may be lower than other forms of equity
ownership because of the absence of a takeover premium in the trading price.
Our general partner has a limited call right that may require common unitholders to sell their common units at an undesirable time
or price.
If at any time our general partner and its affiliates own 85% or more of the common units then outstanding, our general partner will
have the right, but not the obligation, which it may assign to any of its affiliates or to us, to acquire all, but not less than all, of the
remaining common units held by unaffiliated persons at a price not less than the then current market price.  As a result, common
unitholders may be required to sell their common units at an undesirable time or price and may therefore not receive any return on
their investment.  Unitholders may also incur a tax liability upon the sale of their common units.
Our common unitholders may not have limited liability if a court finds that limited partner actions constitute control of our
business.
Under Delaware law, common unitholders could be held liable for our obligations to the same extent as a general partner if a court
determined that the right of limited partners to remove our general partner or to take other action under our partnership agreement
constituted participation in the “control” of our business.  Under Delaware law, our general partner generally has unlimited liability
for our obligations, such as our debts and environmental liabilities, except for those of our contractual obligations that are expressly
made without recourse to our general partner.
The limitations on the liability of holders of limited partner interests for the obligations of a limited partnership have not been
clearly established in some of the states in which we do business. You could have unlimited liability for our obligations if a court or
government agency determined that (i) we were conducting business in a state, but had not complied with that particular state’s
partnership statute; or (ii) your right to act with other unitholders to remove or replace our general partner, to approve some
amendments to our partnership agreement or to take other actions under our partnership agreement constituted “control” of our
business.
Unitholders may have a liability to repay distributions.
Under certain circumstances, our unitholders may have to repay amounts wrongfully distributed to them.  Under Section 17-607 of
the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act, we may not make a distribution to our unitholders if the distribution would
cause our liabilities to exceed the fair value of our assets.  Liabilities to partners on account of their partnership interests and
liabilities that are non-recourse to the Partnership are not counted for purposes of determining whether a distribution is
permitted.  Delaware law provides that for a period of three years from the date of an impermissible distribution, limited partners
who received the distribution and who knew at the time of the distribution that it violated Delaware law will be liable to the limited
partnership for the distribution amount.  A purchaser of common units who becomes a limited partner is liable for the obligations of
the transferring limited partner to make contributions to the Partnership that are known to such purchaser of common units at the
time it became a limited partner, and for unknown obligations if the liabilities could be determined from our partnership agreement.
Our general partner’s interest in us and the control of our general partner may be transferred to a third party without unitholder
consent.
Our general partner, in accordance with our partnership agreement, may transfer its general partner interest without the consent of
unitholders.  In addition, our general partner may transfer its general partner interest to a third party in a merger or consolidation or
in a sale of all or substantially all of its assets without the consent of our unitholders.  Furthermore, there is no restriction in our
partnership agreement on the ability of the sole member of our general partner, currently Dan Duncan LLC, to transfer its equity
interests in our general partner to a third party.  The new equity owner of our general partner would then be in a position to replace
the Board and officers of our general partner with their own choices and to influence the decisions taken by the Board and officers
of our general partner.
50
Table of Contents
We do not have the same flexibility as other types of organizations to accumulate cash and issue equity to protect against illiquidity
in the future.
Unlike a corporation, our partnership agreement requires us to make quarterly distributions to our unitholders of all available cash,
after taking into account reserves for commitments and contingencies, including capital and operating costs and debt service
requirements.  The value of our common units and other limited partner interests may decrease in correlation with any reduction in
our cash distributions per unit.  Accordingly, if we experience a liquidity problem in the future, we may not be able to issue more
equity to recapitalize.
Tax Risks to Common Unitholders
Our tax treatment depends on our status as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, as well as our not being subject to a
material amount of entity-level taxation by individual states.  If the Internal Revenue Service were to treat us as a corporation for
federal income tax purposes or if we were otherwise subject to a material amount of entity-level taxation, then cash available for
distribution to our unitholders would be reduced.
The anticipated after-tax economic benefit of an investment in our common units depends largely on our being treated as a
partnership for federal income tax purposes.  Despite the fact that we are organized as a limited partnership under Delaware law, we
will be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes unless we satisfy a “qualifying income” requirement. Based on our
current operations, we believe we satisfy the qualifying income requirement.  Failing to meet the qualifying income requirement or
a change in current law could cause us to be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes or otherwise subject us to
taxation as an entity.  We have not requested, and do not plan to request, a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) with
respect to our classification as a partnership for federal income tax purposes.
If we were treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, we would pay federal income tax on our taxable income at the
corporate tax rate and we would also likely pay additional state and local income taxes at varying rates.  Distributions to our
unitholders would generally be taxed again as corporate dividends, and no income, gains, losses or deductions would flow through
to our unitholders.  Because a tax would be imposed upon us as a corporation, the cash available for distribution to our unitholders
would be reduced.  Thus, treatment of us as a corporation could result in a reduction in the anticipated cash-flow and after-tax
return to our unitholders, which would cause a reduction in the value of our common units.
At the state level, several states have been evaluating ways to subject partnerships to entity-level taxation through the imposition of
state income, franchise, capital, and other forms of business taxes, as well as subjecting nonresident partners to taxation through the
imposition of withholding obligations and composite, combined, group, block, or similar filing obligations on nonresident partners
receiving a distributive share of state “sourced” income. We currently own property or do business in a substantial number of states.
Imposition on us of any of these taxes in jurisdictions in which we own assets or conduct business or an increase in the existing tax
rates could result in a reduction in the anticipated cash-flow and after-tax return to our unitholders, which would cause a reduction
in the value of our common units.
From 2013 through 2017, several publicly traded partnerships merged into their corporate general partner sponsors.  In 2018 and
continuing into 2022, the combination of a number of additional factors, including the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the
“Tax Act”) of 2017 (which lowered the federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% and generally provides for the expensing of
certain capital investments and acquisitions), the FERC issuing its Revised Policy Statement on the Treatment of Income Taxes in
March 2018, and, generally, continued lower demand and related liquidity for midstream energy companies (including those
structured as publicly traded partnerships), led to additional publicly traded partnerships to either (i) merge into their corporate
general partner sponsors, (ii) merge into their general partner structured as a partnership and then elect for the combined entity to be
taxed as a corporation, or (iii) voluntarily elect to be taxed as a corporation.  These conversions have materially reduced the number
of publicly traded partnerships and the total market capitalization and the depth of capital available for the publicly traded
partnership sector.
 
51
Table of Contents
While we currently believe that our classification as a partnership for federal income tax purposes continues to provide  a net
benefit for our unitholders, should we continue to see (i) additional publicly traded partnerships elect to be taxed as corporations,
which could result in a further decrease in the total market capitalization of the publicly traded partnership sector, (ii) lower demand
for equity capital in the publicly traded partnership sector, (iii) the absence of a historic premium in the market valuation of
publicly traded partnerships compared to midstream energy companies taxed as corporations  (or if we see any discount in the
valuation of our partnership compared to such companies), or (iv) a combination thereof that results in a material difference in our
cost of capital or limits our access to capital, the board of directors of our general partner may determine it is in our unitholders’
best interest to change our classification as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. Should the general partner recommend
that we change our tax classification, such change would be subject to the approval of our common unitholders.
The tax treatment of publicly traded partnerships or an investment in our common units could be subject to potential legislative,
judicial or administrative changes and differing interpretations, possibly on a retroactive basis.
The present federal income tax treatment of publicly traded partnerships, including us, or an investment in our common units, may
be modified by administrative, legislative or judicial interpretation.  From time to time, members of Congress propose and consider
substantive changes to the existing federal income tax laws that affect publicly traded partnerships or an investment in our common
units, including elimination of partnership tax treatment for certain publicly traded partnerships.
Any changes to federal income tax laws and interpretations thereof (including administrative guidance relating to the Tax Act) may
or may not be applied retroactively and could make it more difficult or impossible for us to be treated as a partnership for federal
income tax purposes or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.  Any such changes or
interpretations thereof could adversely impact the value of an investment in our common units.
We prorate our items of income, gain, loss and deduction between transferors and transferees of our common units each month
based upon the ownership of our common units on the first day of each month, instead of on the basis of the date a particular
common unit is transferred.
We generally prorate our items of income, gain, loss and deduction between transferors and transferees of our common units each
month based upon the ownership of the units on the first day of each month, instead of on the basis of the date a particular unit is
transferred. Treasury Regulations allow a similar monthly simplifying convention, but such regulations do not specifically
authorize all aspects of our proration method.  If the IRS were to successfully challenge our proration method, we may be required
to change the allocation of items of income, gain, loss and deduction among our unitholders.
A successful IRS contest of the federal income tax positions we take may adversely impact the market for our common units and the
cost of any IRS contest will reduce our cash available for distribution to unitholders.
The IRS has made no determination as to our status as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.  The IRS may adopt
positions that differ from the positions we take, even positions taken with advice of counsel.  It may be necessary to resort to
administrative or court proceedings to sustain some or all of the positions we take and such positions may not ultimately be
sustained.  A court may not agree with some or all of the positions we take.  As a result, any such contest with the IRS may
materially and adversely impact the market for our common units and the price at which our common units trade.  In addition, our
costs of any contest with the IRS, principally legal, accounting and related fees, will be indirectly borne by our unitholders because
the costs will reduce our cash available for distribution.
If the IRS makes audit adjustments to our income tax returns, it (and some states) may assess and collect any taxes (including any
applicable penalties and interest) resulting from such audit adjustment directly from us, in which case we would pay the taxes
directly to the IRS.  If we bear such payment, our cash available for distribution to our unitholders might be substantially reduced.
Under current law, for open tax years, if the IRS makes audit adjustments to our income tax returns, it (and some states) may assess
and collect any taxes (including any applicable penalties and interest) resulting from such audit adjustment directly from us.  Our
general partner would cause us to pay the taxes (including any applicable penalties and interest) directly to the IRS.  As a result, our
current unitholders may bear some or all of the tax liability resulting from such audit adjustment, even if such unitholders did not
own common units in us during the tax year under audit.  If, as a result of any such audit adjustment, we are required to make
payments of taxes, penalties and interest, our cash available for distribution to our unitholders might be substantially reduced.
52
Table of Contents
Our unitholders may be required to pay taxes on their share of our income even if they do not receive any cash distributions from
us.
Because our unitholders will be treated as partners to whom we will allocate taxable income which could be different in amount
from the cash that we distribute, our unitholders may be required to pay federal income taxes and, in some cases, state and local
income taxes on their share of our taxable income, whether or not they receive any cash distributions from us.  Our common
unitholders may not receive cash distributions from us equal to their share of our taxable income or even equal to the actual tax
liability resulting from their share of our taxable income.
Tax gains or losses on the disposition of our common units could be more or less than expected.
If our unitholders sell their common units, they will recognize a gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized
and their tax basis in those common units.  Because distributions in excess of a unitholder’s allocable share of our net taxable
income decrease the unitholder’s tax basis in the unitholder’s common units, the amount, if any, of such prior excess distributions
with respect to the common units a unitholder sells will, in effect, become taxable income to the unitholder if the unitholder sells
such common units at a price greater than the unitholder’s tax basis in those common units, even if the price received is less than
the unitholder’s original cost.  A substantial portion of the amount realized, whether or not representing gain, may be taxed as
ordinary income due to potential recapture items such as depreciation.  In addition, because the amount realized may include a
unitholder’s share of our nonrecourse liabilities, a unitholder that sells common units may incur a tax liability in excess of the
amount of the cash received from the sale.
Unitholders may be subject to limitation on their ability to deduct interest expense incurred by us.
Our ability to deduct interest paid or accrued on indebtedness properly allocable to a trade or business (“business interest”) may be
limited in certain circumstances. Should our ability to deduct business interest be limited, the amount of taxable income allocated to
our unitholders in the taxable year in which the limitation is in effect may increase. However, in certain circumstances, a unitholder
may be able to utilize a portion of a business interest deduction subject to this limitation in future taxable years. Prospective
unitholders should consult their tax advisors regarding the impact of this business interest deduction limitation on an investment in
our common units.
Tax-exempt entities face unique tax issues from owning our common units that may result in adverse tax consequences to them.
Investments in our common units by tax-exempt entities, such as individual retirement accounts (“IRAs”) or other retirement plans,
and non-U.S. persons raise issues unique to them.  For example, virtually all of our income allocated to unitholders who are
organizations exempt from federal income tax, including IRAs and other retirement plans, will be unrelated business taxable
income and will be taxable to them.  With respect to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, subject to the proposed
aggregation rules for certain similarly situated businesses or activities issued by the Treasury Department, a tax-exempt entity with
more than one unrelated trade or business (including by attribution from investment in a partnership such as ours) is required to
compute the unrelated business taxable income of such tax-exempt entity separately with respect to each such trade or business
(including for purposes of determining any net operating loss deduction).  As a result, for years beginning after December 31, 2017,
it may not be possible for tax-exempt entities to utilize losses from an investment in our partnership to offset unrelated business
taxable income from another unrelated trade or business and vice versa.  Tax-exempt entities should consult a tax advisor regarding
the impact of these rules on an investment in our common units. 
Non-U.S. unitholders will be subject to U.S. taxes and withholding with respect to their income and gain from owning our common
units.
Non-U.S. unitholders are generally taxed and subject to income tax filing requirements by the United States on income effectively
connected with a U.S. trade or business (“effectively connected income”).  Income allocated to our unitholders and any gain from
the sale of our common units will generally be considered to be “effectively connected” with a U.S. trade or business.  As a result,
distributions to a non-U.S. unitholder will be subject to withholding at the highest applicable effective tax rate and a non-U.S.
unitholder who sells or otherwise disposes of a common unit will also be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the gain realized
from the sale or disposition of that common unit.
53
Table of Contents
Moreover, upon the sale, exchange or other disposition of a common unit by a non-U.S. unitholder, the transferee is generally
required to withhold 10% of the amount realized on such sale, exchange or other disposition if any portion of the gain on such sale,
exchange or other disposition would be treated as effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business.  The U.S. Department of the
Treasury and the IRS have issued final regulations providing guidance on the application of these rules for transfers of certain
publicly traded partnership interests, including transfers of our common units.  Under these regulations, the “amount realized” on a
transfer of our common units will generally be the amount of gross proceeds paid to the broker effecting the applicable transfer on
behalf of the transferor, and such broker will generally be responsible for the relevant withholding obligations.  The U.S.
Department of the Treasury and the IRS have provided that these rules generally apply to transfers of and distributions on our
common units occurring on or after January 1, 2023.  Distributions to non-U.S. unitholders may also be subject to additional
withholding under these rules to the extent a portion of a distribution is attributable to an amount in excess of our cumulative net
income that has not previously been distributed.  We currently anticipate all of our distributions will be in excess of the amount of
our cumulative net income that has not previously been distributed.  Accordingly, a distribution to a non-U.S. unitholder is expected
to be subject to withholding at the highest applicable effective tax rate. Under these final regulations, we are required to issue
qualified notices regarding these matters. Our qualified notices can be found on our public company website.  Non-U.S. unitholders
should consult their tax advisors regarding the impact of these rules on an investment in our common units.
We treat each purchaser of our common units as having the same tax benefits without regard to the common units purchased.  The
IRS may challenge this treatment, which could adversely affect the value of our common units.
Because we cannot match transferors and transferees of common units, we adopt depreciation and amortization positions that may
not conform to all aspects of existing Treasury Regulations.  A successful IRS challenge to those positions could adversely affect
the amount of tax benefits available to a common unitholder.  It also could affect the timing of these tax benefits or the amount of
gain from a sale of common units and could have a negative impact on the value of our common units or result in audit adjustments
to the unitholder’s tax returns.
Our common unitholders will likely be subject to state and local taxes and return filing requirements in states where they do not
live as a result of an investment in our common units.
In addition to federal income taxes, our common unitholders will likely be subject to other taxes, such as state and local income
taxes, unincorporated business taxes and estate, inheritance or intangible taxes imposed by the various jurisdictions in which we do
business or own property now or in the future, even if the unitholder does not live in any of those jurisdictions.  Our common
unitholders will likely be required to file state and local income tax returns and pay state and local income taxes in some or all of
these various jurisdictions.  Further, our unitholders may be subject to penalties for failure to comply with those requirements.  We
currently own property or conduct business in a substantial number of states, many of which impose an income tax on individuals,
corporations and other entities.  As we make acquisitions or expand our business, we may control assets or conduct business in
additional states that impose a personal or corporate income tax.  It is the responsibility of each unitholder to file its own federal,
state and local tax returns, as applicable.
A unitholder whose common units are the subject of a securities loan (e.g., a loan to a “short seller” to cover a short sale of
common units) may be considered as having disposed of those common units.  If so, the unitholder would no longer be treated for
tax purposes as a partner with respect to those common units during the period of the loan and may recognize gain or loss from the
disposition.
Because there are no specific rules governing the U.S. federal income tax consequence of loaning a partnership interest, a
unitholder whose common units are the subject of a securities loan may be considered to have disposed of the loaned units.  In that
case, the unitholder may no longer be treated for tax purposes as a partner with respect to those common units during the period of
the loan and the unitholder may recognize gain or loss from such disposition.  Moreover, during the period of the loan, any of our
income, gain, loss or deduction with respect to those common units may not be reportable by the unitholder and any cash
distributions received by the unitholder as to those common units could be fully taxable as ordinary income.  Unitholders desiring
to assure their status as partners and avoid the risk of gain recognition from a securities loan are urged to consult a tax advisor to
determine whether it is advisable to modify any applicable brokerage account agreements to prohibit their brokers from lending
their common units.
54
Table of Contents
We have adopted certain valuation methodologies in determining a unitholder’s allocations of income, gain, loss and deduction. 
The IRS may challenge these methods or the resulting allocations and such a challenge could adversely affect the value of our
common units.
In determining the items of income, gain, loss and deduction allocable to our unitholders, we must routinely determine the fair
market value of our respective assets.  Although we may from time to time consult with professional appraisers regarding valuation
matters, we make fair market value estimates using a methodology based on the market value of our common units as a means to
measure the fair market value of our respective assets.  The IRS may challenge these valuation methods and the resulting
allocations of income, gain, loss and deduction.
A successful IRS challenge to these methods or allocations could adversely affect the amount, character and timing of taxable
income or loss being allocated to our unitholders.  It also could affect the amount of gain from our unitholders’ sale of common
units and could have a negative impact on the value of the common units or result in audit adjustments to our unitholders’ tax
returns without the benefit of additional deductions.
ITEM 1B.  UNRESOLVED SEC STAFF COMMENTS.
None.
ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.
We may be named as defendants in legal proceedings in connection with our normal business activities.  Although we are insured
against various risks to the extent we believe it is prudent, there is no assurance that the nature and amount of such insurance will
be adequate, in every case, to fully indemnify us against losses arising from legal proceedings.  We will vigorously defend our
partnership in litigation matters.
For additional information regarding litigation matters, see Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included
under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report.
On occasion, we are assessed monetary penalties by governmental authorities related to administrative or judicial proceedings
involving environmental matters.  The following information summarizes matters where the eventual resolution of each of these
matters may result in monetary sanctions in excess of $0.3 million.  We do not expect that any expenditures related to the following
matters will be material to our consolidated financial statements.
•In June 2019, we received a Notice of Violation from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) in connection
with regulatory requirements applicable to facilities that we operate in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.
•In July 2021, we received a civil penalty demand from the U.S. Department of Justice and the State of Colorado regarding
alleged violations of hydrocarbon leak detection and repair regulations applicable to our Meeker gas processing plant in
Colorado.  
•In August 2022, we received a Notice of Violation from the U.S. EPA alleging that gasoline at two of our refined products
terminals in Texas had exceeded certain Clean Air Act-related standards during two past regulatory control periods.
•In August 2022, we received two Notices of Enforcement from the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality for
alleged exceedances of air permit emission limits at our PDH 1 and iBDH facilities in Texas.

ITEM 5.  MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED UNITHOLDER MATTERS
AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES
Our common units are listed on the NYSE under the ticker symbol EPD.  As of January 31, 2023, there were approximately 1,896
unitholders of record of our common units.  For information regarding our quarterly cash distributions to partners, see Note 8 of the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report.
Recent Issuances of Unregistered Securities
Holders of our Series A Cumulative Convertible Preferred Units (“preferred units”) are entitled to receive cumulative quarterly
distributions at a rate of 7.25% per annum.  We may satisfy our obligation to pay distributions to the preferred unitholders through
the issuance, in whole or in part, of additional preferred units (referred to as paid-in-kind or “PIK” distributions), with the
remainder in cash, subject to certain rights of a holder to elect all cash and other conditions as described in our partnership
agreement.
The Partnership made quarterly PIK distributions of 16,823, 17,128, 17,438 and 17,754 preferred units to OTA Holdings, Inc.
(“OTA”), an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of the Partnership, in the first, second, third and fourth quarters of 2022,
respectively.  The preferred units held by OTA are accounted for as treasury units in consolidation.  For additional information
regarding the preferred units, see Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this
annual report.
The issuances of preferred units as PIK distributions during the year ended December 31, 2022 were undertaken in reliance upon an
exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) thereof.
Other than as described above, there were no sales of unregistered equity securities during the fourth quarter of 2022.

Overview of Business
We are a publicly traded Delaware limited partnership, the common units of which are listed on the New York Stock Exchange
(“NYSE”) under the ticker symbol “EPD.”  Our preferred units are not publicly traded.  We were formed in April 1998 to own and
operate certain natural gas liquids (“NGLs”) related businesses of EPCO and are a leading North American provider of midstream
energy services to producers and consumers of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil, petrochemicals and refined products.  We are owned
by our limited partners (preferred and common unitholders) from an economic perspective.   Enterprise GP, which owns a non-
economic general partner interest in us, manages our Partnership.  We conduct substantially all of our business operations through
EPO and its consolidated subsidiaries.
Our fully integrated, midstream energy asset network (or “value chain”) links producers of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil from
some of the largest supply basins in the U.S., Canada and the Gulf of Mexico with domestic consumers and international markets. 
Our midstream energy operations include:
•natural gas gathering, treating, processing, transportation and storage;
•NGL transportation, fractionation, storage, and marine terminals (including those used to export liquefied petroleum gases
(“LPG”) and ethane);
•crude oil gathering, transportation, storage, and marine terminals;
•propylene production facilities (including propane dehydrogenation (“PDH”) facilities), butane isomerization, octane
enhancement, isobutane dehydrogenation (“iBDH”) and high purity isobutylene (“HPIB”) production facilities;
•petrochemical and refined products transportation, storage, and marine terminals (including those used to export ethylene
and polymer grade propylene (“PGP”)); and
•a marine transportation business that operates on key U.S. inland and intracoastal waterway systems. 
The safe operation of our assets is a top priority.  We are committed to protecting the environment and the health and safety of the
public and those working on our behalf by conducting our business activities in a safe and environmentally responsible manner. 
For additional information, see “Regulatory Matters - Environmental, Safety and Conservation” within Part I, Items 1 and 2 of this
annual report.

Like many publicly traded partnerships, we have no employees.  All of our management, administrative and operating functions are
performed by employees of EPCO pursuant to an administrative services agreement (the “ASA”) or by other service providers.
Each of our business segments benefits from the supporting role of our marketing activities.  The main purpose of our marketing
activities is to support the utilization and expansion of assets across our midstream energy asset network by increasing the volumes
handled by such assets, which results in additional fee-based earnings for each business segment.  In performing these support
roles, our marketing activities also seek to participate in supply and demand opportunities as a supplemental source of segment
gross operating margin for us.  The financial results of our marketing efforts fluctuate due to changes in volumes handled and
overall market conditions, which are influenced by current and forward market prices for the products bought and sold.
Our financial position, results of operations and cash flows are subject to certain risks. For information regarding such risks, see
“Risk Factors” included under Part I, Item 1A of this annual report.
Current Outlook
As noted previously, this annual report on Form 10-K, including this update to our outlook on business conditions, contains
forward-looking statements that are based on our beliefs and those of Enterprise GP.  In addition, it reflects assumptions made by
us and information currently available to us, which includes forecast information published by third parties. See “Cautionary
Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information” within this Part II, Item 7 and “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A, for
additional information.  The following information presents our current views on key midstream energy supply and demand
fundamentals. All references to U.S. Energy Information Administration (“EIA”) forecasts and expectations are derived from its
February 2023 Short-Term Energy Outlook (“February 2023 STEO”), which was published on February 7, 2023.
The level of services we provide and the amount of volumes we purchase and sell are directly affected by changes in supply and
demand for hydrocarbon products, which impacts our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.  Beginning in the first
quarter of 2020, supply and demand for most hydrocarbon products were significantly reduced by the global effects of the COVID-
19 pandemic and the consequences of containment measures including quarantines, travel restrictions, temporary business closures
and similar protective actions.
Beginning in late 2020 and throughout 2021, most countries began to gradually reduce mobility restrictions to less stringent
methods of COVID-19 containment (e.g., vaccines, mask requirements and social distancing) allowing for the resumption of travel
and business activities.  These changes, coupled with strong fiscal and economic stimulus programs worldwide, helped bolster an
economic recovery in most industrial economies.  According to the EIA, U.S. gross domestic product (“GDP”) increased 5.9% in
2021 compared to a decrease of 2.8% in 2020.
In China, however, strategies for responding to the COVID-19 virus evolved through various stages that ultimately resulted in
longer-lasting mobility restrictions than in most other industrialized nations.  China adopted a strategy of “zero-COVID” which was
based on a strict testing regime intended to pinpoint and then isolate localized clusters of the population infected with the virus. 
The large-scale lockdowns dramatically slowed Chinese economic output between late 2021 and 2022 and ended up constricting
the global supply chain due to the significant reductions in intermediate and finished goods manufactured in China.  These
reductions occurred just as the rest of the world was demanding increases in goods upon emerging from the pandemic.
To make matters worse, Russia invaded the independent country of Ukraine in February 2022 in a major escalation of the conflict
that began when Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014.  To counter Russia’s aggression and to prevent a larger regional
conflict, members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (“NATO”), among other countries, imposed sanctions on Russia
including limits on exports of crude oil, refined products and natural gas, which sent global Brent crude oil prices soaring from $90
per barrel in early February 2022 to $123 per barrel by early June 2022.  Natural gas prices in Europe (based on the Dutch Title
Transfer Facility, a virtual trading hub for gas in the Netherlands and primary gas pricing hub for the European gas market)
increased even more dramatically from $26 per MMBtu in January 2022 to nearly $100 per MMBtu in August 2022.  The higher
cost of energy led to government subsidies and the rationing of natural gas, electricity and commodities in Europe, which further
reduced global economic output.

Several factors, including massive fiscal stimulus from the U.S. and other global governments, increases in energy prices due to
higher demand for energy and commodities following the pandemic, the significant global supply chain disruptions caused in large
part by lockdowns in China and the reduction in energy supplies due to sanctions on Russia contributed to inflation rates not seen in
the U.S. in over four decades.  Between June 2021 and June 2022, the inflation rate, as measured by the U.S. Consumer Price Index
(“CPI”), increased from 5.4% to a peak of 9.1%.  To counteract these pressures, the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank (“the Fed”)
increased interest rates by 25 basis points in March 2022 and 50 basis points in May 2022.  As inflation continued to rise, the Fed
further increased rates by 75 basis points in each of its June, July, September and November meetings during 2022.
Under the weight of these pressures, including higher interest rates, the U.S. economy began to experience a slowdown in growth
as evidenced by U.S. GDP decreasing 1.6% and 0.6% in the first and second quarters of 2022, respectively.  Some economists
labeled this period a recession based on the general indicator of two consecutive quarters of negative growth.  After peaking in June
2022 at 9.1%, the inflation rate slowly began to moderate in each of the subsequent months, declining to a rate of 6.5% in
December 2022.  In response to the decline in inflation, the Fed slowed the pace of interest rate increases to 50 basis points in
December 2022.  Despite these increases, U.S. GDP turned positive again with a growth rate of 3.2% in the third quarter of 2022
and 2.9% in the fourth quarter of 2022.
During the latter half of 2022, energy prices began falling to levels consistent with the start of the year as countries braced for
recession, lockdowns in China persisted, the U.S. and International Energy Agency member countries released an aggregate 240
million barrels from their respective strategic petroleum reserves and the U.S. and other non-OPEC countries increased petroleum
and other liquids production volumes by approximately 2.0 MMBPD during the second half of 2022 (as reported by the EIA). 
Energy prices in Europe fell to pre-war levels as a relatively warm winter and alternatives to Russian natural gas from the U.S.,
Qatar and other exporting nations led to a healthy buildup of storage inventories.  Despite sanctions and price caps, Russian crude
oil continued to find its way to refineries, albeit with redirected trade flows to China, India and other nations encouraged by the
ability to purchase crude oil from Russia at steep discounts.
The EIA provided expectations of continued growth in U.S. petroleum and liquid fuels production by nearly 1.0 MMBPD to reach
a total of 21.1 MMBPD in 2023.  Global production of petroleum and liquid fuels is expected to reach an average of 102.6
MMBPD in 2024, up from 100.0 MMBPD in 2022, driven mostly by growth in U.S. and other non-OPEC production.  With
respect to demand, the EIA forecasts that global liquids fuel consumption will increase from 99.4 MMBPD in 2022 to 102.3
MMBPD in 2024, driven primarily by growth from China and other non-OECD countries.  However, the EIA qualified that this
forecast is subject to significant uncertainty over Russia’s oil supply, ongoing concerns about global economic conditions and the
easing of COVID-19 restrictions in China.  We acknowledge that these uncertainties exist, however, the upside from the recently
more upbeat economic news and the continued reopening of the Chinese economy helps us remain constructive on crude oil prices. 
We are not as constructive on natural gas prices considering we see domestic production rising, consumption declining and
liquefied natural gas (“LNG”) exports remaining relatively flat until 2025 when additional capacity will be available from new
facilities that are expected to be placed in service.  A wider crude oil-to-natural gas price spread, however, makes U.S.
petrochemicals more cost-advantaged due to locally produced feedstocks more closely aligning with natural gas prices, whereas
feedstocks derived from naphtha are more closely aligned with crude oil prices.
We believe that these coming additions to petroleum production and consumption levels, along with favorable pricing trends, will
create additional opportunities to provide midstream services to our customers while leveraging the strengths of our portfolio,
which include:
•Our Assets – Our people find innovative ways to optimize our large, integrated and diversified asset base to provide
incremental services to customers and to respond to market opportunities.  Additional production volumes could lead to
higher demand for processing, transportation, fractionation and terminaling services.  Storage services provide valuable
flexibility for customers seeking to balance supply and demand while also allowing us to capture valuable contango and
other marketing opportunities should they arise.  U.S. energy and feedstock advantages position our assets well to compete
globally for incremental production and processing volumes.  To the extent a rising operating cost environment impacts
our results, there are typically offsetting benefits either inherent in our business or that result from other steps we take
proactively to reduce the impact of inflation on our operating results.  These steps include revenue rate escalations based
on inflation factors, fuel and electricity surcharges and additional volumetric throughputs often achieved during periods of
higher prices.

•Our Customers – We have contracted with a large number of quality customers in order to achieve revenue
diversification.  In 2022, our top 200 largest customers represented 95.3% of consolidated revenues.  Based on their
respective year-end 2022 debt ratings, 89.6% of revenues from our top 200 customers were either investment grade rated
or backed by letters of credit.  Additionally, less than 4% of our top 200 customer revenues were attributable to sub-
investment grade or non-rated upstream producers.
•Our Balance Sheet and Liquidity – We currently maintain investment grade credit ratings on EPO’s long-term senior
unsecured debt of BBB+, Baa1 and BBB+ from Standard and Poor’s, Moody’s and Fitch, respectively.  Based on current
market conditions, we believe that we have sufficient consolidated liquidity as of December 31, 2022, which was
comprised of $4.0 billion of available borrowing capacity under EPO’s revolving credit facilities and $76 million of
unrestricted cash on hand.  As of December 31, 2022,  approximately 96.2% of our debt portfolio is fixed rate debt at a
weighted average cost of 4.5% and weighted-average maturity of 20 years.
•Our Access to Capital Markets – EPO successfully issued $1.75 billion in principal amount of senior notes in January
2023.  Based on current conditions, we believe that we will have sufficient liquidity and/or access to debt capital markets
to fund our operations, capital investments and the remaining principal amount of senior notes maturing through 2023 and
beyond.
Recent Developments
Enterprise’s SPOT Project Receives Record of Decision
In November 2022, we announced that our Sea Port Oil Terminal (“SPOT”) project received a favorable Record of Decision
(“ROD”) from the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Maritime Administration in accordance with the provisions of the
Deepwater Port Act of 1974.
The proposed SPOT project consists of onshore and offshore facilities, including a fixed platform located approximately 30
nautical miles off the Texas coast in approximately 115 feet of water.  SPOT is designed to load VLCCs and other crude oil tankers
at rates of approximately 85,000 barrels per hour.  The platform will be connected to an onshore storage facility with approximately
4.8 MMBbls of capacity in Brazoria County, Texas, by two 36-inch, bi-directional pipelines.  Additionally, the SPOT project
includes state-of-the-art pipeline control, vapor recovery and leak detection systems that are designed to minimize emissions.
The receipt of the ROD is a significant milestone in the process to obtain a license for SPOT under the Deepwater Port Act. 
Remaining conditions that we must address and satisfy to obtain approval for the license issuance include routine construction,
operating and decommissioning guarantees, submission of public outreach, wetland restoration and volatile organic compound
(“VOC”) monitoring plans, and other state approvals.  We expect to satisfy these remaining conditions in 2023; however, we can
give no assurance as to when or whether the project will ultimately be authorized to begin construction or operation.
Enterprise Announces Three Expansions in the Permian Basin
In August 2022, we announced the following three new projects to support ongoing production growth in the Permian Basin
(including their respective scheduled completion dates):
•our Leonidas natural gas processing plant, which was previously referred to as Plant 7, in the Midland Basin (first quarter of
2024);
•our Mentone III natural gas processing plant in the Delaware Basin (first quarter of 2024); and
•a 275 MBPD expansion of our Shin Oak NGL Pipeline (first half of 2025).

Enterprise and OLCV Sign Letter of Intent for Gulf Coast CO2 Transportation and Sequestration Project
In April 2022, Enterprise and Oxy Low Carbon Ventures, LLC (“OLCV”), a subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum Corporation,
announced that we have executed a letter of intent to work toward a potential carbon dioxide (“CO2”) transportation and
sequestration solution for the Texas Gulf Coast.  The joint project would initially be focused on providing services to emitters in the
industrial corridors from the greater Houston to Beaumont/Port Arthur areas.  The initiative would combine Enterprise’s leadership
position in the midstream energy sector with OLCV’s extensive experience in subsurface characterization and CO2 sequestration.
Enterprise would develop the CO2 aggregation and transportation network utilizing a combination of new and existing pipelines
along its expansive Gulf Coast footprint. OLCV, through its 1PointFive business unit, is developing sequestration hubs on the Gulf
Coast and across the U.S., some of which are expected to be anchored by direct air capture facilities. The hubs will provide access
to high quality pore space and efficient transportation infrastructure, bringing more options to emitters looking to explore viable
carbon management strategies.  Enterprise and OLCV have begun exploring the commercialization of the potential joint service
offering with customers.
Enterprise Announces Seven New Projects During Analyst and Investor Day
On April 12, 2022, Enterprise hosted a meeting with securities analysts and investors where we announced seven new projects that
we expect will be completed by 2025.  The announced projects included the following (including their respective scheduled
completion dates):
•a 400 MMcf/d expansion of our Acadian Gas System (second quarter of 2023);
•our Poseidon natural gas processing plant, which was previously referred to as Plant 6, in the Midland Basin (third quarter of
2023);
•a twelfth NGL fractionator (“Frac XII”) in Chambers County, Texas (third quarter of 2023);
•our Mentone II natural gas processing plant in the Delaware Basin (fourth quarter of 2023);
•our Texas Western Products System, created by repurposing a portion of our Mid-America Pipeline System’s Rocky Mountain
segment and adding westbound service to our Chaparral Pipeline business to transport refined products from the U.S. Gulf
Coast to markets in West Texas, New Mexico, Colorado and Utah (fourth quarter of 2023);
•an Ethane Export Terminal located in Orange County, Texas (2025); and
•an expansion of our Morgan’s Point terminal to increase ethylene export capacity (2024 and 2025).
Enterprise Announces Acquisition of Navitas Midstream
In January 2022, we announced that an affiliate of Enterprise entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Navitas Midstream
Partners, LLC (“Navitas Midstream”) from an affiliate of Warburg Pincus LLC in a debt-free transaction for $3.25 billion in cash
consideration (subject to adjustment in accordance with the agreement). Navitas Midstream’s assets include approximately 1,750
miles of pipelines and over 1.0 Bcf/d of cryogenic natural gas processing capacity. The purchase price was paid in cash at closing
on February 17, 2022. We funded the cash consideration for this acquisition using proceeds from the issuance of short-term notes
under EPO’s commercial paper program and cash on hand.  See Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report for additional information regarding this acquisition.

Chambers County, Texas exceeds the value of the equivalent amount of energy in natural gas at Henry Hub, Louisiana. Our estimate of the indicative spread
does not consider the operating costs incurred by a natural gas processing facility to extract the NGLs nor the transportation and fractionation costs to deliver
the NGLs to market.   In addition, the actual gas processing spread earned at each plant is further influenced by regional pricing and extraction dynamics.
The weighted-average indicative market price for NGLs was $0.91 per gallon in 2022 versus $0.75 per gallon for 2021.

Fluctuations in our consolidated revenues and cost of sales amounts are explained in large part by changes in energy commodity
prices. An increase in our consolidated marketing revenues due to higher energy commodity sales prices may not result in an
increase in gross operating margin or cash available for distribution, since our consolidated cost of sales amounts would also be
expected to increase due to comparable increases in the purchase prices of the underlying energy commodities.  The same type of
relationship would be true in the case of lower energy commodity sales prices and purchase costs.
We attempt to mitigate commodity price exposure through our hedging activities and the use of fee-based arrangements.  See Note

hedging activities.
Impact of Inflation
After being relatively moderate in recent years, inflation in the United States increased significantly in late 2021 into 2022.  This
rise in inflation, coupled with supply chain disruptions, labor shortages and increased commodity prices, has generally resulted in
higher costs in 2022.  However, to the extent that a rising cost environment impacts our results, there are typically offsetting
benefits either inherent in our business or that result from other steps we take proactively to reduce the impact of inflation on our
net operating results.  These benefits include: (1) provisions included in our long-term fee-based revenue contracts that offset cost
increases in the form of rate escalations based on positive changes in the U.S. Consumer Price Index, Producer Price Index for
Finished Goods or other factors; (2) provisions in other revenue contracts that enable us to pass through higher energy costs to
customers in the form of gas, electricity and fuel rebills or surcharges; and (3) higher commodity prices, which generally enhance
our results in the form of increased volumetric throughput and demand for our services.  Additionally, we take measures to mitigate
the impact of cost increases in certain commodities, including a portion of our electricity needs, using fixed-price, term purchase
agreements.  For these reasons, the increased cost environment, caused in part by inflation, has not had a material impact on our
historical results of operations for the periods presented in this report.  However, a significant or prolonged period of high inflation
could adversely impact our results if costs were to increase at a rate greater than the increase in the revenues we receive.
See “Capital Investments” within this Part II, Item 7 for a discussion of the impact of inflation on our capital investment decisions. 
Additionally, see Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors - Changes in price levels could negatively impact our revenue, our expenses, or
both, which could adversely affect our business.”

Table of Contents
Total revenues for 2022 increased $17.4 billion when compared to 2021 primarily due to a $16.8 billion increase in marketing
revenues.
Revenues from the marketing of NGLs, crude oil and natural gas increased a combined $17.0 billion year-to-year primarily due to
higher average sales prices, which accounted for a $12.0 billion increase, and higher sales volumes, which accounted for an
additional $5.0 billion increase.
Revenues from midstream services for 2022 increased $593 million when compared to 2021.  Revenues from our natural gas
processing facilities increased $343 million year-to-year primarily due to higher market values for the equity NGL-equivalent
production volumes we receive as non-cash consideration for processing services.  Revenues from our natural gas pipeline assets
increased $251 million year-to-year primarily due to the addition of the Midland Basin Gathering System from the Navitas
Midstream acquisition and higher demand for natural gas transportation and gathering services in Texas and New Mexico. 
Revenues from our NGL fractionators increased $51 million year-to-year primarily due to higher fractionation fee revenues at our
Chambers County NGL fractionation complex.  Revenues from our ethylene export terminal increased $34 million year-to-year
primarily due to higher loading fee revenues. Lastly, revenues from our crude oil pipeline assets decreased $122 million year-to-
year primarily due to lower deficiency revenues as a result of the expiration of minimum volume commitments under certain long-
term gathering agreements on our EFS Midstream System.
For additional information regarding our revenues, see Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under
Part II, Item 8 of this annual report.
Operating costs and expenses
Total operating costs and expenses for 2022 increased $16.4 billion when compared to 2021.
Cost of sales
Cost of sales for 2022 increased $15.9 billion when compared to 2021.  The cost of sales associated with our marketing of NGLs,
crude oil and natural gas increased a combined $16.5 billion year-to-year primarily due to higher average purchase prices, which
accounted for a $12.1 billion increase, and higher sales volumes, which accounted for an additional $4.4 billion increase.
Other operating costs and expenses
Other operating costs and expenses increased $539 million year-to-year primarily due to higher utility, employee compensation and
rental costs.
Depreciation, amortization and accretion expenses
Depreciation, amortization and accretion expense increased $120 million year-to-year.  The addition of assets attributable to the
Navitas Midstream acquisition accounted for $86 million of the year-to-year increase.  The remainder of the year-to-year increase is
due to assets placed into full or limited service since the first quarter of 2021 (e.g., the Gillis Lateral natural gas pipeline and the
Baymark ethylene pipeline) and major maintenance activities accounted for under the deferral method.
Asset impairment charges
Non-cash asset impairment charges decreased $180 million year-to-year primarily due to the partial impairment of our marine
transportation business in December 2021, which accounted for $114 million of expense, and the sale of a coal bed natural gas
gathering system and related Val Verde treating facility in March 2021, both of which were components of our San Juan Gathering
System, which accounted for an additional $44 million of expense.  For information regarding these charges, see Note 4 of the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report.
General and administrative costs
General and administrative costs for 2022 increased $32 million when compared to 2021 primarily due to higher employee
compensation and professional services costs.
Equity in income of unconsolidated affiliates
Equity income from our unconsolidated affiliates for 2022 decreased $119 million when compared to 2021 primarily due to lower
earnings from investments in crude oil pipelines.

Table of Contents
Operating income
Operating income for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased $804 million when compared to the year ended December 31,
2021 due to the previously described year-to-year changes in revenues, operating costs and expenses, general and administrative
costs and equity in income of unconsolidated affiliates.
Interest expense
The following table presents the components of our consolidated interest expense for the years indicated (dollars in millions):
  For the Year Ended
December 31,  
  2022   2021  
Interest charged on debt principal outstanding (1)  $ 1,288  $ 1,299 
Impact of interest rate hedging program, including related amortization   19   38 
Interest costs capitalized in connection with construction projects (2)   (90)  (80)
Other (3)   27   26 
Total  $ 1,244  $ 1,283 
(1)The weighted-average interest rates on debt principal outstanding were 4.33% and 4.35% during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
(2)We capitalize interest costs incurred on funds used to construct property, plant and equipment while the asset is in its construction phase.  Capitalized interest
amounts become part of the historical cost of an asset and are charged to earnings (as a component of depreciation expense) on a straight-line basis over the
estimated useful life of the asset once the asset enters its intended service.  When capitalized interest is recorded, it reduces interest expense from what it
would be otherwise.  Capitalized interest amounts fluctuate based on the timing of when projects are placed into service, our capital investment levels and the
interest rates charged on borrowings.
(3)Primarily reflects facility commitment fees charged in connection with our revolving credit facilities and amortization of debt issuance costs.
Interest charged on debt principal outstanding, which is a key driver of interest expense, decreased $11 million year-to-year
primarily due to the retirement of $1.4 billion of fixed-rate senior notes in February 2022 and the redemption of $350 million of
variable-rate junior subordinated notes in August 2022 using a combination of available cash, commercial paper and proceeds from
a senior notes issuance in September 2021 with a lower interest rate.  These actions resulted in lower weighted-average interest
rates on outstanding debt obligations during the comparative years.  For information regarding our debt obligations, see Note 7 of
the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report.
Other, net
Other non-operating income for 2022 includes $16 million attributable to the partial recovery of attorneys’ fees related to the
settlement of the PDH 1 litigation in November 2022.  For additional information regarding this litigation, see Note 17 of the Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report.
Income taxes
Our provision for income taxes for 2022 increased $12 million when compared to 2021 primarily due to changes in income tax
expense related to state tax obligations under the Revised Texas Franchise Tax (“Texas Margin Tax”).
For information regarding our income taxes, see Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II,
Item 8 of this annual report.

Business Segment Highlights
Our operations are reported under four business segments: (i) NGL Pipelines & Services, (ii) Crude Oil Pipelines & Services, (iii)
Natural Gas Pipelines & Services and (iv) Petrochemical & Refined Products Services.  Our business segments are generally
organized and managed according to the types of services rendered (or technologies employed) and products produced and/or
sold.  
The following information summarizes the assets and operations of each business segment:
•Our NGL Pipelines & Services business segment includes our natural gas processing and related NGL marketing activities,
NGL pipelines, NGL fractionation facilities, NGL and related product storage facilities, and NGL marine terminals.
•Our Crude Oil Pipelines & Services business segment includes our crude oil pipelines, crude oil storage and marine terminals,
and related crude oil marketing activities.  
•Our Natural Gas Pipelines & Services business segment includes our natural gas pipeline systems that provide for the
gathering, treating and transportation of natural gas.  This segment also includes our natural gas marketing activities.
•Our Petrochemical & Refined Products Services business segment includes our (i) propylene production facilities, which
include propylene fractionation units and a PDH facility, and related pipelines and marketing activities, (ii) butane
isomerization complex and related deisobutanizer (“DIB”) operations, (iii) octane enhancement, iBDH and HPIB production
facilities, (iv) refined products pipelines, terminals and related marketing activities, (v) an ethylene export terminal and related
operations; and (vi) marine transportation business.
We evaluate segment performance based on our financial measure of gross operating margin.  Gross operating margin is an
important performance measure of the core profitability of our operations and forms the basis of our internal financial reporting. 
We believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that our management uses in evaluating
segment results. 
The following table presents gross operating margin by segment and total gross operating margin, a non-generally accepted
accounting principle (“non-GAAP”) financial measure, for the years indicated (dollars in millions):
  For the Year Ended
December 31,  
  2022   2021  
Gross operating margin by segment:       
   NGL Pipelines & Services  $ 5,142  $ 4,316 
   Crude Oil Pipelines & Services   1,655   1,680 
   Natural Gas Pipelines & Services   1,042   1,155 
   Petrochemical & Refined Products Services   1,517   1,357 
      Total segment gross operating margin (1)   9,356   8,508 
   Net adjustment for shipper make-up rights   (47)  53 
      Total gross operating margin (non-GAAP)  $ 9,309  $ 8,561 
(1)Within the context of this table, total segment gross operating margin represents a subtotal and corresponds to measures similarly titled within our business
segment disclosures found under Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report.
Total gross operating margin includes equity in the earnings of unconsolidated affiliates, but is exclusive of other income and
expense transactions, income taxes, the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles and extraordinary charges.  Total
gross operating margin is presented on a 100% basis before any allocation of earnings to noncontrolling interests.  Our calculation
of gross operating margin may or may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.  Segment gross
operating margin for NGL Pipelines & Services and Crude Oil Pipelines & Services reflect adjustments for shipper make-up rights
that are included in management’s evaluation of segment results.  However, these adjustments are excluded from non-GAAP total
gross operating margin.

The GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to total gross operating margin is operating income.  For a discussion of
operating income and its components, see the previous section titled “Income Statement Highlights” within this Part II, Item 7.  The
following table presents a reconciliation of operating income to total gross operating margin for the years indicated (dollars in
millions):

   Depreciation, amortization and accretion expense in operating costs and expenses (1)   2,107   2,011 
   Asset impairment charges in operating costs and expenses   53   233 
   Net losses attributable to asset sales and related matters in operating
costs and expenses   1   5 
   General and administrative costs   241   209 
Total gross operating margin (non-GAAP)  $ 9,309  $ 8,561 
(1)Excludes amortization of major maintenance costs for reaction-based plants, which are a component of gross operating margin.
Each of our business segments benefits from the supporting role of our marketing activities.  The main purpose of our marketing
activities is to support the utilization and expansion of assets across our midstream energy asset network by increasing the volumes
handled by such assets, which results in additional fee-based earnings for each business segment.  In performing these support
roles, our marketing activities also seek to participate in supply and demand opportunities as a supplemental source of gross
operating margin for us.  The financial results of our marketing efforts fluctuate due to changes in volumes handled and overall
market conditions, which are influenced by current and forward market prices for the products bought and sold.
Winter Storms Uri and Viola in 2021
Two major winter storms, Uri and Viola, impacted Texas and the southern U.S. in mid-February 2021 (the “February 2021 winter
storms”).  The storms had a major impact on the electric power grid in Texas, which resulted in widespread power outages. 
Voluntarily and in accordance with our agreements with the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, Inc. (“ERCOT”), we temporarily
shut down our non-essential plants and other operations in Texas to support residential power consumption. Those Texas assets that
remained operational (e.g., our natural gas processing plants, storage facilities and Texas Intrastate System) were impacted by
rolling blackouts.  During and following the storms, many of our customers also experienced downtime due to freeze-related
damage and repairs that impacted our volumes.  The economic impacts of these disruptions, higher power and natural gas costs, as
well as losses on natural gas hedges and lower volumes, were mitigated by sales of natural gas to electricity generators, natural gas
utilities and industrial customers to assist them in meeting their requirements.
Estimated Impact of Hurricane Ida on Results for 2021
In late August 2021, southern Louisiana and Mississippi, including its critical energy infrastructure, were impacted by the
cumulative effects of Hurricane Ida.  Impacts on the energy industry included, but were not limited to, severe flooding and limited
access to facilities, disruptions to offshore production in the Gulf of Mexico, and reduced energy demand from area refineries and
petrochemical facilities.  Our plant, pipeline and storage assets in southern Louisiana and Mississippi did not experience significant
property damage, and all assets have since returned to normal operations.  Our volumes impacted by third-party facility disruptions
also returned to normal levels as repairs were completed and production was fully restored.
We estimate that Hurricane Ida reduced our gross operating margin for the third and fourth quarters of 2021 by approximately $34
million, almost all of which was related to our Louisiana and Mississippi processing, transportation and fractionation assets and
related marketing activities, which are a component of our NGL Pipelines & Services segment.  Of this amount, approximately $29
million represents the combined net impact of lower than anticipated volumes and lost business opportunities.  The remaining $5
million represents expenses, net of property damage insurance reimbursements, which we incurred during the year in connection
with hurricane-related repair and recovery costs.

(2)Volumes reported correspond to the revenue streams earned by our natural gas processing plants.
(3)Fee-based natural gas processing volumes are measured at either the wellhead or plant inlet in MMcf/d.
Natural gas processing and related NGL marketing activities
Gross operating margin from natural gas processing and related NGL marketing activities for the year ended December 31, 2022
increased $811 million when compared to the year ended December 31, 2021.
Our Midland Basin natural gas processing facilities, which represent the natural gas processing facilities we acquired in February
2022 as part of our acquisition of Navitas Midstream, generated gross operating margin of $385 million.  Fee-based natural gas
processing volumes and equity NGL-equivalent production volumes at these facilities were 940 MMcf/d and 53 MBPD,
respectively, following the acquisition date.  Our Midland Basin natural gas gathering activities are discussed under the Natural Gas
Pipelines & Services segment.
Gross operating margin from our Delaware Basin natural gas processing facilities, which represent our legacy Permian Basin
processing facilities, increased $182 million year-to-year primarily due to higher average processing margins (including the impact
of hedging activities), which accounted for a $152 million increase, and a 180 MMcf/d increase in fee-based natural gas processing
volumes, which accounted for an additional $29 million increase.  Equity NGL-equivalent production volumes at these facilities
decreased 27 MBPD year-to-year.
Gross operating margin from our South Texas natural gas processing facilities increased $86 million year-to-year primarily due to
higher average processing margins (including the impact of hedging activities).  Fee-based natural gas processing volumes
increased 96 MMcf/d and equity NGL-equivalent production volumes decreased 1 MBPD year-to-year.
Gross operating margin from our Rockies natural gas processing facilities (Meeker, Pioneer and Chaco) increased a net $86 million
year-to-year primarily due to higher average processing margins (including the impact of hedging activities), which accounted for a
$71 million increase, and higher average processing fees, which accounted for an additional $20 million increase, partially offset by
an 8 MBPD combined decrease in equity NGL-equivalent production volumes, which accounted for a $10 million decrease.  On a
combined basis, fee-based natural gas processing volumes decreased 47 MMcf/d year-to-year.
Gross operating margin from our NGL marketing activities increased a net $71 million year-to-year primarily due to higher average
sales margins, which accounted for a $135 million increase, and an increase in sales volumes, which accounted for an additional
$29 million increase, partially offset by lower non-cash, mark-to-market earnings, which accounted for a $98 million decrease.  The
year-to-year increase in gross operating margin can be primarily attributed to results from marketing strategies that seek to optimize
our storage, plant and transportation assets.

to a 17 MBPD increase in transportation volumes. 
A number of our pipelines, including the Mid-America Pipeline System, Seminole NGL Pipeline, Chaparral NGL Pipeline, and
Shin Oak NGL Pipeline, serve Permian Basin and/or Rocky Mountain producers. On a combined basis, gross operating margin
from these pipelines decreased a net $79 million year-to-year primarily due to lower deficiency fees as a result of certain contracts
associated with the Rocky Mountain segment of our Mid-America Pipeline System reaching their termination date in September
2021, which accounted for a $71 million decrease, lower average transportation fees, which accounted for a $58 million decrease,
and higher utility and other operating costs, which accounted for an additional $31 million decrease, partially offset by a 120
MBPD (net to our interest) increase in transportation volumes, which accounted for an $88 million increase.
Gross operating margin from LPG-related activities at our Enterprise Hydrocarbons Terminal (“EHT”) decreased a net $67 million
year-to-year primarily due to lower average loading fees, which accounted for an $84 million decrease, and higher utility and other
operating costs, which accounted for an additional $9 million decrease, partially offset by a 54 MBPD increase in LPG export
volumes, which accounted for a $25 million increase.

to the year ended December 31, 2021.
Gross operating margin from our Chambers County NGL fractionation complex decreased a net $95 million year-to-year primarily
due to $63 million in margins earned on the optimization of our power supply arrangements and $40 million of payments received
in connection with our participation in the Texas Load Resources Demand Response Program (“LaaR”) during the second quarter
of 2021 in connection with the February 2021 winter storms.
Gross operating margin from our Chambers County NGL fractionation complex was further impacted by higher utility and other
operating costs, which accounted for an additional $50 million decrease, partially offset by a 53 MBPD (net to our interest) increase
in fractionation volumes, which accounted for a $54 million increase, and higher average fractionation fees, which accounted for an
additional $10 million increase. 
Gross operating margin from our Norco NGL fractionator increased $24 million year-to-year primarily due to a 12 MBPD increase
in fractionation volumes, which accounted for a $10 million increase, higher average fractionation fees, which accounted for an $8
million increase, and higher ancillary service revenues, which accounted for an additional $6 million increase.
Gross operating margin from our natural gasoline hydrotreater at our Chambers County complex, which was placed into service in
October 2021, increased $22 million year-to-year.

increased $43 million year-to-year primarily due to higher average sales margins, which accounted for a $50 million increase,
lower operating costs, which accounted for a $12 million increase, and higher earnings from trucking activities, which accounted
for an additional $10 million increase, partially offset by lower non-cash, mark-to-market earnings, which accounted for a $29
million decrease.
Gross operating margin from our Midland terminal increased $29 million year-to-year primarily due to higher ancillary service and
other revenues.
Gross operating margin from our South Texas Crude Oil Pipeline System increased a net $8 million year-to-year primarily due to
higher ancillary service and other revenues, which accounted for a $60 million increase, partially offset by lower average
transportation fees, which accounted for a $24 million decrease, and lower deficiency revenues as a result of the expiration of
minimum volume commitments under certain long-term agreements, which accounted for an additional $23 million decrease.
Gross operating margin from our Midland-to-ECHO System and related business activities increased a net $6 million year-to-year
primarily due to a 51 MBPD (net to our interest) increase in transportation volumes, which accounted for a $33 million increase,
higher other revenues, which accounted for an additional $17 million increase, partially offset by lower average sales margins,
which accounted for a $40 million decrease.

million when compared to the year ended December 31, 2021.
Gross operating margin from our natural gas marketing activities decreased $272 million year-to-year primarily due to lower
average sales margins. As noted previously, the year ended December 31, 2021 reflects increased natural gas sales as a result of our
efforts to meet the needs of electricity generators, natural gas utilities and industrial customers during the February 2021 winter
storms.
Gross operating margin from our Delaware Basin Gathering System, which represents our legacy Permian Basin gathering system,
decreased $49 million year-to-year primarily due to lower condensate sales.  Natural gas gathering volumes on our Delaware Basin
Gathering System increased 213 BBtus/d year-to-year.
Gross operating margin from our Texas Intrastate System increased $87 million year-to-year primarily due to higher average
transportation fees, which accounted for a $61 million increase, and higher ancillary and other revenues, which accounted for an
additional $31 million increase.  Transportation volumes on our Texas Intrastate System increased 449 BBtus/d year-to-year.
Our Midland Basin Gathering System, which represents the natural gas gathering system we acquired in February 2022 as part of
our acquisition of Navitas Midstream, generated gross operating margin of $52 million on gathering volumes of 1,273 BBtus/d
following the acquisition date.  Our Midland Basin natural gas processing activities are discussed under the NGL Pipelines &
Services segment.
On a combined basis, gross operating margin from our Jonah Gathering System, Piceance Basin Gathering System and San Juan
Gathering System in the Rocky Mountains increased a net $50 million year-to-year primarily due to higher average gathering fees,
which accounted for a $48 million increase, and higher condensate sales, which accounted for an additional $15 million increase,
partially offset by a 169 BBtus/d combined decrease in gathering volumes, which accounted for a $10 million decrease.
Gross operating margin from our Acadian Gas System and Haynesville Gathering System increased a combined $20 million year-
to-year primarily due to an 885 BBtus/d combined increase in transportation volumes.  The year-to-year increase in transportation
volumes is primarily due to the Gillis Lateral pipeline, which was placed into service in December 2021.

Propylene production and related activities
Gross operating margin from propylene production and related activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 decreased $234
million when compared to the year ended December 31, 2021.  Gross operating margin from our Chambers County propylene
production facilities decreased a combined net $218 million year-to-year primarily due to lower average propylene sales margins,
which accounted for a $150 million decrease, lower average processing fees, which accounted for a $90 million decrease, and
higher utility, amortization expense from major maintenance activities accounted for under the deferral method and other operating
costs, which accounted for an additional $67 million decrease, partially offset by an increase in propylene sales volumes, which
accounted for a $70 million increase, and higher by-product sales and other revenues, which accounted for an additional $19
million increase.  Propylene and associated by-product production volumes at these facilities increased a combined 3 MBPD year-
to-year (net to our interest).
Butane isomerization and related operations
Gross operating margin from butane isomerization and related operations increased $39 million year-to-year primarily due to an
increase in isomerization volumes, which accounted for a $22 million increase, and higher average isomerization fees, which
accounted for an additional $15 million increase.
Octane enhancement and related plant operations
Gross operating margin from our octane enhancement and related plant operations increased a net $287 million year-to-year
primarily due to higher average sales margins, which accounted for a $180 million increase, and an increase in sales volumes,
which accounted for an additional $151 million increase, partially offset by higher utility costs, amortization expense from major
maintenance activities accounted for under the deferral method and other operating costs, which accounted for a $41 million
decrease.  The year-to-year increase in sales volumes at these facilities is primarily due to planned major maintenance activities
during 2021, which were completed in the last week of January 2021 for our HPIB plant and the beginning of May 2021 for our
octane enhancement plant.

in transportation volumes, which accounted for a $13 million increase, and higher storage revenues, which accounted for an
additional $8 million increase.
Marine transportation and other services
Gross operating margin from marine transportation and other services increased $31 million year-to-year primarily due to higher
average fees and fleet utilization rates.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Based on current market conditions (as of the filing date of this annual report), we believe that the Partnership and its consolidated
businesses will have sufficient liquidity, cash flow from operations and access to capital markets to fund their capital investments
and working capital needs for the reasonably foreseeable future.  At December 31, 2022, we had $4.1 billion of consolidated
liquidity. This amount was comprised of $4.0 billion of available borrowing capacity under EPO’s revolving credit facilities, which
is the net of $4.5 billion of total borrowing capacity under EPO’s revolving credit facilities and $495 million outstanding under
EPO’s commercial paper program, and $76 million of unrestricted cash on hand.
We may issue debt and equity securities to assist us in meeting our future funding and liquidity requirements, including those
related to capital investments.  We have a universal shelf registration statement (the “2021 Shelf”) on file with the SEC that allows
the Partnership and EPO to issue an unlimited amount of equity and debt securities, respectively.

Cash Flow Statement Highlights
The following table summarizes our consolidated cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the years
indicated (dollars in millions).  
  For the Year Ended
December 31,  
  2022   2021  
Net cash flows provided by operating activities  $ 8,039  $ 8,513 
Cash used in investing activities   4,954   2,135 
Cash used in financing activities   5,844   4,571 
Net cash flows provided by operating activities are largely dependent on earnings from our consolidated business activities.
Changes in energy commodity prices may impact the demand for natural gas, NGLs, crude oil, petrochemicals and refined
products, which could impact sales of our products and the demand for our midstream services. Changes in demand for our
products and services may be caused by other factors, including prevailing economic conditions, reduced demand by consumers for
the end products made with hydrocarbon products, increased competition, public health emergencies, adverse weather conditions
and government regulations affecting prices and production levels.  We may also incur credit and price risk to the extent customers
do not fulfill their contractual obligations to us in connection with our marketing activities and long-term take-or-pay agreements.
For a more complete discussion of these and other risk factors pertinent to our business, see Part I, Item 1A of this annual report.
For additional information regarding our cash flow amounts, please refer to the Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows included
under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report.
The following information highlights significant year-to-year fluctuations in our consolidated cash flow amounts:
Operating activities
Net cash flows provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 decreased a net $474 million when
compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily due to:
•a $1.4 billion year-to-year decrease from changes in operating accounts primarily due to the use of working capital employed
in our marketing activities, which includes the impact of (i) fluctuations in commodity prices, (ii) timing of our inventory
purchase and sale strategies, and (iii) changes in margin deposit requirements associated with our commodity derivative
instruments; partially offset by
•a $1.0 billion year-to-year increase resulting from higher partnership earnings (determined by adjusting our $860 million
year-to-year increase in net income for changes in the non-cash items identified on our Statements of Consolidated Cash
Flows).
For information regarding significant year-to-year changes in our consolidated net income and underlying segment results, see
“Income Statement Highlights” and “Business Segment Highlights” within this Part II, Item 7.
Investing activities
Cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased a net $2.8 billion when compared to the year
ended December 31, 2021 primarily due to:
•a net $3.2 billion cash outflow in February 2022 in connection with the acquisition of Navitas Midstream; partially offset by
•a $259 million year-to-year decrease in investments for property, plant and equipment (see “Capital Investments” within this
Part II, Item 7 for additional information).
76
Table of Contents
Financing activities
Cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased $1.3 billion when compared to the year ended
December 31, 2021 primarily due to:
•a net cash outflow of $1.3 billion related to debt transactions that occurred during the year ended December 31, 2022
compared to a net cash outflow of $273 million related to debt transactions that occurred during the year ended December
31, 2021.  In 2022 we repaid $1.75 billion aggregate principal amount of senior and junior subordinated notes, partially
offset by net issuances of $495 million under EPO’s commercial paper program.  In 2021, we repaid $1.33 billion aggregate
principal amount of senior notes, partially offset by the issuance of $1.0 billion principal amount of senior notes; and
•a $165 million year-to-year increase in cash distributions paid to common unitholders primarily attributable to increases in
the quarterly cash distribution rate per unit.
Non-GAAP Cash Flow Measures
Distributable Cash Flow
Our partnership agreement requires us to make quarterly distributions to our common unitholders of all available cash, after any
cash reserves established by Enterprise GP in its sole discretion.  Cash reserves include those for the proper conduct of our
business, including those for capital investments, debt service, working capital, operating expenses, common unit repurchases,
commitments and contingencies and other amounts.  The retention of cash allows us to reinvest in our growth and reduce our future
reliance on the equity and debt capital markets.  
We measure available cash by reference to distributable cash flow (“DCF”), which is a non-GAAP cash flow measure.  DCF is an
important financial measure for our common unitholders since it serves as an indicator of our success in providing a cash return on
investment.  Specifically, this financial measure indicates to investors whether or not we are generating cash flows at a level that
can sustain our declared quarterly cash distributions.  DCF is also a quantitative standard used by the investment community with
respect to publicly traded partnerships since the value of a partnership unit is, in part, measured by its yield, which is based on the
amount of cash distributions a partnership can pay to a unitholder.  Our management compares the DCF we generate to the cash
distributions we expect to pay our common unitholders.  Using this metric, management computes our distribution coverage ratio.  
Our calculation of DCF may or may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.
Based on the level of available cash each quarter, management proposes a quarterly cash distribution rate to the Board, which has
sole authority in approving such matters.  Enterprise GP has a non-economic ownership interest in the Partnership and is not
entitled to receive any cash distributions from it based on incentive distribution rights or other equity interests.
Our use of DCF for the limited purposes described above and in this report is not a substitute for net cash flows provided by
operating activities, which is the most comparable GAAP measure to DCF. For a discussion of net cash flows provided by
operating activities, see “Cash Flow Statement Highlights” within this Part II, Item 7.

Capital Investments
We have approximately $5.8 billion of growth capital projects scheduled to be completed by the end of 2025 including the
following projects (including their respective scheduled completion dates):
•natural gas gathering expansion projects in the Delaware and Midland Basins (2023);
•our PDH 2 facility (second quarter of 2023);
•a 400 MMcf/d expansion of our Acadian Gas System (second quarter of 2023);
•our Poseidon natural gas processing plant in the Midland Basin (third quarter of 2023);
•a twelfth NGL fractionator (“Frac XII”) in Chambers County, Texas (third quarter of 2023);
•our Mentone II natural gas processing plant in the Delaware Basin (fourth quarter of 2023);
•our Texas Western Products System, created by repurposing a portion of our Mid-America Pipeline System’s Rocky Mountain
segment and adding westbound service to our Chaparral Pipeline business to transport refined products from the U.S. Gulf
Coast to markets in West Texas, New Mexico, Colorado and Utah (fourth quarter of 2023);
•our Mentone III natural gas processing plant in the Delaware Basin (first quarter of 2024);
•our Leonidas natural gas processing plant in the Midland Basin (first quarter of 2024);
•the expansion of our Shin Oak NGL Pipeline (first half of 2025);
•an Ethane Export Terminal located in Orange County, Texas (2025); and
•an expansion of our Morgan’s Point terminal to increase ethylene export capacity (2024 and 2025).
In February 2022, we acquired Navitas Midstream from an affiliate of Warburg Pincus LLC for $3.2 billion in net cash
consideration, which was funded using proceeds from the issuance of short-term notes under EPO’s commercial paper program and
cash on hand.  Shortly after closing on this transaction, we completed construction of the Leiker Plant and placed it into service in
March 2022.
Based on information currently available, we expect our total capital investments for 2023, net of contributions from noncontrolling
interests, to approximate $2.7 billion to $2.9 billion, which reflects growth capital investments of $2.3 billion to $2.5 billion and
sustaining capital expenditures of $400 million.  These amounts do not include capital investments associated with SPOT, our
proposed deep-water offshore crude oil terminal, which remains subject to state and federal permitting, mitigation and related
requirements.  We received a favorable ROD from the Department of Transportation’s Maritime Administration for SPOT during
the fourth quarter of 2022 and expect to satisfy the remaining conditions to obtain the deep-water port license in 2023; however, we
can give no assurance as to when or whether the project will ultimately be authorized to begin construction or operation.
Our forecast of capital investments is dependent upon our ability to generate the required funds from either operating cash flows or
other means, including borrowings under debt agreements, the issuance of additional equity and debt securities, and potential
divestitures.  We may revise our forecast of capital investments due to factors beyond our control, such as adverse economic
conditions, weather-related issues and changes in supplier prices resulting from raw material or labor shortages, supply chain
disruptions or inflation.  Furthermore, our forecast of capital investments may change over time based on future decisions by
management, which may include changing the scope or timing of projects or cancelling projects altogether.  Our success in raising
capital, having the ability to increase revenues commensurate with cost increases and our ability to partner with other companies to
share project costs and risks, continue to be significant factors in determining how much capital we can invest.  We believe our
access to capital resources is sufficient to meet the demands of our current and future growth needs and, although we currently
expect to make the forecast capital investments noted above, we may revise our plans in response to changes in economic and
capital market conditions.

(1)Growth and sustaining capital amounts presented in the table above are presented on a cash basis. In total, these amounts represent “Capital expenditures” as
presented on our Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows.
(2)Growth capital projects either (a) result in new sources of cash flow due to enhancements of or additions to existing assets (e.g., additional revenue streams,
cost savings resulting from debottlenecking of a facility, etc.) or (b) expand our asset base through construction of new facilities that will generate additional
revenue streams and cash flows.
(3)Sustaining capital projects are capital expenditures (as defined by GAAP) resulting from improvements to existing assets.  Such expenditures serve to
maintain existing operations but do not generate additional revenues or result in significant cost savings.  Sustaining capital expenditures include the costs of
major maintenance activities at our reaction-based plants, which are accounted for using the deferral method.
(4)Amount for the year ended December 31, 2022 represents net cash used for the acquisition of Navitas Midstream, which closed on February 17, 2022.
Comparison of Year Ended December 31, 2022 with Year Ended December 31, 2021
In total, investments in growth capital projects decreased a net $201 million year-to-year primarily due to the following:
•lower investments at our Chambers County complex (e.g., completion of our natural gasoline hydrotreater in October 2021
and a year-to-year decrease in spending on our PDH 2 facility, partially offset by a year-to-year increase in spending on Frac
XII), which accounted for a net $195 million decrease;
•completion of our Gillis Lateral natural gas pipeline in December 2021, which accounted for a $186 million decrease;
•completion of pipeline projects connecting our Chambers County complex with Gulf Coast assets, which accounted for a
$138 million decrease;
•lower investments in projects attributable to our ethylene business (e.g., completion of our Baymark ethylene pipeline in
November 2021), which accounted for a $99 million decrease; partially offset by
•higher investments in natural gas processing and gathering projects in the Permian Basin (e.g., construction of four natural gas
processing plants and related gathering systems), which accounted for a $289 million increase; and
•the purchase of approximately 580 miles of pipelines and related assets for $160 million during the fourth quarter of 2022. 
The purchase of these assets allow us to optimize and expand our NGL and petrochemical systems on the Gulf Coast.
Investments attributable to sustaining capital projects decreased $58 million year-to-year primarily due to lower major maintenance
activities performed at certain of our reaction-based plants (PDH 1, octane enhancement and HPIB facilities) and fluctuations in
timing and costs of pipeline integrity and similar projects.

Consolidated Debt
At December 31, 2022, the average maturity of EPO’s consolidated debt obligations was approximately 20.0 years.  The following
table presents the scheduled maturities of principal amounts of EPO’s consolidated debt obligations and associated estimated cash
payments for interest at December 31, 2022 for the years indicated (dollars in millions):

(1)Estimated cash payments for interest are based on the principal amount of our consolidated debt obligations outstanding at December 31, 2022, the
contractually scheduled maturities of such balances, and the applicable interest rates. Our estimated cash payments for interest are influenced by the long-term
maturities of our $2.3 billion in junior subordinated notes (due June 2067 through February 2078).  The estimated cash payments assume that (i) the junior
subordinated notes are not repaid prior to their respective maturity dates and (ii) the amount of interest paid on the junior subordinated notes is based on either
(a) the current fixed interest rate charged or (b) the weighted-average variable rate paid in 2022, as applicable, for each note through the respective maturity
date.
In February 2022, EPO repaid all of the $750 million and $650 million in principal amount of its Senior Notes VV and CC,
respectively, using remaining cash on hand attributable to its September 2021 senior notes offering and proceeds from issuances
under its commercial paper program.
In August 2022, EPO redeemed $350 million of the $700 million outstanding principal amount of its Junior Subordinated Notes D
at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes being redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon
to, but not including, the redemption date.  The redemption was funded using cash on hand and proceeds from issuances under
EPO’s commercial paper program.
In September 2022, EPO entered into a new $1.5 billion 364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement (the “September 2022 $1.5 Billion
364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement”) that replaced its September 2021 364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement.  The September
2022 $1.5 Billion 364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement matures in September 2023.  EPO’s borrowing capacity was unchanged
from the prior 364-day revolving credit agreement.  As of December 31, 2022, there are no principal amounts outstanding under
this new revolving credit agreement.
In January 2023, EPO issued $1.75 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes comprised of (i) $750 million principal
amount of senior notes due January 2026 (“Senior Notes FFF”) and (ii) $1.0 billion principal amount of senior notes due January
2033 (“Senior Notes GGG”).  Senior Notes FFF were issued at 99.893% of their principal amount and have a fixed-rate interest
rate of 5.05% per year.  Senior Notes GGG were issued at 99.803% of their principal amount and have a fixed-rate interest rate of
5.35% per year.  Net proceeds from this offering will be used by EPO for general company purposes, including for growth capital
investments, and the repayment of debt (including the repayment of all or a portion of our $1.25 billion principal amount of 3.35%
Senior Notes HH at their maturity in March 2023 and amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program).
For additional information regarding our consolidated debt obligations, see Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report.
Credit Ratings
As of February 28, 2023, the investment-grade credit ratings of EPO’s long-term senior unsecured debt securities were BBB+ from
Standard and Poor’s, Baa1 from Moody’s and BBB+ from Fitch Ratings.  In addition, the credit ratings of EPO’s short-term senior
unsecured debt securities were A-2 from Standard and Poor’s, P-2 from Moody’s and F-2 from Fitch Ratings.  EPO’s credit ratings
reflect only the view of a rating agency and should not be interpreted as a recommendation to buy, sell or hold any of our
securities.  A credit rating can be revised upward or downward or withdrawn at any time by a rating agency, if it determines that
circumstances warrant such a change.  A credit rating from one rating agency should be evaluated independently of credit ratings
from other rating agencies.

Enterprise Declares Cash Distribution for Fourth Quarter of 2022
On January 5, 2023, we announced that the Board declared a quarterly cash distribution of $0.49 per common unit, or $1.96 per
common unit on an annualized basis, to be paid to the Partnership’s common unitholders with respect to the fourth quarter of 2022. 
The quarterly distribution was paid on February 14, 2023 to unitholders of record as of the close of business on January 31, 2023. 
The total amount paid was $1.07 billion, which includes $9 million for distribution equivalent rights on phantom unit awards.
The payment of quarterly cash distributions is subject to management’s evaluation of our financial condition, results of operations
and cash flows in connection with such payments and Board approval.  Management will evaluate any future increases in cash
distributions on a quarterly basis.
Common Unit Repurchases Under 2019 Buyback Program
In January 2019, we announced that the Board had approved a $2.0 billion multi-year unit buyback program (the “2019 Buyback
Program”), which provides the Partnership with an additional method to return capital to investors. The 2019 Buyback Program
authorizes the Partnership to repurchase its common units from time to time, including through open market purchases and
negotiated transactions.  The timing and pace of buy backs under the program will be determined by a number of factors including
(i) our financial performance and flexibility, (ii) organic growth and acquisition opportunities with higher potential returns on
investment, (iii) the market price of the Partnership’s common units and implied cash flow yield and (iv) maintaining targeted
financial leverage, which is currently a debt-to-normalized adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization) ratio in the range of 2.75 to 3.25 times. No time limit has been set for completion of the 2019 Buyback Program, and
it may be suspended or discontinued at any time.
The Partnership repurchased an aggregate 10,166,923 common units under the 2019 Buyback Program through open market
purchases during the year ended December 31, 2022.  The total cost of these repurchases, including commissions and fees, was
$250 million.  Common units repurchased under the 2019 Buyback Program are immediately cancelled upon acquisition.  As of
December 31, 2022, the remaining available capacity under the 2019 Buyback Program was $1.3 billion.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
In our financial reporting processes, we employ methods, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of our financial statements.  These methods, estimates and
assumptions also affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for each reporting period.  Investors should be aware that
actual results could differ from these estimates if the underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect.  The following sections discuss
the use of estimates within our critical accounting policies:
82
Table of Contents
Valuation of Assets and Liabilities Acquired in a Business Combination
For acquisitions accounted for as business combinations, we allocate the purchase price of an acquired business to its identifiable
assets and liabilities based on estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the amount allocated to the acquired
identifiable assets and liabilities, if any, is recorded as goodwill.
Our purchase price allocation methodology contains uncertainties because it requires management to make assumptions and to
apply judgment to estimate the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities.  Management estimates the fair value of assets and
liabilities based upon quoted market prices, the carrying value of certain acquired assets and widely accepted valuation techniques,
including discounted cash flows.  Our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions we believe to be reasonable, but which
are inherently uncertain and unpredictable.  When appropriate, we engage third-party valuation specialists to assist in the fair value
determination of acquired tangible and intangible assets.  The purchase price allocation recorded in a business combination may
change during the measurement period, which is a period not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition, as additional
information about conditions existing at the acquisition date becomes available.
In February 2022, we acquired all of the member interests in Navitas Midstream Partners, LLC for $3.2 billion in net cash
consideration.  For information regarding this business combination, see Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report.
Depreciation Methods and Estimated Useful Lives of Property, Plant and Equipment
In general, depreciation is the systematic and rational allocation of an asset’s cost, less its residual value (if any), to the periods it
benefits.  The majority of our property, plant and equipment is depreciated using the straight-line method, which results in
depreciation expense being incurred evenly over the life of an asset. Depreciation expense incorporates management estimates
regarding the useful economic lives and residual values of our assets.  At the time we place our assets into service, we believe such
assumptions are reasonable; however, circumstances may develop that cause us to change these assumptions, which would change
our depreciation amounts prospectively.  Examples of such circumstances include (i) changes in laws and regulations that limit the
estimated economic life of an asset, (ii) changes in technology that render an asset obsolete, (iii) changes in expected salvage values
or (iv) significant changes in our forecast of the remaining life for the associated resource basins, if applicable.
At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the net carrying value of our property, plant and equipment was $44.4 billion and $42.1 billion,
respectively.  We recorded $1.8 billion and $1.7 billion of depreciation expense during the years ended December 31, 2022 and
2021, respectively.  For information regarding our property, plant and equipment, see Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report.
Measuring Recoverability of Long-Lived Assets and Fair Value of Equity Method Investments
Long-lived assets, which consist of intangible assets with finite useful lives and property, plant and equipment, are reviewed for
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. 
Examples of such events or changes might be production declines that are not replaced by new discoveries or long-term decreases
in the demand for or price of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil, petrochemicals or refined products.
The carrying value of a long-lived asset is deemed not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of undiscounted estimated cash flows
expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset.  Estimates of undiscounted cash flows are based on a number
of assumptions including anticipated operating margins and volumes; estimated useful life of the asset or asset group; and estimated
residual values.  If the carrying value of a long-lived asset is not recoverable, an impairment charge would be recorded for the
excess of the asset’s carrying value over its estimated fair value, which is derived from an analysis of the asset’s estimated future
discounted cash flows, the market value of similar assets and replacement cost of the asset less any applicable depreciation or
amortization.  In addition, fair value estimates also include the usage of probabilities when there is a range of possible outcomes.
83
Table of Contents
We evaluate our equity method investments for impairment when there are events or changes in circumstances that indicate there is
a potential loss in value of the investment attributable to an other-than-temporary decline.  Examples of such events or changes in
circumstances include continuing operating losses of the entity and/or long-term negative changes in the entity’s industry.  In the
event we determine that the value of an investment is not recoverable due to an other-than-temporary decline, we record a non-cash
impairment charge to adjust the carrying value of the investment to its estimated fair value.  We assess the fair value of our equity
method investments using commonly accepted techniques, and may use more than one method, including, but not limited to, recent
third party sales and discounted estimated cash flow models.  Estimates of discounted cash flows are based on a number of
assumptions including discount rates; probabilities assigned to different cash flow scenarios; anticipated margins and volumes and
estimated useful lives of the investment’s underlying assets.
A significant change in the assumptions we use to measure recoverability of long-lived assets and the fair value of equity method
investments could result in our recording a non-cash impairment charge. Any write-down of the carrying values of such assets
would increase operating costs and expenses at that time.
In 2022 and 2021, we recognized non-cash asset impairment charges attributable to assets other than goodwill totaling $53 million
and $233 million, respectively, which are a component of operating costs and expenses. For information regarding impairment
charges involving property, plant and equipment see Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part
II, Item 8 of this annual report.  We did not recognize any impairment charges in connection with our equity-method investments
during the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021.
Amortization Methods of Customer Relationships and Contract-Based Intangible Assets
The specific, identifiable intangible assets of an acquired business depend largely upon the nature of its operations and include
items such as customer relationships and contracts.
Customer relationship intangible assets represent the estimated economic value assigned to commercial relationships acquired in
connection with business combinations. In certain instances, the acquisition of these intangible assets provides us with access to
customers in a defined resource basin and is analogous to having a franchise in a particular area. Efficient operation of the acquired
assets (e.g., a natural gas gathering system) helps to support the commercial relationships with existing producers and provides us
with opportunities to establish new ones within our existing asset footprint.  The duration of this type of customer relationship is
limited by the estimated economic life of the associated resource basin that supports the customer group.  When estimating the
economic life of a resource basin, we consider a number of factors, including reserve estimates and the economic viability of
production and exploration activities.
In other situations, the acquisition of a customer relationship intangible asset provides us with access to customers whose
hydrocarbon volumes are not attributable to specific resource basins.  As with basin-specific customer relationships, efficient
operation of the associated assets (e.g., a marine terminal that handles volumes originating from multiple sources) helps to support
the commercial relationships with existing customers and provides us with opportunities to establish new ones. The duration of this
type of customer relationship is typically limited to the term of the underlying service contracts, including assumed renewals.
The value we assign to customer relationships is amortized to earnings using methods that closely resemble the pattern in which the
estimated economic benefits will be consumed (i.e., the manner in which the intangible asset is expected to contribute directly or
indirectly to our cash flows). For example, the amortization period for a basin-specific customer relationship asset is limited by the
estimated finite economic life of the associated hydrocarbon resource basin.
Contract-based intangible assets represent specific commercial rights we own arising from discrete contractual agreements. A
contract-based intangible asset with a finite life is amortized over its estimated economic life, which is the period over which the
contract is expected to contribute directly or indirectly to our cash flows.  Our estimates of the economic life of contract-based
intangible assets are based on a number of factors, including (i) the expected useful life of the related tangible assets (e.g., a marine
terminal, pipeline or other asset), (ii) any legal or regulatory developments that would impact such contractual rights and (iii) any
contractual provisions that enable us to renew or extend such arrangements.
84
Table of Contents
If our assumptions regarding the estimated economic life of an intangible asset were to change, then the amortization period for
such asset would be adjusted accordingly.  Changes in the estimated useful life of an intangible asset would impact operating costs
and expenses prospectively from the date of change.
At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the carrying value of our customer relationship and contract-based intangible asset portfolio was
$4.0 billion and $3.2 billion, respectively.  We recorded $177 million and $151 million of amortization expense attributable to
intangible assets during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.  For information regarding our intangible
assets, see Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report.
Methods We Employ to Measure the Fair Value of Goodwill and Related Assets
Our goodwill balance was $5.6 billion and $5.4 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.  Goodwill, which represents
the cost of an acquired business in excess of the fair value of its net assets at the acquisition date, is subject to annual impairment
testing in the fourth quarter of each year or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the
goodwill may not be recoverable.  Goodwill impairment charges represent the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying value
(including its respective goodwill) exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill.
We determine the fair value of each reporting unit using accepted valuation techniques, primarily through the use of discounted
cash flows (i.e., an income approach to fair value) supplemented by market-based assessments, if available.  The estimated fair
values of our reporting units incorporate assumptions regarding the future economic prospects of the assets and operations that
comprise each reporting unit including: (i) discrete financial forecasts for the assets comprising the reporting unit, which, in turn,
rely on management’s estimates of long-term operating margins, throughput volumes, capital investments and similar factors; (ii)
long-term growth rates for the reporting unit’s cash flows beyond the discrete forecast period; and (iii) appropriate discount rates. 
The fair value estimates are based on Level 3 inputs of the fair value hierarchy.  We believe that the assumptions we use in
estimating reporting unit fair values are consistent with those that market participants would use in their fair value estimation
process.  However, due to uncertainties in the estimation process and volatility in the supply and demand for hydrocarbons and
similar risk factors, actual results could differ significantly from our estimates.
We did not record any goodwill impairment charges during the year ended December 31, 2022.  Based on our most recent goodwill
impairment test at December 31, 2022, the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units was substantially in excess of its
carrying value (i.e., by at least 10%).
For information regarding our goodwill, see Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item
8 of this annual report.
Use of Estimates for Revenues and Expenses
As noted previously, preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates that
affect amounts presented in the financial statements.  Due to the time required to compile actual billing information and receive
third party data needed to record transactions, we routinely employ estimates in connection with revenue and expense amounts in
order to meet our accelerated financial reporting deadlines.
Our most significant routine estimates involve revenues and costs of certain natural gas processing facilities, pipeline transportation
revenues, fractionation revenues, marketing revenues and related purchases, and power and utility costs.  These types of
transactions must be estimated since the actual amounts are generally unavailable at the time we complete our accounting close
process. The estimates subsequently reverse in the next accounting period when the corresponding actual customer billing or
vendor-invoiced amounts are recorded.
Changes in facts and circumstances may result in revised estimates, which could affect our reported financial statements and
accompanying disclosures.  Prior to issuing our financial statements, we review our revenue and expense estimates based on
currently available information to determine if adjustments are required.

Other Matters
Parent-Subsidiary Guarantor Relationship
The Partnership (the “Parent Guarantor”) has guaranteed the payment of principal and interest on the consolidated debt obligations
of EPO (the “Subsidiary Issuer”), with the exception of the remaining debt obligations of TEPPCO Partners, L.P. (collectively, the
“Guaranteed Debt”).  If EPO were to default on any of its Guaranteed Debt, the Partnership would be responsible for full and
unconditional repayment of such obligations. At December 31, 2022, the total amount of Guaranteed Debt was $29.0 billion, which
was comprised of $25.8 billion of EPO’s senior notes, $2.3 billion of EPO’s junior subordinated notes, $495 million of short-term
commercial paper notes and $426 million of related accrued interest.
The Partnership’s guarantees of EPO’s senior note obligations, commercial paper notes and borrowings under bank credit facilities
represent unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the Partnership that rank equal in right of payment to all other existing or
future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of the Partnership. In addition, these guarantees effectively rank junior in right
of payment to any existing or future indebtedness of the Partnership that is secured and unsubordinated, to the extent of the assets
securing such indebtedness.
The Partnership’s guarantees of EPO’s junior subordinated notes represent unsecured and subordinated obligations of the
Partnership that rank equal in right of payment to all other existing or future subordinated indebtedness of the Partnership and
senior in right of payment to all existing or future equity securities of the Partnership. The Partnership’s guarantees of EPO’s junior
subordinated notes effectively rank junior in right of payment to (i) any existing or future indebtedness of the Partnership that is
secured, to the extent of the assets securing such indebtedness and (ii) all other existing or future unsecured and unsubordinated
indebtedness of the Partnership.
The Partnership may be released from its guarantee obligations only in connection with EPO’s exercise of its legal or covenant
defeasance options as described in the underlying agreements.
Selected Financial Information of Obligor Group
The following tables present summarized financial information of the Partnership (as Parent Guarantor) and EPO (as Subsidiary
Issuer) on a combined basis (collectively, the “Obligor Group”), after the elimination of intercompany balances and transactions
among the Obligor Group.
In accordance with Rule 13.01 of Regulation S-X, the summarized financial information of the Obligor Group excludes the Obligor
Group’s equity in income and investments in the consolidated subsidiaries of EPO that are not party to the guarantee obligations
(the “Non-Obligor Subsidiaries”).  The total carrying value of the Obligor Group’s investments in the Non-Obligor Subsidiaries
was $47.5 billion at December 31, 2022.  The Obligor Group’s equity in the earnings of the Non-Obligor Subsidiaries for the year
ended December 31, 2022 was $5.9 billion.  Although the net assets and earnings of the Non-Obligor Subsidiaries are not directly
available to the holders of the Guaranteed Debt to satisfy the repayment of such obligations, there are no significant restrictions on
the ability of the Non-Obligor Subsidiaries to pay distributions or make loans to EPO or the Partnership.  EPO exercises control
over the Non-Obligor Subsidiaries. We continue to believe that the consolidated financial statements of the Partnership presented
under Item 8 of this annual report provide a more appropriate view of our credit standing. Our investment grade credit ratings are
based on the Partnership’s consolidated financial statements and not the Obligor Group’s financial information presented below.

ITEM 7A.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES
ABOUT MARKET RISK.
General
In the normal course of our business operations, we are exposed to certain risks, including changes in interest rates and commodity
prices.  In order to manage risks associated with assets, liabilities and certain anticipated future transactions, we use derivative
instruments such as futures, forward contracts, swaps and other instruments with similar characteristics.  Substantially all of our
derivatives are used for non-trading activities.
We assess the risk associated with each of our derivative instrument portfolios using a sensitivity analysis model.  This approach
measures the change in fair value of the derivative instrument portfolio based on a hypothetical 10% change in the underlying
interest rates or quoted market prices on a particular day.  In addition to these variables, the fair value of each portfolio is
influenced by changes in the notional amounts of the instruments outstanding.  The sensitivity analysis approach does not reflect
the impact that the same hypothetical price movement would have on the hedged exposures to which they relate.  Therefore, the
impact on the fair value of a derivative instrument resulting from a change in interest rates or quoted market prices (as applicable)
would normally be offset by a corresponding gain or loss on the hedged debt instrument, inventory value or forecasted transaction
assuming:
•the derivative instrument functions effectively as a hedge of the underlying risk;
•the derivative instrument is not closed out in advance of its expected term; and
•the hedged forecasted transaction occurs within the expected time period.
We routinely review the effectiveness of our derivative instrument portfolios in light of current market conditions.  Accordingly, the
nature and volume of our derivative instruments may change depending on the specific exposure being managed.
See Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report for additional
information regarding our derivative instruments and hedging activities.
Commodity Hedging Activities
The price of energy commodities such as natural gas, NGLs, crude oil, petrochemicals and refined products are subject to
fluctuations in response to changes in supply and demand, market conditions and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our
control.  In order to manage such price risks, we enter into commodity derivative instruments such as physical forward contracts,
futures contracts, fixed-for-float swaps and basis swaps.
At December 31, 2022, our predominant commodity hedging strategies consisted of (i) hedging anticipated future purchases and
sales of commodity products associated with transportation, storage and blending activities, (ii) hedging the fair value of
commodity products held in inventory and (iii) hedging natural gas processing margins.  For a summary of our portfolio of
commodity derivative instruments outstanding, see Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part
II, Item 8 of this annual report.

Sensitivity Analysis
The following tables show the effect of hypothetical price movements on the estimated fair values of our principal commodity
derivative instrument portfolios at the dates indicated (dollars in millions).
The fair value information presented in the sensitivity analysis tables excludes the impact of applying Chicago Mercantile
Exchange (“CME”) Rule 814, which deems that financial instruments cleared by the CME are settled daily in connection with
variation margin payments.  As a result of this exchange rule, CME-related derivatives are considered to have no fair value at the
balance sheet date for financial reporting purposes; however, the derivatives remain outstanding and subject to future commodity
price fluctuations until they are settled in accordance with their contractual terms. Derivative transactions cleared on exchanges
other than the CME (e.g., the Intercontinental Exchange or ICE) continue to be reported on a gross basis.

Interest Rate Hedging Activities
We may utilize interest rate swaps, forward-starting swaps, options to enter into forward-starting swaps (“swaptions”), treasury
locks and similar derivative instruments to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates charged on borrowings under certain
consolidated debt agreements.  This strategy may be used in controlling our overall cost of capital associated with such borrowings.
As of the filing date of this annual report, we do not have any interest rate hedging derivative instruments outstanding.

MANAGEMENT’S ANNUAL REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL
OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2022
The management of Enterprise Products Partners L.P. and its consolidated subsidiaries, including its Co-Chief Executive Officer
and its Co-Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. 
Our internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to the management of Enterprise Products Partners L.P.
and the Board of Directors of its general partner regarding the preparation and fair presentation of Enterprise Products Partners
L.P.’s published financial statements.
Our management assessed the effectiveness of Enterprise Products Partners L.P.’s internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2022.  In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013).  This assessment
included a review of the design and operating effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting as well as the safeguarding
of assets.  Based on our assessment, we believe that, as of December 31, 2022, Enterprise Products Partners L.P.’s internal control
over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.
Our Audit and Conflicts Committee is comprised of independent directors who are not officers or employees of our general
partner.  This committee meets regularly with members of management, internal audit staff and representatives of Deloitte &
Touche LLP, which is our independent registered public accounting firm, to discuss the adequacy of Enterprise Products Partners
L.P.’s internal controls over financial reporting, consolidated financial statements and the nature, extent and results of the audit
effort.  Management reviews all of Enterprise Products Partners L.P.’s significant accounting policies and assumptions that affect its
results of operations with the Audit and Conflicts Committee.  Both the independent registered public accounting firm and our
internal auditors have direct access to the Audit and Conflicts Committee without the presence of management.
Deloitte & Touche LLP has issued its attestation report regarding our internal control over financial reporting.  See “Report of
Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm” included within this Part II, Item 9A.
Pursuant to the requirements of Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, this annual
report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting has been signed below by the following persons on behalf of the registrant and

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Board of Directors of Enterprise Products Holdings LLC and
Unitholders of Enterprise Products Partners L.P.
 
Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Enterprise Products Partners L.P. and subsidiaries (the “Company”)
as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material
respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal
Control—Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.
 We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)
(PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, of the Company and our report
dated February 28, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment
of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on
Internal Control over Financial Reporting as of December 31, 2022.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are
required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules
and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a
material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed
risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a
reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles.  A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain
to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of
the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that
could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because
of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Terminals) from October 2012 to October 2015.   He has also served us in various other leadership positions, including in the areas
of NGL marketing and supply, commercial development, distribution, and business analysis.   Mr. Secrest has over 25 years of
experience in the energy industry and began his career at Basis Petroleum Inc. prior to joining EPCO in 1996.
Director Experience, Qualifications, Attributes and Skills
The following is a brief discussion of the experience, qualifications, attributes and skills that led us to the conclusion that each of
the following persons should serve as a director of Enterprise GP.
Five of our directors are current employees of EPCO and officers of Enterprise GP or its affiliates.  Each of these directors has
significant experience in our industry as executive officers as well as other qualifications, attributes and skills.  These include:
•for Ms. Duncan Williams, legal and community involvement with numerous charitable organizations, and active
involvement in EPCO’s businesses, including ownership in and management of our businesses;
•for Mr. Teague, over 50 years of commercial management of midstream assets and marketing and trading activities, both for
third parties and for us;
•for Mr. Fowler, over 23 years of experience with our midstream assets, including finance, accounting and investor relations
and, for over 17 years, as a member of our executive management team;
•for Mr. Bachmann, over 40 years of experience with our midstream assets, including legal, regulatory, contracts and mergers
and acquisitions and, for over 23 years, as a member of either EPCO’s or our executive management teams; and
•for Mr. Weitzel, over 30 years of experience in Texas and California as a commercial litigator, having successfully
represented individual, corporate and governmental clients as plaintiffs and defendants in a wide variety of business-related
matters.
Our six outside voting directors also have significant experience in a variety of capacities, as well as other qualifications, attributes
and skills.  These include:
•for Ms. Barth, executive management experience in various financial and governance roles;
•for Mr. Brasseux, executive management experience in banking and finance as well as governance roles;
•for Mrs. Followill, executive management experience in the financial services industry (including in the areas of analysis
and assessing the valuations and competitiveness of public and private companies in the energy industry);
•for Mr. Hackett, executive management of a major oil and gas exploration and production company;
•for Mr. Montgomery, executive management of both an investment banking firm and a private equity investment firm
serving the global energy industry; and
•for Mr. Rutherford, executive management experience in the midstream energy industry (including in the areas of strategic
planning, mergers and acquisitions, investment banking and finance).
As advisory directors, Mr. Smith has experience in banking and investment matters and Mr. Snell has experience involving
complex legal and accounting matters.  As an honorary director, Mr. Andras has a long history with us and our operations, including
being a former CEO.

Partnership Governance
We are committed to sound principles of governance.  Such principles are critical for us to achieve our performance goals and
maintain the trust and confidence of investors, employees, suppliers, business partners and other stakeholders.
A key element of strong governance is having independent members of the Board.  Pursuant to the NYSE listing standards, a
director will be considered independent if the Board determines that he or she does not have a material relationship with Enterprise
GP or us (either directly or as a partner, unitholder or officer of an organization that has a material relationship with Enterprise GP
or us).  Based on the foregoing, the Board has affirmatively determined that Ms. Barth, Mrs. Followill and Messrs. Brasseux,
Hackett, Montgomery and Rutherford are independent directors under the NYSE rules.
Because we are a limited partnership and meet the definition of a “controlled company” under the listing standards of the NYSE,
we are not required to comply with certain NYSE rules.  In particular, we are not required to comply with Section 303A.01 of the
NYSE Listed Company Manual, which would require that the Board of Enterprise GP be comprised of a majority of independent
directors.  Currently, six of the eleven Board members of Enterprise GP are independent under NYSE rules; however, this
composition may not always be in effect.  Also, we have elected to not comply with Sections 303A.04 and 303A.05 of the NYSE
Listed Company Manual, which would require that the Board of Enterprise GP maintain a Nominating Committee and a
Compensation Committee, each consisting entirely of independent directors.
Code of Conduct and Ethics and Corporate Governance Guidelines
Enterprise GP has adopted a Code of Conduct that applies to its directors, officers and employees.  This code sets forth our
requirements for compliance with legal and ethical standards in the conduct of our business, including general business principles,
legal and ethical obligations, compliance policies for specific subjects, obtaining guidance on complying with the code, the
reporting of compliance issues, and discipline for violations of the code.  The Code of Conduct also establishes policies applicable
to our Co-CEOs and CFO, and senior financial and other managers to prevent wrongdoing and to promote honest and ethical
conduct, including ethical handling of actual and apparent conflicts of interest, compliance with applicable laws, rules and
regulations, full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in public communications, and prompt internal reporting of
violations of the code (and thus accountability for adherence to the code).  Employees are required to certify their understanding
and compliance with the Code of Conduct on an annual basis.  Training on the Code of Conduct is also provided to employees,
where applicable.
Governance guidelines, together with applicable committee charters, provide the framework for effective governance of our
partnership.  The Board has adopted the Governance Guidelines of Enterprise Products Partners (“Governance Guidelines”),
which address several matters, including qualifications for directors, responsibilities of directors, limitations on service to other
companies, retirement of directors, the composition and responsibilities of Board committees, the conduct and frequency of Board
and committee meetings, management succession plans, director access to management and outside advisors, director
compensation, director and executive officer equity ownership, director orientation and continuing education, and annual self-
evaluation of the Board.  The Board recognizes that effective governance is an on-going process, and thus, it will review the
Governance Guidelines annually or more often as deemed necessary.

Audit and Conflicts Committee
The purpose of the Board’s Audit and Conflicts Committee is to address audit and conflicts-related matters.  In accordance with
NYSE rules and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Board has named three of its members to serve on the Audit and
Conflicts Committee.  Members of the Audit and Conflicts Committee must have a basic understanding of finance and accounting
matters and be able to read and understand financial statements, and at least one member of the Audit and Conflicts Committee
shall have accounting or related financial management expertise.  The current members of the Audit and Conflicts Committee are
Mrs. Followill and Messrs. Brasseux and Montgomery, all of whom are independent directors, free from any relationship with us or
any of our subsidiaries that would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment.  The Board has affirmatively determined
that Mr. Montgomery satisfies the definition of “Audit Committee Financial Expert” as that term is defined in Item 407(d)(5) of
Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC.
The primary responsibilities of the Audit and Conflicts Committee include (i) reviewing potential conflicts of interest, including
related party transactions, (ii) monitoring the integrity of our financial reporting process and related systems of internal control, (iii)
ensuring our legal and regulatory compliance and that of Enterprise GP, (iv) overseeing the independence and performance of our
independent public accountant, (v) approving all services performed by our independent public accountant, (vi) providing for an
avenue of communication among the independent public accountant, management, internal audit function and the Board, (vii)
encouraging adherence to and continuous improvement of our policies, procedures and practices at all levels and (viii) reviewing
areas of potential significant financial risk to our businesses.
If the Board believes that a particular matter presents a conflict of interest and proposes a resolution, the Audit and Conflicts
Committee has the authority to review such matter to determine if the proposed resolution is fair and reasonable to us.  Any matters
approved by the Audit and Conflicts Committee are conclusively deemed to be fair and reasonable to us, approved by all of our
partners and not a breach by Enterprise GP or the Board of any duties they may owe us or our unitholders.
Pursuant to its formal written charter, the Audit and Conflicts Committee has the authority to conduct any investigation appropriate
to fulfilling its responsibilities, and it has direct access to our independent public accountants as well as any EPCO personnel whom
it deems necessary in fulfilling its responsibilities.  The Audit and Conflicts Committee has the ability to retain, at our expense,
special legal, accounting or other consultants or experts it deems necessary in the performance of its duties.
Governance Committee
The primary purpose of the Governance Committee is to develop and recommend to the Board a set of governance guidelines
applicable to our partnership, to review such guidelines from time to time and to oversee governance matters related to our
business, including Board and Committee composition, qualifications of Board candidates, director independence, succession
planning and related matters.  The Governance Committee also assists in Board oversight of management’s establishment and
administration of our environmental, safety and transportation compliance policies, procedures, programs and initiatives, and
related matters.  In accordance with its charter, the Governance Committee shall be composed of not less than three members, at
least a majority of whom shall be independent directors. Currently, the Governance Committee is comprised of three independent
directors (Ms. Barth, Mr. Hackett and Mr. Rutherford).
Like the Audit and Conflicts Committee, the Governance Committee has the authority to conduct any investigation appropriate to
fulfilling its responsibilities, and it has direct access to our independent public accountants as well as any EPCO personnel whom it
deems necessary in fulfilling its responsibilities.  In addition, the Governance Committee has the ability to retain, at our expense,
special legal, accounting or other consultants or experts it deems necessary in the performance of its duties.
A subcommittee of the Governance Committee, the Incentive Plan Administration Subcommittee, is involved in decision-making
regarding employee compensation matters, including grants of equity-based awards.  In accordance with the Governance
Committee charter, this subcommittee shall be composed of two or more non-employee directors (currently, Ms. Barth, Mr. Hackett
and Mr. Rutherford) and shall (i) review and approve all aspects of compensation of our Co-CEOs and CFO, (ii) administer the
long-term incentive plans of the Partnership and its affiliates and (iii) review and approve all equity grants made to employees,
consultants and/or directors as required by such long-term incentive plans.  For more information regarding this subcommittee’s
role in executive compensation matters, see “Overview of Decision-Making Process regarding Compensation of Named Executive
Officers” under Part III, Item 11 of this annual report.

Capital Projects Committee
The primary purpose of the Capital Projects Committee is to review and approve certain expenditures by Enterprise GP, the
Partnership and/or their respective consolidated subsidiaries in connection with proposed capital projects.  Currently, the Capital
Projects Committee is comprised of Ms. Duncan Williams, Ms. Barth and Messrs. Bachmann, Brasseux, Fowler, Hackett, Teague
and Weitzel.  Messrs. Teague and Fowler are co-chairmen of the Capital Projects Committee.
Investor Access to Partnership Governance Information
We provide investors access to information relating to our governance procedures and principles, including the Code of Conduct,
Governance Guidelines, the charters of the Audit and Conflicts Committee, the Governance Committee and the Capital Projects
Committee, along with other information, through our website, www.enterpriseproducts.com.  You may also contact our Investor
Relations department at (866) 230-0745 for printed copies of these documents free of charge.
NYSE Corporate Governance Listing Standards
On March 24, 2022, Mr. Teague certified to the NYSE (as required by Section 303A.12(a) of the NYSE Listed Company Manual)
that he was not aware of any violation by us of the NYSE’s Corporate Governance listing standards as of that date.
Executive Sessions of Non-Management Directors
The Board holds regular executive sessions in which non-management directors meet without any members of management
present.  The purpose of these executive sessions is to promote open and candid discussion among the non-management directors. 
During such executive sessions, one director is designated as the presiding director, who is responsible for leading and facilitating
such executive sessions. Currently, the presiding director is Mr. Montgomery.
Confidential Telephone Hotline
In accordance with NYSE rules, we have established a toll-free, confidential telephone hotline (the “Hotline”) so that interested
parties may communicate with the presiding director or with all the non-management directors of Enterprise GP as a group.  All
calls to this Hotline are reported to the chairman of the Audit and Conflicts Committee, who is responsible for communicating any
necessary information to the other non-management directors.  The number of our confidential Hotline is (844) 693-4318.

ITEM 11.  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION.
Executive Officer Compensation
We do not directly employ any of the persons responsible for managing our business.  Instead, we are managed by Enterprise GP,
the executive officers of which are employees of EPCO. Our management, administrative and operating functions are primarily
performed by employees of EPCO in accordance with the ASA.  Pursuant to the ASA, we reimburse EPCO for its compensation
costs related to the employment of personnel working on our behalf.  For information regarding the ASA, see Note 15 of the Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report.
Summary Compensation Table
The following table presents total compensation amounts paid, accrued or otherwise expensed by us with respect to our (i) co-
CEOs, (ii) CFO and (iii) three highest paid officers of our general partner, other than our principal executive and financial officers,
who were serving in such capacity at December 31, 2022.  Collectively, these five individuals were our “named executive officers”
for 2022.  To the extent such individuals were also named executive officers for 2021 and 2020, their total compensation for those

employee retention agreements involving our named executive officers see “Compensation Discussion and Analysis” below.
Compensation Discussion and Analysis
Elements of Compensation
With respect to our named executive officers, compensation paid or awarded by us reflects only that portion of compensation paid
by EPCO and allocated to us pursuant to the ASA, including an allocation of a portion of the cost of long-term incentive plans of
EPCO. The elements of EPCO’s compensation program, along with EPCO’s other incentives (e.g., benefits, work environment and
career development), are intended to provide a total rewards package to employees.  The objective of EPCO’s compensation
program is to provide competitive compensation opportunities that will align and drive employee performance toward the creation
of sustained long-term unitholder value.  We believe that our compensation program allows us to attract, motivate and retain high
quality talent with the skills and competencies that we require.  Our compensation packages are designed to reward contributions
by employees in support of the business strategies of EPCO and its affiliates at both our partnership and individual levels and to
avoid risks that are likely to conflict with our risk management policies.
For the three years ended December 31, 2022, the primary elements of compensation for the named executive officers consisted of
annual cash base salary, a discretionary annual bonus, equity awards under long-term incentive arrangements and other
compensation, including very limited perquisites.  With respect to the annual periods presented in the Summary Compensation
Table, EPCO’s compensation package for the named executive officers did not include any compensation elements based on
targeted performance-based criteria.  We believe that the absence of targeted performance-based criteria has the effect of
discouraging excessive risk taking by our named executive officers.
Changes in the base salaries of our named executive officers during the three years ended December 31, 2022 were largely budget-
driven and made consistent relative to increases in the base salaries of our other executive officers.
The bonus awards are discretionary and, in combination with annual base salaries, are intended to yield competitive total
compensation levels for the named executive officers and drive performance in support of our business strategies.  The annual
bonus amount presented for each named executive officer reflects a general consideration of our overall financial and certain
operating results for those periods.  This general consideration takes into account a number of our financial measures, including
cash flow from operating activities per unit, distributable cash flow per unit, gross operating margin, return on invested capital, and
our 3-year and 5-year equity total return performance relative to peers.  Operating results considered include certain safety
performance and environmental, safety and governance (“ESG”) measures, including direct carbon dioxide equivalent (“CO2-e”)
emission measures.  No weight or formula is given to any specific financial or operating performance measure.  In addition, a
subjective judgment of each named executive officer’s performance for those periods is taken into account and reflected in the
annual bonus amounts.  The bonus amounts are also based on the level and position of such named executive officers and the
relative compensation paid to our other executive officers, and subjective judgment with respect to overall performance measures
may differ based on the position of each named executive officer.
104
Table of Contents
Each of our named executive officers has been granted equity-based compensation.  The amount of equity-based compensation
granted to our named executive officers reflects a general consideration of our overall financial and certain operating results
described in the preceding paragraph, along with a subjective judgment of each named executive officer’s contribution in support of
that performance, without any weight or formula given to any specific financial or operating performance measure.  The values of
equity-based awards granted to the named executive officers are also based on the level and position of such named executive
officers and the relative compensation paid to our other executive officers.  Each of the named executive officers received grants of
phantom unit awards for the periods presented in the summary compensation table.
Historically, each of our named executive officers was granted a “profits interest” award in one or more Employee Partnerships,
which function as long-term incentive arrangements for key employees of EPCO.  If certain conditions are met, the employee
participants in each Employee Partnership will be entitled to (i) a residual profits interest in the assets of the Employee Partnership
at liquidation, along with (ii) quarterly cash distributions.  The residual assets to be distributed, if any, consist of common units of
Enterprise Products Partners L.P. owned by the Employee Partnership.
The last remaining Employee Partnership in which one or more of our named executive officers currently participate, EPD 2018
Unit IV L.P. (“EPD IV”), is scheduled to liquidate in December 2023.  Messrs. Bacon, Secrest and Nelly were granted profits
interest awards in EPD IV.
EPCO expects to continue its policy of paying for limited perquisites attributable to our named executive officers.  EPCO also
makes matching contributions under its defined contribution plans for the benefit of our named executive officers in the same
manner as it does for other EPCO employees.
EPCO does not offer our named executive officers a defined benefit pension plan.  Also, none of our named executive officers had
nonqualified deferred compensation during the three years ended December 31, 2022.
In the second quarter of 2019, each of our named executive officers entered into a separate retention bonus agreement with EPCO. 
Pursuant to the retention bonus agreements, each such person was or will be entitled to a cash retention payment of $5 million (in
the case of each of Messrs. Teague and Fowler), $1 million (in the case of each of Messrs. Bacon and Secrest) and $500,000 (in the
case of Mr. Nelly), less all applicable withholding taxes and other required deductions on such payment (in each case, the
applicable “Retention Payment”), in a lump sum within seven business days following his completion of continuous active fulltime
employment with EPCO from April 15, 2019 through (i) May 31, 2022 (in the case of Mr. Teague) or (ii) May 31, 2023 (in the case
of each of Messrs. Fowler, Bacon, Secrest and Nelly) (in each case, the applicable “Retention Period”), and provided that such
person continues to perform his duties during the applicable Retention Period in a highly effective manner, as determined by the
key executives of EPCO (the “Performance Requirement”).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of an involuntary termination of any such person’s employment prior to the end of his
applicable Retention Period for specified reasons, including death, disability or termination of his employment by EPCO other than
for “cause” (as defined in each retention bonus agreement), such person will receive (or in the event of his death, his designated
beneficiary will receive), a cash payment equal to a pro-rata amount of his applicable Retention Payment, determined based on the
number of days he is employed during the applicable Retention Period over the total number of days in such Retention Period
(subject to meeting the Performance Requirement through his termination date).  Any Retention Payment is in addition to any
discretionary incentive compensation that EPCO or any of its affiliates may grant or have in place from time to time.
The applicable Retention Period and Performance Requirement under Mr. Teague’s retention bonus agreement were satisfied on
May 31, 2022, and the full amount of Mr. Teague’s applicable Retention Payment was paid to him in June 2022.

Overview of Decision-Making Process Regarding Compensation of Named Executive Officers
A subcommittee of the Governance Committee of our general partner, the Incentive Plan Administration Subcommittee (the “IPA
Subcommittee”), has final and ultimate decision-making authority with respect to all aspects of compensation of our Co-CEOs and
CFO.  The IPA Subcommittee, at its sole option and in its sole discretion, consider input and recommendations from the EPCO
Trustees and EPCO’s Human Resources department in making its compensation decisions for our Co-CEOs and CFO.  The current
members of the IPA Subcommittee are Ms. Barth, Mr. Hackett and Mr. Rutherford, all of whom are “Non-Employee Directors” (as
defined in SEC Rule 16b-3).
The compensation of our other named executive officers (other than equity-based awards granted under EPCO’s long-term
incentive plans) is determined by our Co-CEOs.  Neither EPCO nor Enterprise GP has a separate compensation committee;
however, grants of equity-based compensation under EPCO’s long-term incentive plans (e.g., phantom unit awards) to our named
executive officers, including our Co-CEOs, have been approved by the IPA Subcommittee.
The issuance of profits interest awards was approved by EPCO’s board of directors.
The overall compensation for each named executive officer is not based on any formula or specific performance criteria; rather, the
IPA Subcommittee, our Co-CEOs, and EPCO (as applicable) determine an appropriate level and mix of compensation for each
officer on a case-by-case basis.  Further, there is no established policy or target for the allocation between either cash and non-cash
or short-term and long-term incentive compensation.  However, some considerations that may be taken into account in making the
case-by-case compensation determinations include the total value of all elements of compensation, the appropriate balance of
internal pay equity among our executive officers, individual performance and potential, levels of responsibility and value to the
organization.  All compensation determinations are subjective and discretionary.
In making compensation decisions, EPCO considers market data for determining relevant compensation levels and compensation
program elements through the review of and, in certain cases, participation in, relevant compensation surveys and reports.  These
surveys and reports are conducted and prepared by third party compensation consultants.  In 2021, EPCO engaged Meridian
Compensation Partners, LLC (the “Consultant”) to complete a detailed review of executive compensation relative to our industry. 
In connection with this review, the Consultant provided comparative market data on compensation practices and programs for
executive level positions based on an analysis of industry participants.  The market data for industry participants included
information from CenterPoint Energy, Inc.; Dominion Energy, Inc.; Enbridge Inc.; Energy Transfer LP; Kinder Morgan Inc.;
Magellan Midstream Partners, L.P.; ONEOK, Inc.; Plains All American Pipeline, L.P.; Targa Resources Corporation; The Williams
Companies, Inc.; and TC Energy Corporation. 
Neither we, nor EPCO, which engaged the Consultant, are aware of the specific data of the companies included in the Consultant’s
proprietary database for specific positions. EPCO uses the information provided in the Consultant’s analysis to gauge whether
compensation levels reported by the Consultant and the general ranges of compensation for EPCO employees in similar positions
are comparable. However, that comparison is only a factor taken into consideration and may or may not impact compensation of
our named executive officers.  EPCO does not otherwise engage in benchmarking for the named executive officers’ positions.

Table of Contents
Allocation of Compensation Between Us and EPCO and its Other Affiliates
Under the ASA, the compensation costs of our named executive officers, including those costs related to equity-based awards, are
allocated between us and other affiliates of EPCO based on the estimated amount of time that each officer spends on our
consolidated businesses in any fiscal year.  These percentages are reassessed at least quarterly.
With the exception of Messrs. Fowler and Nelly, each of our named executive officers devoted all of their time to our consolidated
businesses during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. Mr. Fowler devoted approximately 75% of his time to our
consolidated businesses during this three year period, with the remainder of his time allocated to EPCO and its privately held
affiliates. On average, Mr. Nelly devoted approximately 97.5% of his time to our consolidated businesses during this three year
period, with the remainder of his time allocated to EPCO and its privately held affiliates.
Grants of Equity-Based Awards in Fiscal Year 2022

(1) Amounts presented reflect that portion of grant date fair value allocable to us based on the estimated percentage of time each named executive officer spent
on our consolidated business activities during 2022.  Based on current allocations, we estimate that the compensation expense we record for each named
executive officer with respect to these awards will equal these amounts over time.
(2) The grant date fair value presented for the phantom unit awards is based, in part, on the closing price of our common units on February 8, 2022 of $24.10 per
unit.
The fair value amounts presented in the preceding table are based on certain assumptions and considerations made by
management.  For information regarding these assumptions and considerations, see Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report.
The 2008 Enterprise Products Long-Term Incentive Plan (Fourth Amendment and Restatement) (the “2008 Plan”) provides for
incentive awards to EPCO’s key employees and non-employee directors and consultants who perform management, administrative
or operational functions for us or our affiliates. Awards granted under the 2008 Plan may be in the form of phantom units, DERs,
restricted common units, unit options, unit appreciation rights and other unit-based awards or substitute awards.  For information
regarding the number of common units authorized for issuance under the 2008 Plan, see “Securities Authorized for Issuance Under
Equity Compensation Plans” under Part III, Item 12 of this annual report.

Phantom unit awards
Phantom unit awards allow recipients to acquire our common units (at no cost to the recipient apart from fulfilling service and other
conditions) once a defined vesting period expires, subject to customary forfeiture provisions.  Phantom unit awards generally vest
at a rate of 25% per year beginning one year after the grant date.  Each phantom unit award includes a tandem DER, which entitles
the holder to nonforfeitable cash payments equal to the product of the number of phantom unit awards outstanding for the
participant and the cash distribution per common unit paid to our common unitholders.
Vesting of Equity-Based Awards in 2022
The following table presents the vesting of phantom unit awards and profits interest awards to our named executive officers during
the year ended December 31, 2022.  These amounts are presented on a gross basis and do not reflect any allocation of

(3) With respect to amounts presented for the profits interest awards, amount represents the estimated liquidation value to be received by the named executive
officer based on the closing price of Partnership common units on December 30, 2022 and the terms of liquidation outlined in the applicable Employee
Partnership agreement.  There was no residual profits interest in any of the Employee Partnerships due to a decrease in the market value of the Partnership
common units they own since the formation date of each respective Employee Partnership.
(4) Of the 1,855,750 phantom unit awards presented in the table, the vesting schedule is as follows: 697,750 in 2023; 562,500 in 2024; 394,250 in 2025 and
201,250 in 2026.
(5) With respect to EPD IV, the profits interest share held by Messrs. Bacon, Secrest and Nelly at December 31, 2022 was approximately 5.78%, 4.62% and
2.89%, respectively.  The expected vesting date for EPD IV is December 2023.
Phantom unit awards
For a description of phantom unit awards, see “Grants of Equity-Based Awards in Fiscal Year 2022” within this Item 11.
Profits interest awards
For a description of the profits interest awards, see Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part
II, Item 8 of this annual report.
Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change-in-Control
None of the named executive officers have any employment agreements that call for the payment of termination or severance
benefits or provide for any payments in the event of a change in control of Enterprise GP.
The vesting of profits interest awards under the Employee Partnerships is subject to acceleration upon a change of control.  In
addition, the vesting of equity-based awards under EPCO’s long-term incentive plans is subject to acceleration upon a qualifying
termination, including termination after a change of control of Enterprise GP. A qualifying termination under such awards generally
means a termination as an employee of EPCO or an affiliated group member (i) upon death, (ii) a qualifying long-term disability,
(iii) a qualifying retirement, or (iv) within one year after a change of control, other than a termination for cause or termination by
such person that is not a qualifying termination for good reason (as such terms are defined in the underlying plan documents).
109
Table of Contents
A “change of control” under these awards is generally defined to mean that the descendants, heirs and/or legatees of Dan L Duncan,
and/or trusts (including, without limitation, one or more voting trusts) established for their benefit, collectively, cease, directly or
indirectly, to control our general partner.  Mr. Duncan passed away in March 2010.
EPCO has entered into outstanding retention bonus agreements with each of Messrs. Fowler, Bacon, Secrest and Nelly, which are
described under “Compensation Discussion and Analysis” within this Part III, Item 11.  These agreements provide that, in the event
of an involuntary termination of any such person’s employment prior to the end of his applicable Retention Period for specified
reasons, including death, disability or termination of his employment by EPCO other than for “cause” (as defined in each retention
bonus agreement), such person will receive (or in the event of his death, his designated beneficiary will receive), a cash payment
equal to a pro-rata amount of his applicable Retention Payment (set forth previously), determined based on the number of days he is
employed during the applicable Retention Period over the total number of days in such Retention Period (subject to meeting the
Performance Requirement through the termination date).
Compensation Committee Report
We do not have a separate compensation committee.  In addition, we do not directly employ or compensate our named executive
officers.  Rather, under the ASA, we reimburse EPCO for the compensation of our executive officers.  As described in
Compensation Discussion and Analysis, decisions regarding the compensation of our named executive officers with respect to 2022
were made, as applicable, by EPCO and Enterprise GP’s Co-CEOs, CFO and the IPA Subcommittee.
In light of the foregoing, the Board has reviewed and discussed with management the Compensation Discussion and Analysis set
forth above and determined that it be included in this annual report for the year ended December 31, 2022.

Exchange Act, as amended, that incorporate future filings, including this annual report, in whole or in part, the foregoing
Compensation Committee Report shall not be incorporated by reference into any such filings.
Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation
None of the directors or executive officers of Enterprise GP served as members of the compensation committee of another entity
that has or had an executive officer who served as a member of our Board during the year ended December 31, 2022.  As
previously noted, we do not have a separate compensation committee.  As described in Compensation Discussion and Analysis,
decisions regarding the compensation of our named executive officers with respect to 2022 were made, as applicable, by EPCO and
Enterprise GP’s Co-CEOs, CFO and the IPA Subcommittee.
Pay Ratio Disclosure
The median of the total annual compensation of all employees of EPCO, other than our Co-CEOs, was $126,301 for the year ended
December 31, 2022 (the “fiscal 2022 median total annual compensation”). Mr. Teague and Mr. Fowler served as Co-CEOs of
Enterprise GP during the year ended December 31, 2022.  Mr. Teague’s fiscal 2022 annual total compensation was $17,353,813 and
Mr. Fowler’s fiscal 2022 annual total compensation allocated to us was $9,243,739.  The ratio of the fiscal 2022 median total
annual compensation to Mr. Teague’s fiscal 2022 annual total compensation was 137:1.  The ratio of the fiscal 2022 median total
annual compensation to Mr. Fowler’s fiscal 2022 annual total compensation was 73:1. 
The fiscal 2022 median total annual compensation was determined as follows:
110
Table of Contents
•  First, a list was prepared of all active EPCO employees, excluding Mr. Teague, Mr. Fowler and those on long-term
disability, that devote all or a substantial portion of their time to our consolidated businesses and affairs.   This list was based
on employee information as of December 31, 2022. There are approximately 7,300 EPCO personnel who spend all or a
substantial portion of their time engaged in our business. 
•Second, basic wage data for each active EPCO employee, excluding Mr. Teague, Mr. Fowler and those on long-term
disability, was extracted from Form W-2 information provided to the Internal Revenue Service for fiscal 2022. This
information was then sorted and the employee who earned the median compensation (the “median employee”) was selected
from the list.
•Third, once the median employee was selected, his or her respective total annual compensation for 2022 was determined
using the same method used to determine Mr. Teague’s and Mr. Fowler’s total annual compensation for 2022 as presented in
the Summary Compensation Table within this Part III, Item 11.
Director Compensation
For the year ended December 31, 2022, each of the independent voting directors of Enterprise GP received the following
compensation:
•a $90,000 annual cash retainer and an annual grant of the Partnership’s common units having a fair market value of $90,000,
based on the closing price of such common units on the trading day immediately preceding grant date;
•a $2,500 per meeting cash fee for attendance at each meeting of the Board (other than a quarterly Board meeting);
•a $2,500 per meeting cash fee for attendance at each meeting of a committee or subcommittee of which such director is a
member (other than any committee or subcommittee meeting that occurs on the same day as (i) a Board meeting and/or (ii) a
previous meeting of a committee or subcommittee of which such director is a member);
•if the individual served as a chairman of the Audit and Conflicts Committee, an additional $25,000 annual cash retainer; and
•if the individual served as a chairman of the Governance Committee, an additional $20,000 annual cash retainer.
The compensation program for independent voting directors for 2023 is expected to be the same as 2022.
We bear all costs attributable to the compensation of independent voting directors of Enterprise GP. The following table

Enterprise GP’s directors and executive officers.  Under these guidelines:
•each non-management director of Enterprise GP is required to own our common units having an aggregate value (as defined
in the guidelines) of three times the dollar amount of such non-management director’s aggregate annual cash retainer for
service on the Board for the most recently completed calendar year; and
•each executive officer of Enterprise GP is required to own our common units having an aggregate value (as defined in the
guidelines) of three times the dollar amount of such executive officer’s aggregate annual base salary for the most recently
completed calendar year.

Securities Authorized for Issuance Under Equity Compensation Plans
The 2008 Enterprise Products Long-Term Incentive Plan (as amended and restated to date, the “2008 Plan”) is EPCO’s only long-
term incentive plan under which our common units have been authorized for issuance.  The 2008 Plan provides for awards of our
common units and other rights to our non-management directors and to consultants and employees of EPCO and its affiliates
providing services to us.  Awards under the 2008 Plan may be granted in the form of phantom units, DERs, unit options, restricted
common units, UARs, unit awards and other unit-based awards or substitute awards.

ITEM 13.  CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS,
AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE.
Certain Relationships and Related Transactions
We believe that the terms and provisions of our related party agreements are fair to us; however, such agreements and transactions
may not be as favorable to us as we could have obtained from unaffiliated third parties.
Additional information regarding our related party transactions is set forth in Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report and is incorporated by reference into this Part III, Item 13.
Review and Approval of Transactions with Related Parties
We consider transactions between us and our subsidiaries and unconsolidated affiliates, on the one hand, and our executive officers
and directors (or their immediate family members), Enterprise GP or its affiliates (including other companies owned or controlled
by the DD LLC Trustees or the EPCO Trustees), on the other hand, to be related party transactions.  As further described below, our
partnership agreement sets forth general procedures by which related party transactions and conflicts of interest may be approved or
resolved by Enterprise GP or its Audit and Conflicts Committee.  In addition, the Audit and Conflicts Committee charter, Enterprise
GP’s written internal review and approval policies and procedures (referred to as its “management authorization policy”) and the
amended and restated ASA with EPCO address specific types of related party transactions, as further described below.
Our Audit and Conflicts Committee is comprised of three independent directors: Mrs. Followill and Messrs. Brasseux and 
Montgomery.  In accordance with its charter, the Audit and Conflicts Committee reviews and approves related party transactions:
•pursuant to our partnership agreement or the limited liability company agreement of Enterprise GP, as such agreements may
be amended from time to time, including without limitation for the purpose of obtaining “Special Approval” (as described
below);
•in which an officer or director of Enterprise GP or any of our subsidiaries, or an immediate family member of such an officer
or director, has an interest that is financially material to such officer, director or immediate family member (as applicable) or
is otherwise a named party;
•when requested to do so by management or the Board;
•in accordance with and to the extent required under Rule 314.00 of the Listed Company Manual of the NYSE;
•with a value of $5 million or more (unless such transaction is equivalent to an arm’s length transaction with a third party); or
•that it may otherwise deem appropriate from time to time.
Enterprise GP’s management authorization policy generally requires Board approval for asset purchase or sales transactions to the
extent such transactions have a value in excess of $1.0 billion and capital investments to the extent such transactions have a value
in excess of $500 million.  Any such transaction would typically also require Audit and Conflicts Committee review under its
charter if such transaction is also a related party transaction.
As noted previously, all of our management, administrative and operating functions are performed by employees of EPCO
(pursuant to an administrative services agreement, or ASA) or by other service providers.  The ASA governs numerous day-to-day
transactions between us, Enterprise GP and EPCO and its affiliates, including the provision by EPCO of administrative and other
services to us and our reimbursement to EPCO of costs, without markup or discount, for those services.  The ASA was reviewed,
approved and recommended to the Board by our Audit and Conflicts Committee, and the Board also approved it upon receiving
such recommendation.
115
Table of Contents
Related party transactions that are outside the scope of the ASA and not reviewed by the Audit and Conflicts Committee are subject
to Enterprise GP’s management authorization policy.  This policy, which applies to related party transactions as well as transactions
with third parties, specifies thresholds for our general partner’s officers and Board to authorize various categories of transactions,
including purchases and sales of assets, commercial and financial transactions and legal agreements.
Partnership Agreement Standards for Audit and Conflicts Committee Review
Under our partnership agreement, whenever a potential conflict of interest exists or arises between Enterprise GP or any of its
affiliates, on the one hand, and us, any of our subsidiaries or any partner, on the other hand, any resolution or course of action by
Enterprise GP or its affiliates in respect of such conflict of interest is permitted and deemed approved by our limited partners, and
will not constitute a breach of our partnership agreement or any agreement contemplated by such agreement, or of any duty stated
or implied by law or equity, if the resolution or course of action is or, by operation of the partnership agreement is deemed to be,
fair and reasonable to us; provided that, any conflict of interest and any resolution of such conflict of interest will be conclusively
deemed fair and reasonable to us if such conflict of interest or resolution is (i) approved by a majority of the members of the Audit
and Conflicts Committee (i.e., a “Special Approval” is granted) or (ii) on terms objectively demonstrable to be no less favorable to
us than those generally being provided to or available from third parties.
The Audit and Conflicts Committee (in connection with its Special Approval process) may consider the following when resolving
conflicts of interest:
•the relative interests of any party to such conflict, agreement, transaction or situation and the benefits and burdens relating to
such interest;
•the totality of the relationships between the parties involved (including other transactions that may be particularly favorable
or advantageous to us);
•any customary or accepted industry practices and any customary or historical dealings with a particular party;
•any applicable generally accepted accounting or engineering practices or principles;
•the relative cost of capital of the parties involved and the consequent rates of return to the equity holders of such parties; and
•such additional factors as the Audit and Conflicts Committee determines in its sole discretion to be relevant, reasonable or
appropriate under the circumstances.

The level of review and work performed by the Audit and Conflicts Committee with respect to a given transaction varies depending

Audit and Conflicts Committee may, as it deems appropriate, perform in the course of reviewing a transaction include, but are not
limited to:
•assessing the business rationale for the transaction;
•reviewing the terms and conditions of the proposed transaction, including consideration and financing requirements, if any;
•assessing the effect of the transaction on our results of operations, financial condition, cash available for distribution,
properties or prospects;
•conducting due diligence, including interviews and discussions with management and other representatives and reviewing
transaction materials and findings of management and other representatives;
•considering the relative advantages and disadvantages of the transactions to the parties involved;
•engaging third party financial advisors to provide financial advice and assistance, including fairness opinions if requested;
•engaging legal advisors; and
•evaluating and negotiating the transaction and recommending for approval or approving the transaction, as the case may be.
Nothing contained in our partnership agreement requires the Audit and Conflicts Committee to consider the interests of any party
other than us.  In the absence of the Audit and Conflicts Committee or our general partner acting in bad faith, the resolution, action
or terms so made, taken or provided (including granting Special Approval) by the Audit and Conflicts Committee or our general
partner with respect to such matter are deemed conclusive and binding on all persons (including all of our limited partners) and do
not constitute a breach of our partnership agreement, or any other agreement contemplated thereby, or a breach of any standard of
care or duty imposed in our partnership agreement or under the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act or any other
law, rule or regulation.  Our partnership agreement provides that it is presumed that the resolution, action or terms made, taken or
provided by the Audit and Conflicts Committee or our general partner were not made, taken or provided in bad faith, and in any
proceeding brought by any limited partner or by or on behalf of such limited partner or any other limited partner or us challenging
such resolution, action or terms, the person bringing or prosecuting such proceeding will have the burden of overcoming such
presumption.
Director Independence
Each of the current members of the Audit and Conflicts Committee, namely Mrs. Followill and Messrs. Brasseux and 
Montgomery, and each of the current members of the Governance Committee, namely Ms. Barth and Messrs. Hackett and
Rutherford, have been determined to be independent under the applicable NYSE listing standards and rules of the SEC.  For a
discussion of independence standards applicable to our Board and factors considered by our Board in making its independence
determinations, please refer to “Partnership Governance” included under Part III, Item 10 of this annual report.
Other Matters
An immediate family member of Mr. Teague is an employee of EPCO that performs services on our behalf.  This individual does
not serve as an executive officer of Enterprise GP, EPCO or any of their respective affiliates, and such individual’s compensation
and other terms of employment are determined on a basis consistent with EPCO’s human resources policies.  For 2022, this
individual earned total compensation from EPCO of $870 thousand.

ITEM 14.  PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTANT FEES AND SERVICES.
With the approval of the Audit and Conflicts Committee of Enterprise GP, we have engaged Deloitte & Touche LLP, the member
firms of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, and their respective affiliates (collectively, “Deloitte & Touche”) as our independent registered
public accounting firm and principal accountants.  The following table summarizes amounts billed to us by Deloitte & Touche for
each of the years presented, as applicable:
  For the Year Ended December 31, 
  2022   2021  
Audit fees (1)  $ 5,398,000  $ 4,841,797 
(1) Audit fees for 2022 and 2021 include $40,000 and $30,000, respectively, of charges for audit-related projects that were reimbursed by business partners.
As presented in the preceding table, “Audit Fees” represent amounts billed for each year in connection with (i) the annual audit of
our consolidated financial statements filed on Form 10-K and related internal controls over financial reporting, (ii) the quarterly
review of our consolidated financial statements filed on Form 10-Q, (iii) standalone annual audits of our consolidated subsidiaries
and (iv) those services normally provided by Deloitte & Touche in connection with our statutory and regulatory filings or
engagements, including comfort letters, consents and other services related to SEC matters.  We did not engage Deloitte & Touche
to perform any other services for us during the last two years. We are prohibited from using Deloitte & Touche to perform general
bookkeeping, human resources or management functions for us, and any other service not permitted by the PCAOB.
In connection with its oversight responsibilities, the Audit and Conflicts Committee has adopted a pre-approval policy regarding
any services to be performed by Deloitte & Touche.  The pre-approval policy includes four primary service categories: Audit,
Audit-related, Tax and Other. When Deloitte & Touche’s services are required, management and Deloitte & Touche discuss the
proposed work with the Audit and Conflicts Committee.  These discussions typically address the reasons for the project, the scope
of the work to be performed and an estimate of the fee to be charged by Deloitte & Touche for such work.  The Audit and Conflicts
Committee discusses the request with management and Deloitte & Touche and, if the work is deemed necessary and appropriate for
Deloitte & Touche to perform, approves the request subject to the fee estimate (the initial “pre-approved” fee amount).  If at a later
date, it appears that the initial pre-approved fee amount is insufficient to complete the work, management and Deloitte & Touche
must present a supplemental request to the Audit and Conflicts Committee to increase the approved amount along with reasons for
the increase.  Under the pre-approval policy, management cannot act upon its own to authorize an expenditure for Deloitte &
Touche services outside of the pre-approved amounts.  On a quarterly basis, the Audit and Conflicts Committee is provided a
schedule that compares the pre-approved amounts for each primary service category with the actual fees billed for each type of
service.  We believe the Audit and Conflicts Committee’s pre-approval process maintains the independence of Deloitte & Touche
from management.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Board of Directors of Enterprise Products Holdings LLC and
Unitholders of Enterprise Products Partners L.P.
Houston, Texas
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Enterprise Products Partners L.P. and subsidiaries (the
“Company”) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related statements of consolidated operations, comprehensive income, cash
flows, and equity for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to
as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position
of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)
(PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in
Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission and our report dated February 28, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required
to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error
or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements,
whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test
basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the
financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that
were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are
material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The
communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we
are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the
accounts or disclosures to which they relate.
Property, Plant and Equipment, Net and Intangible Assets, Net—Determination of Impairment Indicators—Refer to Notes 2, 4,
and 6 to the consolidated financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
Long-lived assets, which consists of intangible assets with finite useful lives (“intangible assets”) and property, plant and
equipment, are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets
may not be recoverable. As of December 31, 2022, the carrying value of the Company’s property, plant and equipment was $44,401
million and intangible assets was $3,965 million.
F-2
Table of Contents
We have identified the determination of impairment indicators for long-lived assets as a critical audit matter due to the significant
judgments management makes when determining whether events or changes in circumstances have occurred indicating that the
carrying amounts of long-lived assets may not be recoverable. Auditing management’s judgments required a high degree of auditor
judgment when performing audit procedures to evaluate whether management appropriately identified impairment indicators.
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our audit procedures related to the identification of impairment indicators included the following, among others:
•We tested the effectiveness of controls over the identification of events or changes in circumstances that indicate that the
carrying value of long-lived assets may not be recoverable.
•We evaluated management’s analysis of impairment indicators by:
-Assessing whether long-lived assets having indicators of impairment were appropriately identified and further tested
for impairment.
-Comparing the recent gross operating margin results to the carrying value of long-lived assets to determine if there is
an indicator that the carrying value may not be recoverable over the estimated remaining useful life.
-Reading publicly available information for the industry, peers, and customers to determine whether a potential
impairment indicator was not contemplated in management’s analysis.
-Reading minutes of the Board of Directors to understand if there were factors that could represent a potential
impairment indicator not contemplated in management’s analysis.
Navitas Midstream Partners, LLC Acquisition—Fair Value of Acquired Property, Plant and Equipment and Identifiable
Intangible Assets—Refer to Notes 6 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
On February 17, 2022, the Company acquired all of the member interests in Navitas Midstream Partners, LLC (“Navitas”) for $3.2
billion. The transaction was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. The purchase price was allocated based
upon the estimated fair value of the property, plant and equipment and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities
assumed, with any excess purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired recorded to goodwill. Acquired property, plant
and equipment and contract-based identifiable intangible assets were valued at $2,080 million and $989 million, respectively. The
estimated fair value of acquired property, plant and equipment was determined using the cost approach. The estimated fair value of
acquired contract-based identifiable intangible assets was determined using an income approach, specifically a discounted cash
flow analysis which uses inputs including (i) management’s long-term forecast of cash flows generated by the Midland Basin
System and (ii) the discount rate.
We have identified the estimated fair value of property, plant and equipment and contract-based identifiable intangible assets
acquired in the Navitas acquisition as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments made by management in estimating the
respective fair values.
Auditing management’s judgments required a high degree of auditor judgment and increased extent of effort, including the use of
our fair value specialists, when performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management’s selected valuation
methodologies for the acquired property, plant and equipment and contract-based identifiable intangible assets and the assumptions
related to the long-term forecast of cash flows and discount rate used to value the contract-based identifiable intangible assets.

How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our audit procedures related to the valuation of acquired property, plant and equipment and identifiable intangible assets related to
the Navitas acquisition included the following, among others:
•We tested the effectiveness of controls over the estimation of fair value of the acquired property, plant and equipment and
contract-based identifiable intangible assets, including those over assumptions related to contract fees underlying the long-
term forecast of cash flows generated by the Midland Basin System.
•We assessed the experience, qualifications, and objectivity of management’s independent valuation specialist.
•We assessed the reasonableness of management’s long-term forecast of cash flows generated by the Midland Basin System
by agreeing contract fees to the underlying contracts and comparing the projected volumes and revenues to actual results and
publicly available market data.
•With the assistance of our fair value specialists, we evaluated the reasonableness of the (1) valuation methodologies for the
property, plant and equipment and identifiable intangible assets and (2) assumptions related to the discount rate used for the
valuation of contract-based identifiable intangible assets by:
-Evaluating the appropriateness of the methodologies used to value acquired property, plant and equipment and
contract-based identifiable intangible assets.
-Testing the consistent application and mathematical accuracy of management’s selected valuation methodologies.
-Developing an independent range of acceptable discount rates and comparing this range to the discount rate applied by
management in the cash flow analysis used to value acquired contract-based identifiable intangible assets.

Table of Contents
Note 1.  Partnership Organization and Operations
We are a publicly traded Delaware limited partnership, the common units of which are listed on the New York Stock Exchange
(“NYSE”) under the ticker symbol “EPD.”  Our preferred units are not publicly traded.  We were formed in April 1998 to own and
operate certain natural gas liquids (“NGLs”) related businesses of EPCO and are a leading North American provider of midstream
energy services to producers and consumers of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil, petrochemicals and refined products.  We are owned
by our limited partners (preferred and common unitholders) from an economic perspective.  Enterprise GP, which owns a non-
economic general partner interest in us, manages our Partnership.  We conduct substantially all of our business operations through
EPO and its consolidated subsidiaries.
Our fully integrated, midstream energy asset network (or “value chain”) links producers of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil from
some of the largest supply basins in the United States (“U.S.”), Canada and the Gulf of Mexico with domestic consumers and
international markets.  Our midstream energy operations include:
•natural gas gathering, treating, processing, transportation and storage;
•NGL transportation, fractionation, storage, and marine terminals (including those used to export liquefied petroleum gases
(“LPG”) and ethane);
•crude oil gathering, transportation, storage, and marine terminals;
•propylene production facilities (including propane dehydrogenation (“PDH”) facilities), butane isomerization, octane
enhancement, isobutane dehydrogenation (“iBDH”) and high purity isobutylene (“HPIB”) production facilities;
•petrochemical and refined products transportation, storage, and marine terminals (including those used to export ethylene
and polymer grade propylene (“PGP”)); and
•a marine transportation business that operates on key U.S. inland and intracoastal waterway systems. 
Like many publicly traded partnerships, we have no employees.  All of our management, administrative and operating functions are
performed by employees of EPCO pursuant to an administrative services agreement (the “ASA”) or by other service providers.  See
Note 15 for information regarding related party matters.
Our operations are reported under four business segments: NGL Pipelines & Services, Crude Oil Pipelines & Services, Natural Gas
Pipelines & Services and Petrochemical & Refined Products Services.  See Note 10 for additional information regarding our
business segments.
Note 2.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Our consolidated financial statements are prepared on the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles (“GAAP”).
Allowance for Credit Losses
We estimate our allowance for credit losses at each reporting date using a current expected credit loss model, which requires the
measurement of expected credit losses for financial assets (e.g., accounts receivable) based on historical experience with customers,
current economic conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts.  We may also increase the allowance for credit losses in
response to the specific identification of customers involved in bankruptcy proceedings and similar financial difficulties.

Deductions   (6)  (5)  (3)
Balance at end of period  $ 54  $ 53  $ 47 
 
(1)Amount presented for 2020 primarily relates to the reclassification of deferred revenue balances to allowance for credit losses in connection with customer
bankruptcies and contractual disputes.
Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash
Cash and cash equivalents represent unrestricted cash on hand and highly liquid investments with original maturities of less than
three months from the date of purchase.
Restricted cash primarily represents amounts held in segregated bank accounts by our clearing brokers as margin in support of our
commodity derivative instruments portfolio and related physical purchases and sales of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil, refined
products and power.  Additional cash may be restricted to maintain our commodity derivative instruments portfolio as prices
fluctuate or margin requirements change. See Note 14 for information regarding our derivative instruments and hedging activities.
The following table provides a reconciliation of cash and cash equivalents, and restricted cash reported within the Consolidated
Balance Sheets that sum to the total of the amounts shown in the Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows.

Consolidation Policy
Our consolidated financial statements include our accounts and those of our majority-owned subsidiaries in which we have a
controlling interest, after the elimination of all intercompany accounts and transactions.  We also consolidate other entities and
ventures in which we possess a controlling financial interest as well as partnership interests where we are the sole general partner of
the Partnership.  We evaluate our financial interests in business enterprises to determine if they represent variable interest entities
where we are the primary beneficiary.  If such criteria are met, we consolidate the financial statements of such businesses with
those of our own.  Third party or affiliate ownership interests in our controlled subsidiaries are presented as noncontrolling
interests.  See Note 8 for information regarding noncontrolling interests.
If the entity is organized as a limited partnership or limited liability company and maintains separate ownership accounts, we
account for our investment using the equity method if our ownership interest is between 3% and 50%, unless our interest is so
minor that we have virtually no influence over the investee’s operating and financial policies.  For all other types of investments,
we apply the equity method of accounting if our ownership interest is between 20% and 50% and we exercise significant influence
over the investee’s operating and financial policies.  In consolidation, we eliminate our proportionate share of profits and losses
from transactions with equity method unconsolidated affiliates to the extent such amounts remain on our Consolidated Balance
Sheets (or those of our equity method investments) in inventory or similar accounts.

Contingencies
Certain conditions may exist as of the date our consolidated financial statements are issued, which may result in a loss to us but
which will only be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur.  Management has regular quarterly litigation
reviews, including updates from legal counsel, to assess the need for accounting recognition or disclosure of these contingencies,
and such assessment inherently involves an exercise in judgment.  In assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that
are pending against us or unasserted claims that may result in such proceedings, our management and legal counsel evaluate the
perceived merits of any legal proceedings or unasserted claims as well as the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought or
expected to be sought therein.
We accrue an undiscounted liability for those contingencies where the incurrence of a loss is probable and the amount can be
reasonably estimated.  If a range of amounts can be reasonably estimated and no amount within the range is a better estimate than
any other amount, then the minimum of the range is accrued.  We do not record a contingent liability when the likelihood of loss is
probable but the amount cannot be reasonably estimated or when the likelihood of loss is believed to be only reasonably possible or
remote.  For contingencies where an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible and the impact would be material to our
consolidated financial statements, we disclose the nature of the contingency and, where feasible, an estimate of the possible loss or
range of loss.
Loss contingencies considered remote are generally not disclosed unless they involve guarantees, in which case the guarantees
would be disclosed.  See Note 17 for additional information regarding our contingencies.
Current Assets and Current Liabilities
We present, as individual captions in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, all components of current assets and current liabilities that
exceed 5% of total current assets and current liabilities, respectively.
Derivative Instruments
We use derivative instruments such as futures, swaps, forward contracts and other arrangements to manage price risks associated
with inventories, firm commitments, interest rates and certain anticipated future commodity transactions.  To qualify for hedge
accounting, the hedged item must expose us to risk and the related derivative instrument must reduce the exposure to that risk and
meet specific hedge documentation requirements related to designation dates, expectations for hedge effectiveness and the
probability that hedged future transactions will occur as forecasted.  We formally designate derivative instruments as hedges and
document and assess their effectiveness at inception of the hedge and on a monthly basis thereafter.  Forecasted transactions are
evaluated for the probability of occurrence and are periodically back-tested once the forecasted period has passed to determine
whether forecasted transactions are probable of occurring in the future.
We are required to recognize derivative instruments at fair value as either assets or liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets
unless such instruments meet certain normal purchase/normal sale criteria.  While all derivatives are required to be reported at fair
value on the balance sheet, changes in fair value of derivative instruments are reported in different ways, depending on the nature
and effectiveness of the hedging activities to which they relate.  After meeting specified conditions, a qualified derivative may be
designated as a total or partial hedge of:
•Changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability, or an unrecognized firm commitment – In a fair value hedge, gains
and losses for both the derivative instrument and the hedged item are recognized in income during the period of change.
•Variable cash flows of a forecasted transaction – In a cash flow hedge, the change in the fair value of the hedge is reported in
other comprehensive income (loss) and is reclassified to earnings when the forecasted transaction affects earnings.
An effective hedge relationship is one in which the change in fair value of a derivative instrument can be expected to offset 80% to
125% of the changes in fair value of a hedged item at inception and throughout the life of the hedging relationship.  The effective
portion of a hedge relationship is the amount by which the derivative instrument exactly offsets the change in fair value of the
hedged item during the reporting period.
F-13
Table of Contents
A contract designated as a cash flow hedge of an anticipated transaction that is not probable of occurring is immediately recognized
in earnings.
Certain of our derivative instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment; therefore, these instruments are accounted for
using mark-to-market accounting.
For certain physical forward commodity derivative contracts, we apply the normal purchase/normal sale exception, whereby
changes in the mark-to-market values of such contracts are not recognized in income.  As a result, the revenues and expenses
associated with such physical transactions are recognized during the period when volumes are physically delivered or
received.  Physical forward commodity contracts subject to this exception are evaluated for the probability of future delivery and
are periodically back-tested once the forecasted period has passed to determine whether similar forward contracts are probable of
physical delivery in the future.  See Note 14 for additional information regarding our derivative instruments.
Environmental Costs
Environmental costs for remediation are accrued based on estimates of known remediation requirements.  Such accruals are based
on management’s best estimate of the ultimate cost to remediate a site and are adjusted as further information and circumstances
develop.  Those estimates may change substantially depending on information about the nature and extent of contamination,
appropriate remediation technologies and regulatory approvals.  Expenditures to mitigate or prevent future environmental
contamination are capitalized.  Ongoing environmental compliance costs are charged to expense as incurred.  In accruing for
environmental remediation liabilities, costs of future expenditures for environmental remediation are not discounted to their present
value, unless the amount and timing of the expenditures are fixed or reliably determinable.  At December 31, 2022, none of our
estimated environmental remediation liabilities were discounted to present value since the ultimate amount and timing of cash
payments for such liabilities were not readily determinable.
The following table presents the activity of our environmental reserves for the years indicated:

At December 31, 2022 and 2021, $2 million and $3 million, respectively, of our environmental reserves were classified as current
liabilities.
Estimates
Preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates that affect amounts
presented in the financial statements.  Our most significant estimates relate to (i) the useful lives and depreciation/amortization
methods used for fixed and identifiable intangible assets; (ii) measurement of fair value and projections used in impairment testing
of fixed and intangible assets (including goodwill); (iii) contingencies; and (iv) revenue and expense accruals.
Actual results could differ materially from our estimates.  On an ongoing basis, we review our estimates based on currently
available information.  Any changes in the facts and circumstances underlying our estimates may require us to update such
estimates, which could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
F-14
Table of Contents
Fair Value Measurements
Our recurring and nonrecurring fair value estimates are based on either (i) actual market data or (ii) assumptions that other market
participants would use in pricing an asset or liability, including estimates of risk, in the principal market of the asset or liability at a
specified measurement date.  Recognized valuation techniques (such as the income or market approaches) employ inputs such as
contractual prices, quoted market prices or rates, operating costs, discount factors and business growth rates.  These inputs may be
either readily observable, corroborated by market data or generally unobservable.  In developing our estimates of fair value, we
endeavor to utilize the best information available and apply market-based data to the extent possible.  
A three-tier hierarchy has been established that classifies fair value amounts recognized in the financial statements based on the
observability of inputs used to estimate such fair values.  The hierarchy considers fair value amounts based on observable inputs
(Levels 1 and 2 fair value measures) to be more reliable and predictable than those based primarily on unobservable inputs (Level 3
fair value measures).  At each balance sheet reporting date, we categorize our financial assets and liabilities using this hierarchy. 
The characteristics of fair value amounts classified within each level of the hierarchy are described as follows:
•Level 1 fair value measures.  Level 1 fair values are based on quoted prices, which are available in active markets for identical
assets or liabilities as of the measurement date.  Active markets are defined as those in which transactions for identical assets or
liabilities occur with sufficient frequency so as to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis (e.g., transactions on the
New York Mercantile Exchange (“NYMEX”)).  Our Level 1 fair values consist of financial assets and liabilities such as
exchange-traded commodity derivative instruments.
•Level 2 fair value measures.  Level 2 fair values are based on pricing inputs other than quoted prices in active markets (a Level
1 fair value measure) and are either directly or indirectly observable as of the measurement date.  Level 2 fair values include
instruments that are valued using financial models or other appropriate valuation methodologies.  Such financial models are
primarily industry-standard models that consider various assumptions, including quoted forward prices for commodities, the
time value of money, volatility factors, current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments and other relevant
economic measures.  Substantially all of these assumptions (i) are observable in the marketplace throughout the full term of the
instrument; (ii) can be derived from observable data; or (iii) are validated by inputs other than quoted prices (e.g., interest rate
and yield curves at commonly quoted intervals).  Our Level 2 fair values primarily consist of commodity derivative
instruments such as forwards, swaps and other instruments transacted on an exchange or over-the-counter and interest rate
derivative instruments.  The fair values of these derivative instruments are based on observable price quotes for similar
products and locations.  The fair value of our interest rate derivatives are determined using financial models that incorporate
third-party yield curves for the same period as the future interest rate swap settlements.
•Level 3 fair value measures.  Level 3 fair values are based on unobservable inputs.  Unobservable inputs are used to measure
fair value to the extent that observable inputs are not available, thereby allowing for situations in which there is little, if any,
market activity for the asset or liability at the measurement date.  Unobservable inputs reflect management’s ideas about the
assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability (including assumptions about
risk).  Unobservable inputs are based on the best information available to us in the circumstances, which might include our
internally developed forecasts.  Level 3 inputs are typically used in connection with internally developed valuation
methodologies where we make our best estimate of fair value.  Valuations using Level 3 inputs are reviewed and approved by
members of senior management.
With regards to commodity derivatives, our Level 3 fair values primarily consist of the following commodity derivative
instruments used to hedge various inventories and transportation capacities: (i) NGL, crude, natural gas, refined products and
commercial energy-based contracts with terms greater than 36 months; (ii) over-the-counter options; and (iii) exchange traded
options with terms greater than one year.  In addition, we often rely on price quotes from reputable brokers who publish price
quotes on certain products and compare these prices to other reputable brokers for the same products in the same markets
whenever possible.  These prices, when combined with data from our commodity derivative instruments, are used in our
models to determine the fair value of such instruments.
F-15
Table of Contents
Our nonrecurring fair value estimates are generally based on the income approach to fair value and reflect various Level 3
inputs.  In many cases, there are no active markets (a Level 1 fair value measure) to rely on or other similar recent transactions
(a Level 2 fair value measure) to compare to. Our nonrecurring fair value estimates often include management’s expectations
of the residual market values for the underlying assets based on their knowledge and experience in the industry (a Level 3 fair
value measure). Other examples of Level 3 inputs used in the valuation models include anticipated gross operating margins,
throughput or processing volumes, utilization factors, sustaining capital expenditures, discount rates and business growth
rates.  When probability weights are used in cash flow modeling, the weights are generally obtained from management
personnel having oversight responsibilities for the assets being tested.  
Impairment Testing
The following table summarizes our asset impairment charges by type as presented on our Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows
for the years indicated:

Total asset impairment charges  $ 53  $ 233  $ 890 
(1)Primarily represents the write-down of surplus materials classified as current assets and intangible assets other than goodwill.
Asset impairment charges related to operations are a component of “Third party and other costs” within the “Operating costs and
expenses” section of our Statements of Consolidated Operations.
The following information describes our accounting policies regarding impairment testing for major asset categories:
•Impairment Testing for Long-Lived Assets.  Long-lived assets, which consist of intangible assets with finite lives and property,
plant and equipment, are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount
of such assets may not be recoverable.  Long-lived assets with carrying values that are not expected to be recovered through
future cash flows are written down to their estimated fair values.  The carrying value of a long-lived asset is deemed not
recoverable if it exceeds the sum of undiscounted estimated cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition
of the asset.  If the asset’s carrying value exceeds the sum of its undiscounted cash flows, a non-cash asset impairment charge
equal to the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its estimated fair value is recorded.  Fair value is defined as the price that
would be received to sell an asset or be paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at a
specified measurement date.  We measure fair value using market price indicators or, in the absence of such data, appropriate
valuation techniques.  See Note 4 for information regarding impairment charges attributable to property, plant and equipment.
•Impairment Testing for Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates. We evaluate our equity method investments for impairment
when there are events or changes in circumstances that indicate there is a potential loss in value of the investment attributable
to an other-than-temporary decline.  Examples of such events or changes in circumstances include continuing operating losses
of the entity and/or long-term negative changes in the entity’s industry.  In the event we determine that the value of an
investment is not recoverable due to an other-than-temporary decline, we record a non-cash impairment charge to adjust the
carrying value of the investment to its estimated fair value.  We did not record any non-cash impairment charges related to our
equity method investments during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 or 2020.  See Note 5 for information regarding
our equity method investments.

•Impairment Testing for Goodwill.  Goodwill, which represents the cost of an acquired business in excess of the fair value of its
net assets at the acquisition date, is subject to annual impairment testing in the fourth quarter of each year or when events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the goodwill may not be recoverable.  We test goodwill for
impairment at the reporting unit (or operating segment) level following guidance in ASU 2017-04, “Intangibles - Goodwill and
Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment,” the provisions of which we adopted on January 1, 2020.
Goodwill impairment charges represent the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying value (including its respective
goodwill) exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill.
We determine the fair value of each reporting unit using accepted valuation techniques, primarily through the use of discounted
cash flows (i.e., an income approach to fair value) supplemented by market-based assessments, if available.  The estimated fair
values of our reporting units incorporate assumptions regarding the future economic prospects of the assets and operations that
comprise each reporting unit including: (i) discrete financial forecasts for the assets comprising the reporting unit, which, in
turn, rely on management’s estimates of long-term operating margins, throughput volumes, capital investments and similar
factors; (ii) long-term growth rates for the reporting unit’s cash flows beyond the discrete forecast period; and (iii) appropriate
discount rates.  The fair value estimates are based on Level 3 inputs of the fair value hierarchy.  We believe that the
assumptions we use in estimating reporting unit fair values are consistent with those that market participants would use in their
fair value estimation process.  However, due to uncertainties in the estimation process and volatility in the supply and demand
for hydrocarbons and similar risk factors, actual results could differ significantly from our estimates.  Based on our most recent
goodwill impairment test at December 31, 2022, the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units was substantially in
excess of its carrying value (i.e., by at least 10%).
In December 2020, management determined that the carrying value of our natural gas pipelines and services reporting unit
exceeded its estimated fair value. This reporting unit, which reflects the operations of our Natural Gas Pipelines & Services
business segment, includes our natural gas gathering and transmission pipelines, storage facilities and related marketing
activities.  The long-term outlook for natural gas production in certain supply basins such as the Rocky Mountains and East
Texas is expected to remain lower for longer due to reduced drilling activity. In addition, the decline in pipeline revenues
attributable to lower regional natural gas price spreads is expected to adversely impact the future cash flows of our
transmission pipelines. These factors, coupled with an increase in the estimated rate of return required for such businesses by
market participants, resulted in the fair value of this reporting unit being less than its carrying value at December 31, 2020. 
The resulting goodwill impairment charge of $296 million represents the entire amount of goodwill attributable to this
reporting unit and is reflected as a component of operating costs and expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 as
presented on our Statements of Consolidated Operations.  We did not record any non-cash goodwill impairment charges during
the years ended December 31, 2022 or 2021.  See Note 6 for additional information regarding our goodwill. 
Inventories
Inventories primarily consist of NGLs, petrochemicals, refined products, crude oil and natural gas volumes that are valued at the
lower of cost or net realizable value.  We capitalize, as a cost of inventory, shipping and handling charges (e.g., pipeline
transportation and storage fees) and other related costs associated with purchased volumes.  As volumes are sold and delivered out
of inventory, the cost of these volumes (including freight-in charges that have been capitalized as part of inventory cost) are
charged to operating costs and expenses.  Shipping and handling fees associated with products we sell and deliver to customers are
charged to operating costs and expenses as incurred.  See Note 3 for additional information regarding our inventories.
Leases
We account for our leases under Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 842, Leases, which requires substantially all leases be
recorded on the balance sheet.
F-17
Table of Contents
The standard includes two lessee accounting models, which results in a lease being classified as either a “finance” or “operating”
lease based on whether the lessee effectively obtains control of the underlying asset during the lease term.  A lease would be
classified as a finance lease if it meets one of five classification criteria.  By default, a lease that does not meet the criteria to be
classified as a finance lease will be deemed an operating lease.  Regardless of classification, the initial measurement of both lease
types will result in the balance sheet recognition of a right-of-use (“ROU”) asset (representing a company’s right to use the
underlying asset for a specified period of time) and a corresponding lease liability.  The lease liability will be recognized at the
present value of the future lease payments, and the ROU asset will equal the lease liability adjusted for any prepaid rent, lease
incentives provided by the lessor, and any indirect costs.
The subsequent measurement of each type of lease varies. For finance leases, a lessee will amortize the ROU asset (generally on a
straight-line basis in a manner similar to depreciation) and accrete the lease liability (as a component of interest expense) using the
effective interest method.  Operating leases will result in the recognition of a single lease expense amount that is recorded on a
straight-line basis.
We do not recognize ROU assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases, which are leases with a maximum term of 12 months or
less and do not include a purchase option that the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise, and instead recognize lease payments on a
straight-line basis.  In addition, we combine lease and non-lease components relating to our office and warehouse leases, as
applicable.
See Note 17 for our disclosures regarding operating lease obligations.
Property, Plant and Equipment
Property, plant and equipment is recorded at cost.  Expenditures for additions, improvements and other enhancements to property,
plant and equipment are capitalized, and minor replacements, maintenance, and repairs that do not extend asset life or add value are
charged to expense as incurred.  When property, plant and equipment assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the related cost
and accumulated depreciation is removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is included in results of operations for
the respective period.
We capitalize interest costs incurred on funds used to construct property, plant and equipment while the asset is in its construction
phase.  The capitalized interest is recorded as part of the asset to which it relates and is amortized over the asset’s estimated useful
life as a component of depreciation expense.  When capitalized interest is recorded, it reduces interest expense from what it would
be otherwise.
In general, depreciation is the systematic and rational allocation of an asset’s cost, less its residual value (if any), to the periods it
benefits.  The majority of our property, plant and equipment is depreciated using the straight-line method, which results in
depreciation expense being incurred evenly over the life of an asset.  Our estimate of depreciation expense incorporates
management assumptions regarding the useful economic lives and residual values of our assets.  With respect to midstream energy
assets such as natural gas gathering systems that are reliant upon a specific natural resource basin for throughput volumes, the
anticipated useful economic life of such assets may be limited by the estimated life of the associated natural resource basin from
which the assets derive benefit.  Our forecast of the remaining life for the applicable resource basins is based on several factors,
including information published by the U.S. Energy Information Administration.  Where appropriate, we use other depreciation
methods (generally accelerated) for tax purposes.
Leasehold improvements are recorded as a component of property, plant and equipment.  The cost of leasehold improvements is
charged to earnings using the straight-line method over the shorter of (i) the remaining lease term or (ii) the estimated useful lives
of the improvements.  We consider renewal terms that are deemed reasonably assured when estimating remaining lease terms.
Our assumptions regarding the useful economic lives and residual values of our assets may change in response to new facts and
circumstances, which would prospectively impact our depreciation expense amounts.  Examples of such circumstances include, but
are not limited to: (i) changes in laws and regulations that limit the estimated economic life of an asset; (ii) changes in technology
that render an asset obsolete; (iii) changes in expected salvage values or (iv) significant changes in the forecast life of the applicable
resource basins, if any.

Table of Contents
Certain of our plant facilities undergo periodic planned outages for major maintenance activities.  The method of accounting for
these activities depends on whether the plant utilizes either a distillation-based or reaction-based process.  Our natural gas
processing plants, NGL fractionators, deisobutanizers, propylene splitters and similar facilities utilize thermal distillation processes
to separate hydrocarbons into more useful components. Our reaction-based plants, which primarily include our PDH, isomerization
and octane enhancement facilities, utilize catalysts to facilitate chemical reactions that convert lower value hydrocarbons into
higher value products.  We use the expense-as-incurred method to account for the planned major maintenance activities of
distillation-based plants.  For reaction-based plants, we use the deferral method when accounting for major maintenance activities. 
Under the deferral method, major maintenance costs are capitalized and amortized over the period until the next major overhaul
project.  We adopted the deferral method for our reaction-based plants in November 2020.  Historically, the costs of major
maintenance activities attributable to our reaction-based facilities, principally our octane enhancement assets, were not material to
our consolidated financial statements.
With regard to the planned major maintenance activities of our marine transportation assets and underground storage caverns, we
continue to use the deferral method to account for such costs.
Asset retirement obligations (“AROs”) are legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets that result
from their acquisition, construction, development and/or normal operation.  When an ARO is incurred, we record a liability for the
ARO and capitalize an equal amount as an increase in the carrying value of the related long-lived asset.  ARO amounts are
measured at their estimated fair value using expected present value techniques.  Over time, the ARO liability is accreted to its
present value (through accretion expense) and the capitalized amount is depreciated over the remaining useful life of the related
long-lived asset.  We will incur a gain or loss to the extent that our ARO liabilities are not settled at their recorded amounts.
See Note 4 for additional information regarding our property, plant and equipment and AROs.
Revenues
Substantially all of our revenues are accounted for under ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, however, to a limited
extent, some revenues are accounted for under other guidance such as ASC 842, Leases, ASC 845, Nonmonetary Transactions, or
ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging Activities.
The core principle of ASC 606 is that a company should recognize revenue in a manner that fairly depicts the transfer of goods or
services to customers in amounts that reflect the consideration the company expects to receive for those goods or services.  We
apply this core principle by following five key steps outlined in ASC 606: (i) identify the contract; (ii) identify the performance
obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in
the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the performance obligation is satisfied. Each of these steps involves
management judgment and an analysis of the contract’s material terms and conditions.
Under ASC 606, we recognize revenue when or as we satisfy our performance obligation to the customer.  In situations where we
have recognized revenue, but have a conditional right to consideration (based on something other than the passage of time) from
the customer, we recognize unbilled revenue (a contract asset) on our consolidated balance sheet.  Unbilled revenue is reclassified
to accounts receivable when we have an unconditional right of payment from the customer. Payments received from customers in
advance of the period in which we satisfy a performance obligation are recorded as deferred revenue (a contract liability) on our
consolidated balance sheet.
F-19
Table of Contents
Our revenue streams are derived from the sale of products and providing midstream services.  Revenues from the sale of products
are recognized at a point in time, which represents the transfer of control (and the satisfaction of our performance obligation under
the contract) to the customer.  From that point forward, the customer is able to direct the use of, and obtain substantially all the
benefits from its use of, the products.  With respect to midstream services (e.g., interruptible transportation), we satisfy our
performance obligations over time and recognize revenues when the services are provided and the customer receives the benefits
based on an output measure of volumes redelivered.  We believe this measure is a faithful depiction of the transfer of control for
midstream services since there is (i) an insignificant period of time between the receipt of customers’ volumes and their subsequent
redelivery, and (ii) it is not possible to individually track and differentiate customers’ inventories as they traverse our facilities.  For
stand-ready performance obligations (e.g., a storage capacity reservation contract), we recognize revenues over time on a straight-
line basis as time elapses over the term of the contract. We believe that these approaches accurately depict the transfer of benefits to
the customer.
Customers are invoiced for products purchased or services rendered when we have an unconditional right to consideration under
the associated contract. The consideration we are entitled to invoice may be either fixed, variable or a combination of both. 
Examples of fixed consideration would be fixed payments from customers under take-or-pay arrangements, storage capacity
reservation agreements and firm transportation contracts. Variable consideration represents payments from customers that are based
on factors that fluctuate (or vary) based on volumes, prices or both. Examples of variable consideration include interruptible
transportation agreements, market-indexed product sales contracts and the value of NGLs we retain under natural gas processing
agreements.  The terms of our billings are typical of the industry for the products we sell.
Under certain midstream service agreements, customers are required to provide a minimum volume over an agreed-upon period
with a provision that allows the customer to make-up any volume shortfalls over an agreed-upon period (referred to as “make-up
rights”).  Revenue pursuant to such agreements is initially deferred and subsequently recognized when either the make-up rights are
exercised, the likelihood of the customer exercising the rights becomes remote, or we are otherwise released from the performance
obligation.
Customers may contribute funds to us to help offset the construction costs related to pipeline construction activities and production
well tie-ins.  These receipts are recognized as additional service revenues over the term of the associated midstream services
provided to the customer.
For those contracts under which we have the ability to invoice the customer in an amount that corresponds directly with the value
of the performance obligation completed to date, we recognize revenue as we have the right to invoice.

In those instances where we take ownership of inventory volumes through percent-of-liquids contracts and similar arrangements (as
opposed to outright purchases from third parties for cash), these volumes are valued at market-based prices during the month in
which they are acquired.
The following table presents our total cost of sales amounts and lower of cost or net realizable value adjustments for the years
indicated:

Lower of cost or net realizable value adjustments recognized in cost of sales   19   20   60 
(1)Cost of sales is a component of “Operating costs and expenses,” as presented on our Statements of Consolidated Operations.  Fluctuations in these amounts are
primarily due to changes in energy commodity prices and sales volumes associated with our marketing activities.
Due to fluctuating commodity prices, we recognize lower of cost or net realizable value adjustments when the carrying value of our
available-for-sale inventories exceeds their net realizable value.  These non-cash charges are a component of cost of sales in the
period they are recognized.  To the extent our commodity hedging strategies address inventory-related price risks and are
successful, these inventory valuation adjustments are mitigated or offset.  See Note 14 for a description of our commodity hedging
activities.

Asset Retirement Obligations
We record AROs in connection with legal requirements to perform specified retirement activities under contractual arrangements
and/or governmental regulations.  Our contractual AROs primarily result from right-of-way agreements associated with our
pipeline operations and property leases associated with our plant sites.  In addition, we record AROs in connection with
governmental regulations associated with the abandonment or retirement of above-ground brine storage pits and certain marine
vessels.  We also record AROs in connection with regulatory requirements associated with the renovation or demolition of certain
assets containing hazardous substances such as asbestos.  We typically fund our AROs using cash flow from operations.
Property, plant and equipment at December 31, 2022 and 2021 includes $117 million and $81 million, respectively, of asset
retirement costs capitalized as an increase in the associated long-lived asset.

(4)2021 and 2020 amounts include non-cash impairment charges of $113 million and $252 million, respectively, associated with our marine transportation
business.
The following information summarizes our significant asset impairment charges involving property, plant and equipment that were
recognized during the year ended December 31, 2021:
•In December 2021, we evaluated our marine transportation business for impairment due to a further deterioration of demand
for such services, which resulted in lower-than-expected term and spot rates.  As a result of our review, we recognized an
impairment charge of $114 million.  The impairment charge reduced property, plant and equipment by $113 million and
intangible assets by $1 million.  We determined the fair value using an income approach (i.e., a discounted cash flow
approach), which incorporates Level 3 inputs including: (i) management’s long-term forecast of cash flows generated by the
business; (ii) a discount rate of 8.7%, which is based on an estimated weighted-average cost of capital for market participants
engaged in similar business activities; and (iii) a growth rate of 2.2% for terminal year cash flows.
•In March 2021, we entered into agreements to sell a coal bed natural gas gathering system and related Val Verde treating
facility, both of which were components of our San Juan Gathering System, to a third party for $39 million in cash.  The
transaction closed and was effective on April 1, 2021.  We recognized an impairment charge of $44 million attributable to this
transaction, which reflects the write down of $37 million of property, plant and equipment and $7 million of intangible assets
to their respective fair values.
The following information summarizes our significant asset impairment charges involving property, plant and equipment that were
recognized during the year ended December 31, 2020:
•In December 2020, we evaluated our marine transportation business for impairment due to a lower demand outlook for such
services. As a result of our review, we recognized an impairment charge of $257 million, which reduced property, plant and
equipment by $252 million and intangible assets by $5 million. We determined the fair value using an income approach (i.e., a
discounted cash flow approach), which incorporates several Level 3 inputs including: (i) management’s long-term forecast of
cash flows generated by the business; (ii) a discount rate of 9.3%, which is based on an estimated weighted-average cost of
capital for market participants engaged in similar business activities; and (iii) a growth rate of 2.1% for terminal year cash
flows.
•In December 2020, we evaluated certain of our natural gas gathering and processing assets in South Texas for impairment due
to a lower production outlook.  As a result of our review, we recognized an aggregate impairment charge of $126 million,
which reduced property, plant and equipment by $125 million and intangible assets by $1 million.  The natural gas assets
impacted by this review were our Armstrong, Gilmore, Shilling and Indian Springs natural gas processing facilities and our
Indian Springs and Big Thicket Gathering Systems.  We determined the fair value using Level 3 inputs which were based
primarily on management expectations of the residual values of such facilities and pipelines based on historical experience.

•In September 2020, we recognized $42 million of impairment expense due to our cancellation of the Midland-to-ECHO 4
Pipeline construction project. 
The remainder of our impairment charges for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 are attributable to the complete
write-off of assets that are no longer expected to be used or constructed.

Customer relationship intangible assets
Customer relationship intangible assets represent the estimated economic value assigned to commercial relationships acquired in
connection with business combinations.  Our customer relationship intangible assets are classified as either (i) basin-specific or (ii)
general. Basin-specific customer relationships represent access to customers associated with a defined resource basin (e.g.,
customers using a natural gas gathering system serving a specific production field) and is analogous to having a franchise in a
particular area.  General customer relationships are associated with customers whose hydrocarbon volumes are not attributable to
specific resource basins (e.g., customers at a marine terminal that handles volumes originating from multiple sources).
The estimated fair value of each customer relationship intangible asset was determined at the time of acquisition using a discounted
cash flow analysis, which incorporates various assumptions regarding the acquired business.  The assumptions may include Level 3
fair value inputs, including long-range cash flow forecasts that extend for the estimated economic life of the hydrocarbon resource
base served by the asset network, anticipated service contract renewals, resource base depletion rates and expected customer
attrition rates.
F-26
Table of Contents
The recognition of customer relationships are supported by a variety of factors.  In general, midstream infrastructure requires a
significant investment, both in terms of initial construction costs and ongoing maintenance, and is generally supported by long-term
contracts that establish a customer base.  The level of expenditures and regulatory requirements involved in constructing new
midstream asset networks can create significant economic barriers to entry that may limit potential competition.  Furthermore,
efficient, continuous operation of the acquired fixed assets not only supports the commercial relationships existing at the time of the
acquisition, but it provides us with opportunities to establish new ones.  These factors support the long-term value attributed to our
customer relationship intangible assets.
With respect to amortization periods, the duration of a basin-specific customer relationship is limited to the estimated economic life
of the associated resource basin.  The duration of our other customer relationships is typically limited to the term of the underlying
service contracts, including assumed renewals.  Amortization expense attributable to customer relationships is recorded in a manner
that closely resembles the pattern in which we expect to benefit from such relationships.
At December 31, 2022, the carrying value of our portfolio of customer relationship intangible assets was $2.8 billion, the principal

Variable Interest Rates
The following table presents the range of interest rates and weighted-average interest rates paid on our consolidated variable-rate
debt during the year ended December 31, 2022:
 Range of Interest

Commercial Paper Notes 0.20% to 4.65% 2.07%
EPO Junior Subordinated Notes C and TEPPCO Junior Subordinated Notes 2.95% to 7.54% 4.51%
EPO Junior Subordinated Notes D 5.91% to 7.63% 6.43%
Amounts borrowed under EPO’s September 2022 $1.5 Billion 364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement and September 2021 $3.0
Billion Multi-Year Revolving Credit Agreement bear interest, at EPO’s election, equal to: (i) the Secured Overnight Financing Rate
("SOFR") or LIBOR, as applicable, plus an additional variable spread; or (ii) an alternate base rate, which is the greatest of (a) the
Prime Rate in effect on such day, (b) the Federal Funds Effective Rate in effect on such day plus 0.5%, or (c) Adjusted Term SOFR
or LIBOR, as applicable, for an interest period of one month in effect on such day plus 1%, and a variable spread. The applicable
spreads are determined based on EPO's debt ratings.
In July 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority in the U.K. announced a desire to phase out LIBOR as a benchmark by the end of
June 2023.  Financial industry working groups are developing replacement rates and methodologies to transition existing
agreements that depend on LIBOR as a reference rate.  We currently do not expect the transition from LIBOR to have a material
financial impact on us.
Scheduled Maturities of Debt

EPO Debt Obligations
Commercial Paper Notes
EPO maintains a commercial paper program under which it may issue (and have outstanding at any time) up to $3.0 billion in
aggregate principal amount of short-term notes.  As a back-stop to the program, we intend to maintain a minimum aggregate
available borrowing capacity under EPO’s revolving credit facilities equal to the aggregate amount outstanding under our
commercial paper notes.  All commercial paper notes issued under the program are senior unsecured obligations of EPO that are
unconditionally guaranteed by the Partnership.  As of December 31, 2022, EPO had $495 million aggregate principal amount of
short-term notes outstanding under its commercial paper program.
September 2022 $1.5 Billion 364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement
In September 2022, EPO entered into a new $1.5 billion 364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement (the “September 2022 $1.5 Billion
364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement”) that replaced its September 2021 364-day revolving credit agreement.  There were no
principal amounts outstanding under the September 2021 364-day revolving credit agreement when it was replaced by the
September 2022 $1.5 Billion 364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement.  At December 31, 2022, there were no principal amounts
outstanding under the September 2022 $1.5 Billion 364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement.
F-30
Table of Contents
Under the terms of the September 2022 $1.5 Billion 364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement, EPO may borrow up to $1.5 billion
(which may be increased by up to $200 million to $1.7 billion at EPO’s election, provided certain conditions are met) at a variable
interest rate for a term of up to 364 days, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein.  The September 2022 $1.5 Billion
364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement matures in September 2023.  To the extent that principal amounts are outstanding at the
maturity date, EPO may elect to have the entire principal balance then outstanding continued as non-revolving term loans for a
period of one additional year, payable in September 2024.  Borrowings under the September 2022 $1.5 Billion 364-Day Revolving
Credit Agreement may be used for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and general company purposes.
The September 2022 $1.5 Billion 364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, covenants
(affirmative and negative) and events of default, the occurrence of which would permit the lenders to accelerate the maturity date of
any amounts borrowed under this credit agreement.  The September 2022 $1.5 Billion 364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement also
restricts EPO’s ability to pay cash distributions to the Partnership, if an event of default (as defined in the credit agreement) has
occurred and is continuing at the time such distribution is scheduled to be paid or would result therefrom.
EPO’s obligations under the September 2022 $1.5 Billion 364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement are not secured by any collateral;
however, they are guaranteed by the Partnership.
September 2021 $3.0 Billion Multi-Year Revolving Credit Agreement
In September 2021, EPO entered into a new $3.0 billion multi-year revolving credit agreement that matures in September 2026 (the
“September 2021 $3.0 Billion Multi-Year Revolving Credit Agreement”).  The September 2021 $3.0 Billion Multi-Year Revolving
Credit Agreement replaced EPO’s prior multi-year revolving credit agreement that was scheduled to mature in September 2024. 
There were no principal amounts outstanding under the prior multi-year revolving credit agreement when it was replaced by the
September 2021 $3.0 Billion Multi-Year Revolving Credit Agreement.  At December 31, 2022, there were no principal amounts
outstanding under the September 2021 $3.0 Billion Multi-Year Revolving Credit Agreement.
Under the terms of the September 2021 $3.0 Billion Multi-Year Revolving Credit Agreement, EPO may borrow up to $3.0 billion
(which may be increased by up to $500 million to $3.5 billion at EPO’s election provided certain conditions are met) at a variable
interest rate for a term of five years, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein.  Borrowings under the September 2021
$3.0 Billion Multi-Year Revolving Credit Agreement may be used for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and
general company purposes.
The September 2021 $3.0 Billion Multi-Year Revolving Credit Agreement contains customary representations, warranties,
covenants (affirmative and negative) and events of default, the occurrence of which would permit the lenders to accelerate the
maturity date of any amounts borrowed under this credit agreement.  The September 2021 $3.0 Billion Multi-Year Revolving
Credit Agreement also restricts EPO’s ability to pay cash distributions to the Partnership, if an event of default (as defined in the
credit agreement) has occurred and is continuing at the time such distribution is scheduled to be paid or would result therefrom.
EPO’s obligations under the September 2021 $3.0 Billion Multi-Year Revolving Credit Agreement are not secured by any
collateral; however, they are guaranteed by the Partnership.
Senior Notes
EPO’s fixed-rate senior notes are unsecured obligations of EPO that rank equal with its existing and future unsecured and
unsubordinated indebtedness.  They are senior to any existing and future subordinated indebtedness of EPO.  EPO’s senior notes
are subject to make-whole redemption rights and were issued under indentures containing certain covenants, which generally
restrict its ability (with certain exceptions) to incur debt secured by liens and engage in sale and leaseback transactions.  In total,
EPO issued $1.0 billion and $4.3 billion of senior notes during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.  EPO
did not issue any senior notes during the year ended December 31, 2022.
In February 2022, EPO repaid all of the $750 million and $650 million in principal amount of its Senior Notes VV and CC,
respectively, using remaining cash on hand attributable to its September 2021 senior notes offering and proceeds from issuances
under its commercial paper program.
F-31
Table of Contents
EPO’s senior notes are unconditionally guaranteed on an unsecured and unsubordinated basis by the Partnership.
See Note 20, Subsequent Event, for information regarding the issuance of Senior Notes FFF and GGG in January 2023.
EPO Junior Subordinated Notes
EPO’s payment obligations under its junior subordinated notes (“junior notes”) are subordinated to all of its current and future
senior indebtedness.  The indenture agreement governing the junior notes allows EPO to defer interest payments on one or more
occasions for up to ten consecutive years subject to certain conditions.  Subject to certain exceptions, during any period in which
interest payments are deferred, neither the Partnership nor EPO can declare or make any distributions on any of our respective
equity securities or make any payments on indebtedness or other obligations that rank equal with or are subordinate to the junior
notes.  Each series of EPO’s junior notes rank equal with each other and generally are not redeemable by EPO while such notes
bear interest at a fixed annual rate.
In connection with the issuance of EPO’s Junior Subordinated Notes C, EPO entered into a Replacement Capital Covenant in favor
of covered debt holders (as defined in the underlying documents) pursuant to which EPO agreed, for the benefit of such debt
holders, that it would not redeem or repurchase such junior notes unless such redemption or repurchase is made using proceeds
from the issuance of certain securities.
In August 2022, EPO redeemed $350 million of the $700 million outstanding principal amount of its Junior Subordinated Notes D
at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes being redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon
to, but not including, the redemption date.  The redemption was funded using cash on hand and proceeds from issuances under
EPO’s commercial paper program.
EPO’s junior notes are unconditionally guaranteed on an unsecured and subordinated basis by the Partnership.
Letters of Credit
At December 31, 2022, EPO had $83 million of letters of credit outstanding primarily related to our commodity hedging activities.
Lender Financial Covenants
We were in compliance with the financial covenants of our consolidated debt agreements at December 31, 2022.
Parent-Subsidiary Guarantor Relationships
The Partnership acts as guarantor of the consolidated debt obligations of EPO, with the exception of the remaining debt obligations
of TEPPCO.  If EPO were to default on any of its guaranteed debt, the Partnership would be responsible for full and unconditional
repayment of such obligations.

Common units outstanding at December 31, 2022   2,170,806,347 
The Partnership’s common units represent limited partner interests that give the holders thereof the right to participate in
distributions and to exercise the other rights or privileges available to them under our Seventh Amended and Restated Agreement of
Limited Partnership (as amended from time to time, the “Partnership Agreement”).  In accordance with the Partnership Agreement,
capital accounts are maintained for our limited partners.  The capital account provisions of our Partnership Agreement incorporate
principles established for U.S. federal income tax purposes and are not comparable to the equity balances presented in our
consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.  Partnership earnings and cash distributions are allocated to
holders of our common units in accordance with their respective percentage interests.
Registration Statements
We have a universal shelf registration statement (the “2021 Shelf”) on file with the SEC which allows the Partnership and EPO
(each on a standalone basis) to issue an unlimited amount of equity and debt securities, respectively.  The 2021 Shelf replaced our
prior universal shelf registration statement, which was set to expire in March 2022.
In addition, the Partnership has a registration statement on file with the SEC covering the issuance of up to $2.5 billion of its
common units in amounts, at prices and on terms based on market conditions and other factors at the time of such offerings
(referred to as the Partnership’s at-the-market (“ATM”) program).  The Partnership did not issue any common units under its ATM
program during the three years ended December 31, 2022.  The Partnership’s capacity to issue additional common units under the
ATM program remains at $2.5 billion as of December 31, 2022.
We may issue additional equity and debt securities to assist us in meeting our future liquidity requirements, including those related
to capital investments.

Issuance of Common Units due to Settlement of Liquidity Option in March 2020
In October 2014, we acquired approximately 65.9% of the limited partner interests of Oiltanking Partners, L.P. (“Oiltanking”), all
of the member interests of OTLP GP, LLC, the general partner of Oiltanking (“Oiltanking GP”), and the incentive distribution
rights held by Oiltanking GP from Oiltanking Holding Americas, Inc. (currently known as OTA Holdings, Inc., “OTA”), a U.S.
corporation, as the first step (“Step 1”) of a two-step acquisition of Oiltanking.  In February 2015, we completed the second step of
this transaction consisting of the acquisition of the noncontrolling interests in Oiltanking.  In order to fund the equity consideration
paid in Step 1 of the Oiltanking acquisition, we issued 54,807,352 common units to OTA on October 1, 2014 in a transaction
exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), pursuant to Section 4(a)
(2) thereof.  We also entered into a put option agreement (the “Liquidity Option Agreement” or “Liquidity Option”) with OTA and
Marquard & Bahls AG (“M&B”), a German corporation and the ultimate parent company of OTA, in connection with Step 1. 
Under the Liquidity Option Agreement, we granted M&B the option to sell to the Partnership 100% of the issued and outstanding
capital stock of OTA at any time within a 90-day period commencing on February 1, 2020.
On February 25, 2020, the Partnership received notice of M&B’s election to exercise its rights under the Liquidity Option
Agreement.  On March 5, 2020, the Partnership settled its obligations under the Liquidity Option Agreement by issuing 54,807,352
new common units to Skyline North Americas, Inc. (“Skyline,” an affiliate of M&B) in exchange for the capital stock of OTA. As a
result of the settlement, OTA became a consolidated subsidiary of ours and we indirectly acquired the 54,807,352 Partnership
common units owned by OTA and assumed all future income tax obligations of OTA, including its deferred tax liability.
As a result of the Liquidity Option settlement, the partners’ equity balance for common units (as presented on our Consolidated
Balance Sheet) increased by $1.3 billion, representing the market value of the 54,807,352 Partnership common units issued to
Skyline on March 5, 2020 at a closing price of $23.67 per unit.  Since OTA did not meet the definition of a business as described in
ASC 805, Business Combinations, the OTA transaction was accounted for by the Partnership as the reacquisition of common units
and the assumption of OTA’s related deferred tax liability.  In consolidation, we present the common units owned by OTA as
treasury units, with their historical cost equal to the $1.3 billion market value of the Partnership common units issued to Skyline. 
On September 30, 2020, OTA exchanged the common units it holds for preferred units issued by the Partnership.  For information
regarding the preferred units and exchange transaction, see “Redeemable Preferred Limited Partner Interests” within this Note 8.
The common units issued to Skyline upon settlement of the Liquidity Option constitute “restricted securities” in the meaning of
Rule 144 under the Securities Act and may not be resold except pursuant to an effective registration statement or an available
exemption under the Securities Act.  In connection with the settlement of the Liquidity Option, the Partnership entered into a
Registration Rights Agreement (the “Registration Rights Agreement”) with Skyline. Pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement,
Skyline has the right to request that the Partnership prepare and file a registration statement to permit and otherwise facilitate the
public resale of all or a portion of the Partnership’s common units owned by Skyline and its affiliates.  The Partnership’s obligation
to Skyline to effect such transactions is limited to five registration statements and underwritten offerings.  In May 2020, the
Partnership filed a registration statement on behalf of Skyline for the resale of up to 54,807,352 common units. This registration
statement is effective and, in June 2020, the Partnership filed a prospectus supplement to this registration statement that allows
Skyline to sell up to $500 million of the Partnership’s common units it owns in connection with an “at-the-market” program that it
administers.  We do not receive any proceeds from such offerings.
Upon settlement of the Liquidity Option on March 5, 2020, the Liquidity Option liability was effectively replaced by the deferred
tax liability of OTA as calculated in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes.  See Note 16 for additional information regarding
OTA’s deferred tax liability.
Common Unit Repurchases Under 2019 Buyback Program
In January 2019, we announced that the Board of Enterprise GP had approved a $2.0 billion multi-year unit buyback program (the
“2019 Buyback Program”), which provides the Partnership with an additional method to return capital to investors.  The 2019
Buyback Program authorizes the Partnership to repurchase its common units from time to time, including through open market
purchases and negotiated transactions.  No time limit has been set for completion of the program, and it may be suspended or
discontinued at any time.
F-34
Table of Contents
The Partnership repurchased 10,166,923 and 9,891,956 common units under the 2019 Buyback Program through open market
purchases during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.  The total cost of these repurchases, including
commissions and fees, was $250 million and $214 million, respectively.  During the year ended December 31, 2020, the
Partnership repurchased 8,978,317 common units under the 2019 Buyback Program through open market and private purchases for
a total cost, including commissions and fees, of $186 million.  Common units repurchased under the 2019 Buyback Program are
immediately cancelled upon acquisition.  At December 31, 2022, the remaining available capacity under the 2019 Buyback
Program was $1.3 billion.
Common Units Delivered Under DRIP and EUPP
The Partnership has a registration statement on file with the SEC authorizing the issuance or other delivery of our common units in
connection with a distribution reinvestment plan (“DRIP”).  The DRIP provides unitholders of record and beneficial owners of our
common units a voluntary means by which they can increase the number of our common units they own by reinvesting the
quarterly cash distributions they receive from us into the purchase of additional common units.  
In addition to the DRIP, we have registration statements on file with the SEC authorizing the issuance or other delivery of our
common units in connection with an employee unit purchase plan (“EUPP”).  In November 2022, our unitholders approved the
amendment and restatement of the EUPP.  As a result, the maximum aggregate number of common units that have been, or in the
future may be, delivered under the EUPP was increased from 8,000,000 common units to 23,000,000 common units, and the term
of the plan was extended to November 2032.
We have the sole discretion to determine whether common units purchased under the DRIP and EUPP will come from our
authorized but unissued common units or from common units purchased on the open market by each plan’s administrator.  During
each of the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Partnership used common units purchased on the open market,
rather than issuing new common units, to satisfy its delivery obligations under the DRIP and EUPP.  This election is subject to
change in future quarters depending on the Partnership’s need for equity capital.  Agents of the Partnership purchased 6,392,846,
6,363,197 and 6,982,963 common units on the open market and delivered them to participants in the DRIP and EUPP during the
years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.  Apart from $3 million, $3 million and $2 million attributable to the
plan discount available to all participants in the EUPP during 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, the funds used to effect these
purchases were sourced from the DRIP and EUPP participants.  No other Partnership funds were used to satisfy these obligations. 
We used open market purchases to satisfy DRIP and EUPP reinvestments in connection with the distribution paid on February 14,
2023.
After taking into account the number of common units delivered under the DRIP through December 31, 2022, we have the capacity
to deliver an additional 39,951,651 common units under this plan.  Likewise, we have the capacity to deliver an additional
16,226,159 common units under the EUPP. 
Common Units Issued in Connection With the Vesting of Phantom Unit Awards
After taking into account tax withholding requirements, the Partnership issued 4,571,333, 3,936,437 and 3,162,095 new common
units to employees in connection with the vesting of phantom unit awards during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and
2020, respectively.  See Note 13 for information regarding our phantom unit awards.

Redeemable Preferred Limited Partner Interests
The following table summarizes changes in the number of our preferred units outstanding since September 30, 2020:
Original issuance of preferred units outstanding on September 30, 2020   50,000 
Paid-in kind distribution to related party   138 
Preferred units outstanding at December 31, 2020   50,138

Preferred units outstanding at December 31, 2021   50,412 
Preferred units outstanding at December 31, 2022   50,412 
On September 30, 2020, the Partnership issued and sold an aggregate of 50,000 Series A Cumulative Convertible Preferred Units in
a private placement transaction.  The preferred units represent a new class of limited partner interests authorized under the
Partnership Agreement.  The stated value of each preferred unit is $1,000 per unit.  The total offering price for the preferred units
was $50 million, of which $32 million was received in cash with the remaining $18 million funded through the exchange of
1,120,588 of the Partnership’s common units owned by the purchasers.  Cash proceeds from the preferred unit offering include $15
million received from a privately held affiliate of EPCO for the purchase of 15,000 preferred units.  Offering expenses were
approximately $1 million.
Concurrently, the Partnership exchanged all of the 54,807,352 Partnership common units owned directly by OTA for 855,915 of the
Partnership’s new preferred units having an equivalent value.  The preferred units held by OTA, like the common units OTA held
prior to the exchange, are accounted for as treasury units by the Partnership in consolidation.  The historical cost of the treasury
units did not change as a result of the exchange and remains at the $1.3 billion recognized on March 5, 2020 in connection with
settlement of the Liquidity Option.
In March 2021, a privately held affiliate of EPCO sold its entire ownership interest in the Partnership’s preferred units to third
parties.
As described in the Partnership Agreement, key terms of the preferred units include the following:
•With respect to distribution and liquidation rights, the preferred units rank senior to the Partnership’s common units.
Preferred units held by persons other than the Partnership, its subsidiaries and its affiliates generally will vote on an as-
converted basis with the Partnership’s common units and have certain class voting rights with respect to certain protective
matters.
•Holders of the preferred units are entitled to receive cumulative quarterly distributions at a rate of 7.25% per annum. The
Partnership is prohibited from paying distributions on its common units unless full cumulative distributions on the preferred
units are paid or set aside for payment. The Partnership may satisfy its obligation to pay distributions to the preferred
unitholders through the issuance, in whole or in part, of additional preferred units (referred to as paid-in kind or “PIK”
distributions), with the remainder in cash, subject to certain rights of a holder to elect all cash and other conditions as
described in the Partnership Agreement.  The exchange by OTA of its common units for PIK-eligible preferred units enables
the Partnership to more effectively manage its consolidated cash balances.
In November 2020, the Partnership made its first quarterly distribution to third party and related party preferred unitholders. 
The distribution was valued at $1 million, consisting of PIK distributions of 138 new preferred units and less than $1 million
in cash.
During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Partnership made quarterly distributions to its third party and related party
preferred unitholders valued at $3 million, consisting of PIK distributions of 274 new preferred units and $3 million in cash.
During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Partnership made quarterly cash distributions to its preferred unitholders for
$3 million.

•Subject to certain limitations, each preferred unitholder may elect to convert its preferred units on or after September 30,
2025 into a number of the Partnership’s common units equal to (a) the number of preferred units to be converted multiplied
by (b) the quotient of (i) $1,000 plus any accrued and unpaid distributions per preferred unit, divided by (ii) 92.5% of the
volume-weighted average price of the Partnership’s common units at the time of conversion (as defined in the underlying
agreements). In addition, each preferred unitholder may convert its preferred units into common units if EPO’s senior notes
cease to have an investment grade rating or a Change of Control (as defined in the Partnership Agreement) occurs, in each
case based on the conversion ratio specified in the Partnership Agreement.
•The Partnership may elect to redeem the preferred units for cash, in whole or in part, based on a redemption price outlined in
the following schedule, plus any accrued and unpaid distributions at the redemption date:
•$1,100 per preferred unit from September 30, 2020 through September 29, 2022;
•$1,070 per preferred unit from September 30, 2022 through September 29, 2024;
•$1,030 per preferred unit from September 30, 2024 through September 29, 2025;
•$1,010 per preferred unit from September 30, 2025 through September 29, 2026; and
•$1,000 per preferred unit on or after September 30, 2026; however,
•if a Change of Control event occurs prior to September 30, 2026, the redemption price is $1,010 per preferred unit.
In connection with a redemption at the Partnership’s election, the Partnership may convert up to 50% of the preferred units
being redeemed into common units (and to pay cash with respect to the remainder), with each such preferred unit being
converted on the applicable redemption date into a number of common units equal to (i) the then-applicable preferred unit
redemption price divided by (ii) 92.5% of the volume-weighted average price of the Partnership’s common units at the time
of conversion (as defined in the underlying agreements).
The Partnership has agreed to prepare and file a registration statement that would permit or otherwise facilitate the public resale of
any common units resulting from the conversion of the preferred units to common units.
Our Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2022 presents the capital accounts of the third-party purchasers of the preferred
units as mezzanine equity since the terms of the preferred units allow for cash redemption by the holders in a Change of Control
event, without regard to the likelihood of such an event.  The preferred units held by OTA are presented as treasury units in
consolidation since their ultimate disposition remains under the control of the Partnership.
Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)
Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) primarily reflects cumulative gain or loss on derivative instruments designated
and qualified as cash flow hedges from inception less gains or losses previously reclassified from accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss) into earnings.  Gain or loss amounts related to cash flow hedges recorded in accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss) are reclassified to earnings in the same period(s) in which the underlying hedged forecasted
transactions affect earnings.  If it becomes probable that a forecasted transaction will not occur, the related net gain or loss in
accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) is immediately reclassified into earnings.

Total consolidated revenues  $ 58,186  $ 40,807  $ 27,200 
Substantially all of our revenues are derived from contracts with customers as defined within ASC 606.  The following information
describes the nature of our significant revenue streams by segment and type:
NGL Pipelines & Services
Sales of NGLs and related products
NGL marketing activities generate revenues from spot and term sales of NGLs and related products that we take title to through our
natural gas processing activities (i.e., our equity NGL production) and open market and long-term contract purchases.  Revenue
from these sales contracts is recognized when the NGLs are sold and delivered to customers at market-based prices.  
Midstream services
Natural gas processing utilizes service contracts that are either fee-based, commodity-based or a combination of the two.  When a
cash fee for natural gas processing services is stipulated by a contract, we record revenue when a producer’s natural gas has been
processed and redelivered.  Our commodity-based contracts include keepwhole, margin-band, percent-of-liquids, percent-of-
proceeds and contracts featuring a combination of commodity and fee-based terms.
F-40
Table of Contents
We recognize midstream service revenues in connection with the equity NGL-equivalents we receive under commodity-based
contracts (once the processing service has been performed and we are entitled to such volumes).  The value assigned to this non-
cash consideration and related inventory is based on the market value of the equity NGL-equivalents at the time the services are
performed. As noted previously, we also recognize product sales revenue, along with a corresponding cost of sales, when these
NGLs are delivered and sold to downstream customers under NGL marketing contracts.
NGL fractionation generates revenue using fee-based arrangements.  These fees are contractually subject to adjustment for changes
in certain fractionation expenses (e.g., fuel costs) and are recognized in the period services are provided.
NGL pipeline transportation contracts and tariffs generate revenue based on a fixed fee per gallon multiplied by the volume
transported and delivered (or capacity reserved).  Transportation fees charged to shippers are based on either tariffs regulated by
governmental agencies or contractual arrangements.  Under certain agreements, customers are required to ship a minimum volume
with a provision that allows the shipper to make-up any volume shortfalls over an agreed-upon period (referred to as “make-up
rights”).  Revenue attributable to such agreements is initially deferred and subsequently recognized at the earlier of when the
deficiency volume is shipped, when the likelihood of the shipper’s ability to meet the minimum volume commitment becomes
remote, or when the pipeline is otherwise released from its performance obligation.
NGL and related product storage contracts generate revenue from capacity reservations where we collect a fee for reserving storage
capacity for customers in our underground storage wells and above-ground storage tanks.  Under these agreements, revenue is
recognized on a straight-line basis over the reservation period.  In addition, we generally charge customers throughput fees based
on volumes delivered into and subsequently withdrawn from storage, which are recognized as the service is provided.
NGL import and export terminaling activities generate revenue in the period services are provided.  Customers are typically billed a
fee per unit of volume loaded or unloaded.  
Crude Oil Pipelines & Services
Sales of crude oil
Crude oil marketing activities generate revenues from the sale and delivery of crude oil purchased either directly from producers or
on the open market.  Revenue from these sales contracts is recognized when crude oil is sold and delivered to customers at market-
based prices.
Midstream services
Crude oil transportation contracts and tariffs generate revenue based upon a fixed fee per barrel multiplied by the volume
transported and delivered (or capacity reserved).  Transportation fees charged to shippers are based on either tariffs regulated by
governmental agencies or contractual arrangements.  Under certain agreements, customers are required to ship a minimum volume
over an agreed-upon period, with make-up rights.  Revenue attributable to such agreements is initially deferred and subsequently
recognized at the earlier of when the deficiency volume is shipped, when the likelihood of the shipper’s ability to meet the
minimum volume commitment becomes remote, or when the pipeline is otherwise released from its performance obligation.
Crude oil storage contracts generate revenue from capacity reservations where we collect a fee for reserving storage capacity for
customers at our terminals.  Under these agreements, revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the reservation period.  In
addition, customers are billed a fee per unit of volume handled at our terminals.  Revenue is recognized as the terminaling service is
provided.
Natural Gas Pipelines & Services
Sales of natural gas
Natural gas marketing activities generate revenue from the sale and delivery of natural gas purchased from producers, natural gas
processing facilities, and on the open market.  Revenue from these sales contracts is recognized when natural gas is sold and
delivered to customers at market-based prices.
F-41
Table of Contents
Midstream services
Natural gas transportation contracts generate revenues based on a fee per unit of volume transported multiplied by the volume
gathered or delivered.  Transportation fees charged to shippers are based on either tariffs regulated by governmental agencies or
contractual arrangements.  Revenues under transportation contracts are recognized when the volumes are transported and delivered
to customers.  In addition, certain of our natural gas pipelines offer firm capacity reservation services whereby the shipper pays a
contractual fee based on the level of throughput capacity reserved.  Revenues are recognized when the firm capacity services are
provided to the shipper.
Petrochemical & Refined Products Services
Sales of petrochemicals and refined products
Our petrochemical and refined products marketing activities generate revenue from the sale and delivery of products to customers
at market-based prices.  The products handled by these marketing groups include polymer grade propylene, octane additives, high
purity isobutylene and various refined products.
Midstream services
Propylene fractionation units and butane isomerization facilities generate revenue through fee-based tolling arrangements with
customers.  Revenue from such agreements is recognized in the period the services are provided.
Petrochemical and refined products transportation contracts generate revenue based upon a fixed fee per volume multiplied by the
volume transported and delivered.  Transportation fees charged to shippers are based on either tariffs regulated by governmental
agencies or contractual arrangements.
Marine transportation contracts generate revenue based on set day rates or a set fee per cargo movement recognized over the transit
time of individual tows.  Additionally, we record revenue for the costs of fuel and other operating costs that are directly reimbursed
by our marine customers.
Petrochemicals and refined products storage contracts generate revenue from capacity reservations where we collect a fee for
reserving storage capacity for customers at our terminals.  Under these agreements, revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis
over the reservation period.  In addition, customers are billed a fee per unit of volume handled at our terminals.  Revenue is
recognized as the terminaling service is provided.

(1)Unbilled revenues are transferred to accounts receivable once we have an unconditional right to consideration from the customer.  Deferred revenues are
recognized as revenue upon satisfaction of our performance obligation to the customer.
(2)Unbilled revenue represents revenue that has been recognized upon satisfaction of a performance obligation, but cannot be contractually invoiced (or billed) to
the customer at the balance sheet date until a future period.  Deferred revenue is recorded when payment is received from a customer prior to our satisfaction of
the associated performance obligation.
Remaining Performance Obligations
The following table presents estimated fixed future consideration from revenue contracts that contain minimum volume
commitments, deficiency and similar fees and the term of the contracts exceeds one year. These amounts represent the revenues we
expect to recognize in future periods from these contracts as of December 31, 2022.
For a significant portion of our revenue, we bill customers a contractual rate for the services provided multiplied by the amount of
volume handled in a given period.  We have the right to invoice the customer in the amount that corresponds directly with the value
of our performance completed to date.  Therefore, we are not required to disclose information about the variable consideration of
remaining performance obligations since we recognize revenue equal to the amount that we have the right to invoice.

Note 10.  Business Segments and Related Information
Segment Overview
Our operations are reported under four business segments: (i) NGL Pipelines & Services, (ii) Crude Oil Pipelines & Services, (iii)
Natural Gas Pipelines & Services and (iv) Petrochemical & Refined Products Services.  Our business segments are generally
organized and managed according to the types of services rendered (or technologies employed) and products produced and/or
sold.  
Financial information regarding these segments is evaluated regularly by our co-chief operating decision makers in deciding how to
allocate resources and in assessing our operating and financial performance.  The co-principal executive officers of our general
partner have been identified as our co-chief operating decision makers.  While these two officers evaluate results in a number of
different ways, the business segment structure is the primary basis for which the allocation of resources and financial results are
assessed.
The following information summarizes the assets and operations of each business segment:
•Our NGL Pipelines & Services business segment includes our natural gas processing and related NGL marketing activities,
NGL pipelines, NGL fractionation facilities, NGL and related product storage facilities, and NGL marine terminals.
•Our Crude Oil Pipelines & Services business segment includes our crude oil pipelines, crude oil storage and marine terminals,
and related crude oil marketing activities.  
•Our Natural Gas Pipelines & Services business segment includes our natural gas pipeline systems that provide for the
gathering, treating and transportation of natural gas.  This segment also includes our natural gas marketing activities.
•Our Petrochemical & Refined Products Services business segment includes our (i) propylene production facilities, which
include propylene fractionation units and a PDH facility, and related pipelines and marketing activities, (ii) butane
isomerization complex and related deisobutanizer operations, (iii) octane enhancement, iBDH and HPIB production facilities,
(iv) refined products pipelines, terminals and related marketing activities, (v) ethylene export terminal and related operations;
and (vi) marine transportation business.
Our plants, pipelines and other fixed assets are located in the U.S.
Segment Gross Operating Margin
We evaluate segment performance based on our financial measure of gross operating margin.  Gross operating margin is an
important performance measure of the core profitability of our operations and forms the basis of our internal financial
reporting.  We believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that our management uses in
evaluating segment results.  Gross operating margin is exclusive of other income and expense transactions, income taxes, the
cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles and extraordinary charges.  Gross operating margin is presented on a 100%
basis before any allocation of earnings to noncontrolling interests.  Our calculation of gross operating margin may or may not be
comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.
F-44
Table of Contents
The following table presents our measurement of total segment gross operating margin for the years indicated.  The GAAP
financial measure most directly comparable to total segment gross operating margin is operating income.
 For the Year Ended December 31,  
  2022   2021   2020  
Operating income  $ 6,907  $ 6,103  $ 5,035 
Adjustments to reconcile operating income to total segment gross operating margin
(addition or subtraction indicated by sign):             
   Depreciation, amortization and accretion expense in operating costs and expenses (1)   2,107   2,011   1,962 
   Asset impairment charges in operating costs and expenses   53   233   890 
   Net losses (gains) attributable to asset sales and related matters in operating costs and
 expenses   1   5   (4)
   General and administrative costs   241   209   220 
   Non-refundable payments received from shippers attributable to make-up rights (2)   144   85   118 
   Subsequent recognition of revenues attributable to make-up rights (3)   (97)  (138)  (33)
Total segment gross operating margin  $ 9,356  $ 8,508  $ 8,188 
(1)Excludes amortization of major maintenance costs for reaction-based plants, which are a component of gross operating margin.
(2)Since make-up rights entail a future performance obligation by the pipeline to the shipper, these receipts are recorded as deferred revenue for GAAP purposes;
however, these receipts are included in gross operating margin in the period of receipt since they are nonrefundable to the shipper.
(3)As deferred revenues attributable to make-up rights are subsequently recognized as revenue under GAAP, gross operating margin must be adjusted to remove
such amounts to prevent duplication since the associated non-refundable payments were previously included in gross operating margin.
The results of operations from our liquids pipelines are primarily dependent upon the volumes transported and the associated fees
we charge for such transportation services.  Typically, pipeline transportation revenue is recognized when volumes are re-delivered
to customers.  However, under certain pipeline transportation agreements, customers are required to ship a minimum volume over
an agreed-upon period.  These arrangements may entail the shipper paying a transportation fee based on a minimum volume
commitment, with a provision that allows the shipper to make-up any volume shortfalls over the agreed-upon period (referred to as
shipper “make-up rights”).  Revenue pursuant to such agreements is initially deferred and subsequently recognized under GAAP at
the earlier of when the deficiency volume is shipped, when the likelihood of the shipper’s ability to meet the minimum volume
commitment becomes remote, or when the pipeline is otherwise released from its performance obligation.
However, management includes deferred transportation revenues relating to the “make-up rights” of committed shippers when
reviewing the financial results of certain pipelines (Texas Express Pipeline, Front Range Pipeline, ATEX, Aegis Ethane Pipeline,
and Seaway Pipeline).  From an internal (and segment) reporting standpoint, management considers the transportation fees paid by
committed shippers on these pipelines, including any non-refundable revenues that may be deferred under GAAP related to make-
up rights, to be important in assessing the financial performance of these pipeline assets.  Although the adjustments for make-up
rights are included in segment gross operating margin, our consolidated revenues do not reflect any deferred revenues until the
conditions for recognizing such revenues are met in accordance with GAAP.
Gross operating margin by segment is calculated by subtracting segment operating costs and expenses from segment revenues, with
both segment totals reflecting the adjustments noted in the preceding table, as applicable, and before the elimination of
intercompany transactions.  The following table presents gross operating margin by segment for the years indicated:
  For the Year Ended December 31,

Segment revenues include intersegment and intrasegment transactions, which are generally based on transactions made at market-
based rates.  Our consolidated revenues reflect the elimination of intercompany transactions.
We include equity in income of unconsolidated affiliates in our measurement of segment gross operating margin and operating
income.  Equity investments with industry partners are a significant component of our business strategy.  They are a means by
which we conduct our operations to align our interests with those of customers and/or suppliers.  This method of operation enables
us to achieve favorable economies of scale relative to the level of investment and business risk assumed.  Many of these businesses
perform supporting or complementary roles to our other midstream business operations.
Our integrated midstream energy asset network (including the midstream energy assets owned by our unconsolidated affiliates)
provides services to producers and consumers of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil, refined products and certain petrochemicals.  In
general, hydrocarbons may enter our asset system in a number of ways, such as through a natural gas gathering pipeline, natural gas
processing facility, a crude oil pipeline or terminal, an NGL fractionator, an NGL storage facility or an NGL gathering or
transportation pipeline.  The assets of many of our equity investees are included within our integrated midstream network.  For
example, we use the Front Range Pipeline and Texas Express Pipeline to transport mixed NGLs to our Chambers County NGL
fractionation and storage complex and the Seaway Pipeline to transport crude oil to our terminals in the Houston, Texas
area.  Given the integral nature of these equity method investees to our operations, we believe the presentation of equity earnings
from such investees as a component of gross operating margin and operating income is meaningful and appropriate.

Segment assets consist of property, plant and equipment, investments in unconsolidated affiliates, intangible assets and
goodwill.  The carrying values of such amounts are assigned to each segment based on each asset’s or investment’s principal
operations and contribution to the gross operating margin of that particular segment.  Since construction-in-progress (a component
of property, plant and equipment) does not contribute to segment gross operating margin, such amounts are excluded from segment
asset totals until the underlying assets are placed in service.  Intangible assets and goodwill are assigned to each segment based on
the classification of the assets to which they relate.  The remainder of our consolidated total assets, which consist primarily of
working capital assets, are excluded from segment assets since these amounts are not attributable to one specific segment (e.g.,
cash).

(1)Represents the cost of operating our plants, pipelines and other fixed assets excluding: depreciation, amortization and accretion charges; asset impairment
charges; and net losses (gains) attributable to asset sales and related matters.
Fluctuations in our product sales revenues and cost of sales amounts are explained in large part by changes in energy commodity
prices.  In general, higher energy commodity prices result in an increase in our revenues attributable to product sales; however,
these higher commodity prices would also be expected to increase the associated cost of sales as purchase costs are higher.  The
same type of relationship would be true in the case of lower energy commodity sales prices and purchase costs.
Major Customer Information
Substantially all of our consolidated revenues are earned in the U.S. and derived from a wide customer base.  For the year ended
December 31, 2022, Vitol Holding B.V. and its affiliates (collectively, “Vitol”) accounted for $5.92 billion, or 10.2%, of our
consolidated revenues.  Vitol is a global energy and commodity trading company. Revenues earned from Vitol during 2022 are
included within each of our four business segments.
No single customer accounted for 10% or more of our consolidated revenues during the years ended December 31, 2021 or 2020.

(2)We use the “if-converted method” to determine the potential dilutive effect of the vesting of phantom unit awards and the conversion of preferred units
outstanding.  See Note 8 for information regarding preferred units.
Note 12. Business Combinations
On February 17, 2022, an affiliate of Enterprise acquired all of the member interests in Navitas Midstream Partners, LLC (“Navitas
Midstream”) for $3.2 billion in cash.  We funded the cash consideration using proceeds from the issuance of short-term notes under
EPO’s commercial paper program and cash on hand.
Navitas Midstream's assets (the “Midland Basin System”) include approximately 1,750 miles of pipelines and over 1.0 Bcf/d of
cryogenic natural gas processing capacity. The acquired business expands our natural gas processing and NGL businesses to the
Midland Basin in West Texas.
The acquisition of Navitas Midstream was accounted for under the acquisition method in accordance with ASC 805, Business
Combinations.  The preliminary allocation of purchase consideration was based upon the estimated fair value of the tangible and
identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the acquisition.  The preliminary allocation was made to major
categories of assets and liabilities based on management’s best estimates and supported by an independent third-party analysis.
F-49
Table of Contents
The following table presents the final fair value allocation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the acquisition at February
17, 2022 (the effective date of the acquisition).
Purchase price for 100% interest in Navitas Midstream  $ 3,231 
Recognized amounts of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed:     
  Cash and cash equivalents  $ 27 
  Property, plant and equipment   2,080 
  Contract-based intangible asset   989 
  Assumed liabilities, net of acquired other assets (1)   (24)
Total identifiable net assets  $ 3,072 
Goodwill  $ 159 
(1)Assumed liabilities primarily include accounts payable, other current liabilities, lease liabilities and asset retirement obligations.  Acquired other assets
primarily include accounts receivable, other current assets and ROU assets.  None of these amounts were considered individually significant.
The estimated fair value of the acquired property, plant and equipment was determined using the cost approach.  The fair value of
property, plant and equipment primarily consisted of personal property of $1.6 billion, real property of $250 million and
construction in progress of $175 million.  See Note 4 for additional information regarding our property, plant and equipment.
The contract-based intangible asset represents the estimated value we assigned to the acquired long-term contracts with customers
that dedicate future lease production to our system.  The estimated fair value of the acquired contract-based intangible assets was
determined using an income approach, specifically a discounted cash flow analysis.  The fair value estimate incorporates Level 3
inputs including: (i) management’s long-term forecast of cash flows generated by the Midland Basin System based on the estimated
economic life of the hydrocarbon resource basin served and resource depletion rates; and (ii) a discount rate of 15.5%, which is
based on a benchmarking analysis with reference to the implied rate of return on the Navitas Midstream acquisition and a market
participant weighted average cost of capital.  We will amortize the value assigned to this intangible asset using a units-of-
production method.  The estimated useful life of the acquired contract-based intangible asset is 30 years.
We recorded $159 million of goodwill in connection with this transaction.  In general, we attribute this goodwill to our ability to
leverage the acquired business with our existing NGL asset base to create future business opportunities.
The financial results for the processing activities of the acquired business are reported under the NGL Pipelines & Services
business segment and the gathering activities are reported under the Natural Gas Pipelines & Services business segment.
The contribution of this newly acquired business to our consolidated revenues and net income was not material during the year
ended December 31, 2022.  Additionally, acquisition related costs were not material during the year ended December 31, 2022.
On a historical pro forma basis, our revenues, costs and expenses, operating income, net income attributable to common unitholders
and earnings per unit for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 would not have differed materially from those we actually
reported had the acquisition been completed on January 1, 2021 rather than February 17, 2022.

Note 13.  Equity-Based Awards
An allocated portion of the fair value of EPCO’s equity-based awards is charged to us under the ASA.  The following table
summarizes compensation expense we recognized in connection with equity-based awards for the years indicated:
  For the Year Ended December 31,  
  2022   2021   2020  
Equity-classified awards:          
Phantom unit awards  $ 153  $ 146  $ 150 
Profits interest awards   4   6   9 
Total  $ 157  $ 152  $ 159 
The fair value of equity-classified awards is amortized to earnings over the requisite service or vesting period.  Equity-classified
awards are expected to result in the issuance of the Partnership’s common units upon vesting.
In November 2022, our unitholders approved the 2008 Enterprise Products Long-Term Incentive Plan (Fourth Amendment and
Restatement) (referred to as the “2008 Plan”).  The 2008 Plan, which was also approved by (i) the Incentive Plan Administration
Subcommittee (the “IPA Subcommittee”) of the Governance Committee of the Board of Enterprise GP and (ii) the Board of
Enterprise GP, is a plan under which any non-employee director, employee or consultants of EPCO, the Partnership or its affiliates
providing services, directly or indirectly, for the Partnership or its subsidiaries may receive incentive compensation awards in the
form of options, restricted units, phantom units, distribution equivalent rights, unit appreciation rights, unit awards, other unit-based
awards or substitute awards.
The maximum number of the Partnership’s common units authorized for issuance under the 2008 Plan was 165,000,000 at
December 31, 2022.  The 2008 Plan is effective until November 22, 2032 or, if earlier, until (i) the time that all available common
units under the 2008 Plan have been delivered to participants or (ii) the time of termination of the 2008 Plan by the Board of
Directors of EPCO or by the IPA Subcommittee.  After giving effect to awards granted under the 2008 Plan through December 31,
2022, a total of 115,360,224 additional common units were available for issuance.  After taking into account tax withholding
requirements, we issued 4,571,333, 3,936,437 and 3,162,095 common units in connection with the vesting of phantom unit awards
in the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Phantom Unit Awards
Subject to customary forfeiture provisions, phantom unit awards allow recipients to acquire the Partnership’s common units once a
defined vesting period expires (at no cost to the recipient apart from fulfilling required service and other conditions).  We expect
phantom units to result in the issuance of common units upon vesting; therefore, these grants are accounted for as equity-classified
awards. Phantom unit awards generally vest at a rate of 25% per year beginning one year after the grant date and are non-vested
until the required service periods expire.
The grant date fair value of a phantom unit award is based on the market price per unit of the Partnership’s common units on the
date of grant. Compensation expense is recognized based on the grant date fair value, net of an allowance for estimated forfeitures,
over the requisite service or vesting period.

(1)Determined by dividing the aggregate grant date fair value of awards (before an allowance for forfeitures) by the number of awards issued.
(2)The aggregate grant date fair value of phantom unit awards issued during 2020 was $190 million based on a grant date market price of the Partnership’s
common units ranging from $16.95 to $25.76 per unit.  An estimated annual forfeiture rate of 2.4% was applied to these awards.
(3)The aggregate grant date fair value of phantom unit awards issued during 2021 was $164 million based on a grant date market price of the Partnership’s
common units ranging from $20.79 to $22.05 per unit.  An estimated annual forfeiture rate of 2.0% was applied to these awards.
(4)The aggregate grant date fair value of phantom unit awards issued during 2022 was $192 million based on a grant date market price of the Partnership’s
common units ranging from $24.10 to $26.62 per unit.  An estimated annual forfeiture rate of 2.1% was applied to these awards.
The 2008 Plan provides for the issuance of DERs in connection with phantom unit awards.  A DER entitles the participant to
nonforfeitable cash payments equal to the product of the number of phantom unit awards outstanding for the participant and the
cash distribution per common unit paid by the Partnership to its common unitholders.  Cash payments made in connection with
DERs are charged to partners’ equity when the phantom unit award is expected to result in the issuance of common units;
otherwise, such amounts are expensed.
The following table presents supplemental information regarding phantom unit awards for the years indicated:
 
  For the Year Ended December 31,  
  2022   2021   2020  
Cash payments made in connection with DERs  $ 34  $ 31  $ 27 
Total intrinsic value of phantom unit awards that vested during period  $ 160  $ 124  $ 115 
For the EPCO group of companies, the unrecognized compensation cost associated with phantom unit awards was $153 million at
December 31, 2022, of which our share of such cost is currently estimated to be $123 million.  Due to the graded vesting provisions
of these awards, we expect to recognize our share of the unrecognized compensation cost for these awards over a weighted-average
period of 2.1 years.
Profits Interest Awards
In 2016 and 2018, EPCO Holdings Inc. (“EPCO Holdings”), a privately held affiliate of EPCO, contributed a portion of the
Partnership’s common units it owned to form limited partnerships (referred to as “Employee Partnerships”) that serve as long-term
incentive arrangements for key employees of EPCO by providing them a “profits interest” (in the form of a Class B limited partner
interest) in an Employee Partnership.  The Employee Partnerships named (i) EPD PubCo Unit I L.P. (“PubCo I”), (ii) EPD PubCo
Unit II L.P. (“PubCo II”), and (iii) EPD PrivCo Unit I L.P. (“PrivCo I”) were formed by EPCO Holdings in 2016.  The Employee
Partnerships named (i) EPD 2018 Unit IV L.P. (“EPD IV”) and (ii) EPCO Unit II L.P. (“EPCO II”) were formed by EPCO
Holdings in 2018.  The Class B limited partner interests of PubCo I vested in February 2020.  The Class B limited partner interests
of PubCo II and PrivCo I vested in June 2021.
F-52
Table of Contents
In exchange for the contributions of the Partnership’s common units, EPCO Holdings was admitted as the Class A limited partner
of each Employee Partnership. Also on the applicable contribution date, certain key EPCO employees were issued Class B limited
partner interests (i.e., profits interest awards) and admitted as Class B limited partners of each Employee Partnership, all without
any capital contribution by such employees.  EPCO serves as the general partner of each Employee Partnership.
Each quarter, the Employee Partnerships, as owners of the Partnership’s common units, receive a cash distribution from the
Partnership as do the Partnership’s other common unitholders.  The cash received by the Employee Partnership is first used to pay
the Class A limited partner a cash distribution equal to the product of (i) the number of the Partnership’s common units owned by
the Employee Partnership and (ii) the Class A Preference Return (subject to equitable adjustment in order to reflect any equity split,
equity distribution or dividend, reverse split, combination, reclassification, recapitalization or other similar event affecting such
common units). To the extent that the Employee Partnership has cash remaining after making this quarterly payment to the Class A
limited partner, the residual cash is distributed to the Class B limited partners on a quarterly basis as a distribution.
Upon liquidation of an Employee Partnership, assets having a then current fair market value equal to the Class A limited partner’s
capital base in such Employee Partnership will be distributed to the Class A limited partner. Any remaining assets of such
Employee Partnership will be distributed to the Class B limited partners of such Employee Partnership as a residual profits interest,
which represents the appreciation in value of the Employee Partnership’s assets since the date of EPCO Holdings’ contribution to it,
as described above.
Unless otherwise agreed to by EPCO and a majority in interest of the limited partners of each Employee Partnership, such
Employee Partnership will terminate at the earliest to occur of (i) 30 days following its vesting date, (ii) a change of control or (iii)
a dissolution of the Employee Partnership.
Individually, each Class B limited partner interest is subject to forfeiture if the participating employee’s employment with EPCO is
terminated prior to vesting, with customary exceptions for death, disability and certain retirements. The risk of forfeiture will also
lapse upon certain change of control events. Forfeited individual Class B limited partner interests are allocated to the remaining
Class B limited partners.

(1)Represents the fair market value of the Partnership’s common units contributed to each Employee Partnership at the applicable contribution date.
(2)Represents the total fair value of the profits interest awards awarded to the Class B limited partners of each Employee Partnership irrespective of how such
costs will be allocated between us and EPCO and its privately held affiliates.  The fair value is as of the grant date or as of the plan modification date, as
applicable.
(3)Represents our expected share of the unrecognized compensation cost at December 31, 2022, which we expect to recognize over a weighted-average period of
0.9 years.
The fair value of each Employee Partnership (at either the grant date or modification date) is based on (i) the estimated value (as
determined using a Black-Scholes option pricing model) of such Employee Partnership’s assets that would be distributed to the
Class B limited partners thereof upon liquidation and (ii) the value, based on a discounted cash flow analysis, of the residual
quarterly cash amounts that such Class B limited partners are expected to receive over the life of the Employee Partnership.

Table of Contents
The following table summarizes the assumptions we used in applying a Black-Scholes option pricing model, to derive that portion
of the estimated fair value of the profits interest awards (at either the grant date or modification date) for each Employee
Partnership:
Expected Life Risk-Free Expected Expected Unit
Employee of Award Interest Distribution Price
Partnership from Grant Date Rate Yield Volatility
EPD IV 5.0 years 0.2% to 2.8% 6.5% to 8.4% 27% to 39%
EPCO II 5.0 years 0.2% to 2.8% 6.3% to 8.4% 24% to 36%
Compensation expense attributable to the profits interest awards is based on the estimated fair value of each award. A portion of the
fair value of these equity-based awards is allocated to us under the ASA as a non-cash expense. We are not responsible for
reimbursing EPCO for any expenses of the Employee Partnerships, including the value of any contributions of units made by
EPCO Holdings.
Note 14.  Hedging Activities and Fair Value Measurements
In the normal course of our business operations, we are exposed to certain risks, including changes in interest rates and commodity
prices.  In order to manage risks associated with assets, liabilities and certain anticipated future transactions, we use derivative
instruments such as futures, forward contracts, swaps, options and other instruments with similar characteristics.  Substantially all
of our derivatives are used for non-trading activities.
Interest Rate Hedging Activities
We may utilize interest rate swaps, forward-starting swaps, options to enter into forward-starting swaps (“swaptions”), treasury
locks and similar derivative instruments to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates charged on borrowings under certain
consolidated debt agreements.  This strategy may be used in controlling our overall cost of capital associated with such borrowings.
Treasury Locks
A treasury lock is an agreement that fixes the price (or yield) of a specified U.S. treasury security for an established period of time. 
We use treasury lock agreements to hedge our exposure to interest rate changes and to reduce the volatility of financing costs on an
expected future debt issuance.  During the fourth quarter of 2022, we entered into a treasury lock transaction to fix the ten-year
treasury rate at 3.45% on a notional amount of $750 million.  In January 2023, we entered into an additional treasury lock
transaction to fix the three-year treasury rate at 4.165% on a notional amount of $750 million.  The purpose of these transactions
was to hedge the underlying interest rate risk associated with debt issuances expected to occur in January 2023 (see Note 20).  Both
of our treasury lock transactions were designated as cash flow hedges of the interest payments associated with the expected debt
issuances.  In January 2023, we terminated both treasury lock transactions simultaneously with our issuance of the three-year and
ten-year notes and received total cash proceeds of $21 million.  As cash flow hedges, gains on these derivative instruments are
reflected as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and will be amortized to earnings as a reduction to interest
expense over the full term of each issuance.
Forward-Starting Swaps
Forward-starting swaps hedge the risk of an increase in underlying benchmark interest rates during the period of time between the
inception date of the swap agreement and the future date of a debt issuance. Under the terms of the forward-starting swaps, we pay
to the counterparties (at the expected settlement dates of the instruments) amounts based on a fixed interest rate applied to a
notional amount and receive from the counterparties an amount equal to a variable interest rate (based on LIBOR or an equivalent
index rate) on the same notional amount.
F-54
Table of Contents
During 2021, we terminated an aggregate $1.1 billion notional amount of forward-starting swaps, which resulted in net cash
proceeds of $75 million.  Since the original swaptions associated with certain of these forward-starting swaps were not designated
as hedging instruments and were subject to mark-to-market accounting, we previously incurred an unrealized, mark-to-market loss
at inception of the forward starting swaps of $48 million that was reflected as an increase in interest expense in 2019.  Immediately
following exercise of the swaptions and being put into the forward-starting swaps, these instruments were designated as cash flow
hedges.  For the period from inception through the termination date in March 2021, we recognized cumulative gains on the
forward-starting swaps of $123 million in accumulated other comprehensive income, of which $99 million is being reclassified to
earnings (as a decrease in interest expense) over the 30-year life of the associated debt through February 2053 and $22 million will
be reclassified to earnings (as a decrease in interest expense) over the cumulative life of the associated Senior Notes GGG (see
Note 20) and future debt obligations.  We reclassified $2 million of the cumulative gain as a decrease in interest expense in 2021.
During 2020, we terminated an aggregate $575 million notional amount of forward-starting swaps, which resulted in net cash
payments of $33 million.  As cash flow hedges, losses on these derivative instruments are reflected as a component of accumulated
other comprehensive loss and are being amortized to earnings (as an increase in interest expense) over the 30-year life of the
associated debt through January 2051.
Commodity Hedging Activities
The prices of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil, petrochemicals and refined products are subject to fluctuations in response to changes in
supply and demand, market conditions and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control.  In order to manage such
price risks, we enter into commodity derivative instruments such as physical forward contracts, futures contracts, fixed-for-float
swaps and basis swaps.
At December 31, 2022, our predominant commodity hedging strategies consisted of (i) hedging anticipated future purchases and
sales of commodity products associated with transportation, storage and blending activities, (ii) hedging natural gas processing
margins and (iii) hedging the fair value of commodity products held in inventory.  
•The objective of our anticipated future commodity purchases and sales hedging program is to hedge the margins of certain
transportation, storage, blending and operational activities by locking in purchase and sale prices through the use of derivative
instruments and related contracts.
•The objective of our natural gas processing hedging program is to hedge an amount of earnings associated with these activities.
We achieve this objective by executing fixed-price sales for a portion of our expected equity NGL production using derivative
instruments and related contracts. For certain natural gas processing contracts, the hedging of expected equity NGL production
also involves the purchase of natural gas for shrinkage, which is hedged using derivative instruments and related contracts.
•The objective of our inventory hedging program is to hedge the fair value of commodity products currently held in inventory
by locking in the sales price of the inventory through the use of derivative instruments and related contracts.

(2)The maximum term for derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, derivatives designated as fair value hedges and derivatives not designated as hedging
instruments is December 2025, February 2023 and December 2024, respectively.
(3)Reflects the use of derivative instruments to manage risks associated with our transportation, processing and storage assets.   
The carrying amount of our inventories subject to fair value hedges was $12 million and $102 million at December 31, 2022 and
2021, respectively.
Certain basis swaps, basis spread options and other derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments are used to
manage market risks associated with anticipated purchases and sales of commodity products.  There is some uncertainty involved
in the timing of these transactions often due to the development of more favorable profit opportunities or when spreads are
insufficient to cover variable costs thus reducing the likelihood that the transactions will occur during the periods originally
forecasted.  In accordance with derivatives accounting guidance, these instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting even though
they are effective at managing the risk exposures of the underlying assets.  Due to volatility in commodity prices, any non-cash,
mark-to-market earnings variability cannot be predicted.

Derivative assets and liabilities recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets are presented on a gross basis and determined at the
individual transaction level.  This presentation method is applied regardless of whether the respective exchange clearing
agreements, counterparty contracts or master netting agreements contain netting language often referred to as “rights of
offset.”  Although derivative amounts are presented on a gross basis, having rights of offset enable the settlement of a net as
opposed to gross receivable or payable amount under a counterparty default or liquidation scenario.
Cash is paid and received as collateral under certain agreements, particularly for those associated with exchange transactions.  For
any cash collateral payments or receipts, corresponding assets or liabilities are recorded to reflect the variation margin deposits or
receipts with exchange clearing brokers and customers.  These balances are also presented on a gross basis on our Consolidated
Balance Sheets.
The tabular presentation above provides a means for comparing the gross amount of derivative assets and liabilities, excluding
associated accounts payable and receivable, to the net amount that would likely be receivable or payable under a default scenario
based on the existence of rights of offset in the respective derivative agreements.  Any cash collateral paid or received is reflected in
these tables, but only to the extent that it represents variation margins.  Any amounts associated with derivative prepayments or
initial margins that are not influenced by the derivative asset or liability amounts or those that are determined solely on their
volumetric notional amounts are excluded from these tables.

Fair Value Measurements
The following tables set forth, by level within the Level 1, 2 and 3 fair value hierarchy (see Note 2), the carrying values of our
financial assets and liabilities at the dates indicated. These assets and liabilities are measured on a recurring basis and are classified
based on the lowest level of input used to estimate their fair value. Our assessment of the relative significance of such inputs
requires judgment.
The values for commodity derivatives are presented before and after the application of Chicago Mercantile Exchange (“CME”)
Rule 814, which deems that financial instruments cleared by the CME are settled daily in connection with variation margin
payments.  As a result of this exchange rule, CME-related derivatives are considered to have no fair value at the balance sheet date
for financial reporting purposes; however, the derivatives remain outstanding and subject to future commodity price fluctuations
until they are settled in accordance with their contractual terms.  Derivative transactions cleared on exchanges other than the CME
(e.g., the Intercontinental Exchange or ICE) continue to be reported on a gross basis.

Other Fair Value Information
The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents (including restricted cash balances), accounts receivable, commercial paper
notes and accounts payable approximate their fair values based on their short-term nature.  The estimated total fair value of our
fixed-rate debt obligations was $24.2 billion and $33.5 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.  The aggregate
carrying value of these debt obligations was $27.5 billion and $29.6 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.  These
values are primarily based on quoted market prices for such debt or debt of similar terms and maturities (Level 2) and our credit
standing.  Changes in market rates of interest affect the fair value of our fixed-rate debt.  The carrying values of our variable-rate
long-term debt obligations approximate their fair values since the associated interest rates are market-based.  We do not have any
long-term investments in debt or equity securities recorded at fair value.

Relationship with EPCO and Affiliates
We have an extensive and ongoing relationship with EPCO and its privately held affiliates (including Enterprise GP, our general

Table of Contents
Of the total number of Partnership common units held by EPCO and its privately held affiliates, 92,976,464 have been pledged as
security under the separate credit facilities of EPCO and its privately held affiliates at December 31, 2022.  These credit facilities
contain customary and other events of default, including defaults by us and other affiliates of EPCO.  An event of default, followed
by a foreclosure on the pledged collateral, could ultimately result in a change in ownership of these units and affect the market
price of the Partnership’s common units.
The Partnership and Enterprise GP are both separate legal entities apart from each other and apart from EPCO and its other
affiliates, with assets and liabilities that are also separate from those of EPCO and its other affiliates.  EPCO and its privately held
affiliates use cash on hand and cash distributions they receive from us and other investments to fund their other activities and to
meet their respective debt obligations, if any.  During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we paid EPCO and its
privately held affiliates cash distributions totaling $1.3 billion, $1.2 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively.
We lease office space from privately held affiliates of EPCO at rental rates that approximate market rates.  For each of the years
ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we recognized $13 million of related party operating lease expense in connection with
these office space leases.
EPCO ASA
We have no employees.  All of our administrative and operating functions are provided either by employees of EPCO (pursuant to
the ASA) or by other service providers.  We and our general partner are parties to the ASA.  
Under the ASA, EPCO provides us with the administrative and operating services deemed necessary to manage and operate our
businesses, properties and assets (all in accordance with prudent industry practices). Our operating costs and expenses include
amounts paid to EPCO for the actual direct and indirect costs it incurs to operate our facilities, including the compensation of its
employees. Likewise, our general and administrative costs include amounts paid to EPCO for management and other administrative
services, including the compensation of its employees.  In general, our reimbursement to EPCO for administrative services is either
(i) on an actual basis for direct expenses it may incur on our behalf (e.g., the purchase of office supplies) or (ii) based on an
allocation of such charges between the various parties to the ASA based on the estimated use of such services by each party (e.g.,
the allocation of legal or accounting salaries based on estimates of time spent on each entity’s business and affairs).  In addition, we
have agreed to pay all sales, use, excise, value added or similar taxes, if any, that may be applicable from time to time with respect
to the services provided to us by EPCO.
The ASA allows us to participate as a named insured in EPCO’s overall insurance program, with the associated premiums and other
costs being allocated to us.  See Note 18 for additional information regarding our insurance programs.
The following table presents our related party costs and expenses attributable to the ASA with EPCO for the years indicated:
  For the Year Ended December 31,  
  2022   2021   2020  
Operating costs and expenses  $ 1,124  $ 1,011  $ 999 
General and administrative expenses   146   135   129 
     Total costs and expenses  $ 1,270  $ 1,146  $ 1,128 
Since the vast majority of such expenses are charged to us on an actual basis (i.e., no mark-up is charged or subsidy is received), we
believe that such expenses are representative of what the amounts would have been on a standalone basis.  With respect to allocated
costs, we believe that the proportional direct allocation method employed by EPCO is reasonable and reflective of the estimated
level of costs we would have incurred on a standalone basis.

Relationships with Unconsolidated Affiliates
Many of our unconsolidated affiliates perform supporting or complementary roles to our other business operations.  The following
information summarizes significant related party transactions with our unconsolidated affiliates:
•For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we paid Seaway $20 million, $104 million and $72 million,
respectively, for pipeline transportation and storage services in connection with our crude oil marketing activities.  Revenues
from Seaway were $15 million, $43 million and $20 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020,
respectively.
•For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we purchased $107 million, $94 million and $51 million, respectively,
of NGLs from VESCO.
•We pay Promix for the transportation, storage and fractionation of NGLs.  Expenses with Promix were $41 million, $27
million and $24 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.  In addition, we sell natural gas
to Promix for its plant fuel requirements.  Revenues from Promix were $22 million, $12 million and $6 million for the years
ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.  
•For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we paid Texas Express $31 million, $28 million and $29 million,
respectively, for pipeline transportation services.  
•For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we paid Eagle Ford Crude Oil Pipeline $3 million, $4 million and $21
million, respectively, for pipeline transportation services.
•We perform management services for certain of our unconsolidated affiliates.  We charged such affiliates $12 million, $13
million and $10 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 
Note 16.  Income Taxes
Publicly traded partnerships like ours are treated as corporations unless they have 90% or more in “qualifying income” (as that term
is defined in the Internal Revenue Code).  We satisfied this requirement in each of the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and
2020 and, as a result, are not subject to federal income tax.  However, our partners are individually responsible for paying federal
income tax on their share of our taxable income.  Net earnings for financial reporting purposes may differ significantly from
taxable income reportable to our unitholders as a result of differences between the tax basis and financial reporting basis of certain
assets and liabilities and other factors.  We do not have access to information regarding each partner’s individual tax basis in our
limited partner interests.  
The following table presents the components of our consolidated benefit from (provision for) income taxes for the years indicated:
  For the Year Ended December 31,  
  2022   2021   2020  
Deferred tax benefit (provision) attributable to OTA  $ (22) $ (28) $ 155 
Texas Margin Tax   (56)  (42)  (32)
Other   (4)  –   1 
Benefit from (provision for) income taxes  $ (82) $ (70) $ 124 
In addition to income tax amounts attributable to OTA (as described below), the provision for income taxes includes our state tax
obligations under the Revised Texas Franchise Tax (the “Texas Margin Tax”).
F-64
Table of Contents
Income taxes are accounted for under the asset-and-liability method.  Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for
the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and
liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are
expected to be recovered or settled.  The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income
in the period that includes the enactment date.
We recognize the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained. Recognized
income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized. Changes in recognition or
measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs.  Accounting guidance provides that a tax benefit
from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon
examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits.  We did not rely on
any uncertain tax positions in recording our income tax-related amounts during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and
2020.
OTA Deferred Tax Liability
On March 5, 2020, the Partnership settled its obligations under the Liquidity Option Agreement (see Note 8) and indirectly
assumed OTA’s deferred tax liability, which reflects OTA’s outside basis difference in the limited partner interests it received from
the Partnership in October 2014.  Upon settlement of the Liquidity Option, the Liquidity Option liability was effectively replaced
by the deferred tax liability of OTA calculated in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes.
At March 5, 2020, the Liquidity Option liability amount was $512 million.  Since the book value of the Liquidity Option liability
exceeded OTA’s estimated deferred tax liability of $440 million on that date, we recognized a non-cash benefit in earnings of $72
million, which is reflected in the “Benefit from (provision for) income tax” line on our Statement of Consolidated Operations for
the year ended December 31, 2020.  OTA recognized an additional net, non-cash deferred income tax benefit of $83 million
primarily due to a decrease in the outside basis difference of its investment in the Partnership attributable to a decline in the market
price of the Partnership’s common units subsequent to March 5, 2020 through September 30, 2020.  In total, earnings for the year
ended December 31, 2020 reflect $155 million of net deferred income tax benefit attributable to OTA.
On September 30, 2020, OTA exchanged the Partnership common units it owned for non-publicly traded preferred units having a
stated value of $1,000 per unit (see Note 8).  As a result and beginning September 30, 2020, OTA’s deferred tax liability no longer
fluctuates due to market price changes in the Partnership’s common units. Our subsidiary OTA is a corporation for U.S. federal
income tax purposes, and the exchange of common units for preferred units did not constitute a taxable transaction for OTA.

(1)Although the Texas Margin Tax is not considered a state income tax, it has the characteristics of an income tax since it is determined by applying a tax rate to a
base that considers our Texas-sourced revenues and expenses.
(2)The total benefit recognized in income tax expense on March 5, 2020 from settlement of the Liquidity Option was $72 million, which is comprised of $4
million of state income tax benefit and $68 million of federal income tax benefit.
(3)Management believes that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets attributable to OTA will not be fully realizable.  Accordingly, we provided
for a valuation allowance against OTA’s net deferred tax assets.
Deferred income taxes are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial statement and income tax bases of
assets and liabilities as measured by the enacted tax rates, which will be in effect when these differences reverse.
The following table presents the significant components of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities at the dates indicated:

Note 17.  Commitments and Contingent Liabilities
Litigation
As part of our normal business activities, we may be named as defendants in legal proceedings, including those arising from
regulatory and environmental matters.  Although we are insured against various risks to the extent we believe it is prudent, there is
no assurance that the nature and amount of such insurance will be adequate, in every case, to fully indemnify us against losses
arising from future legal proceedings.  We will vigorously defend the Partnership in litigation matters.
Management has regular quarterly litigation reviews, including updates from legal counsel, to assess the possible need for
accounting recognition and disclosure of these contingencies.  We accrue an undiscounted liability for those contingencies where
the loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated.  If a range of probable loss amounts can be reasonably estimated
and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, then the minimum amount in the range is accrued.
We do not record a contingent liability when the likelihood of loss is probable but the amount cannot be reasonably estimated or
when the likelihood of loss is believed to be only reasonably possible or remote.  For contingencies where an unfavorable outcome
is reasonably possible and the impact would be material to our consolidated financial statements, we disclose the nature of the
contingency and, where feasible, an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss.  Based on a consideration of all relevant known
facts and circumstances, we do not believe that the ultimate outcome of any currently pending litigation directed against us will
have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements either individually at the claim level or in the aggregate.
There were no accruals for litigation contingencies at December 31, 2022.  Our accruals for litigation contingencies were
immaterial at December 31, 2021.  We have classified our accruals for litigation contingencies in our Consolidated Balance Sheets
as a component of “Other current liabilities” or “Other long-term liabilities” based on management’s estimate regarding the timing
of settlement.  Our evaluation of litigation contingencies is based on the facts and circumstances of each case and predicting the
outcome of these matters involves uncertainties.  In the event the assumptions we use to evaluate these matters change in future
periods or new information becomes available, we may be required to record additional accruals.  In an effort to mitigate expenses
associated with litigation, we may settle legal proceedings out of court.
PDH Litigation
In July 2013, we executed a contract with Foster Wheeler USA Corporation (“Foster Wheeler”) pursuant to which Foster Wheeler
was to serve as the general contractor responsible for the engineering, procurement, construction and installation of our first
propane dehydrogenation facility (“PDH 1”).  In November 2014, Foster Wheeler was acquired by an affiliate of AMEC plc to
form Amec Foster Wheeler plc, and Foster Wheeler is now known as Amec Foster Wheeler USA Corporation (“AFW”).  In
December 2015, Enterprise and AFW entered into a transition services agreement under which AFW was partially terminated from
the PDH 1 project.  In December 2015, Enterprise engaged a second contractor, Optimized Process Designs LLC, to complete the
construction and installation of PDH 1.
On September 2, 2016, we terminated AFW for cause and filed a lawsuit in the 151st Judicial Civil District Court of Harris County,
Texas against AFW and its parent company, Amec Foster Wheeler plc, asserting claims for breach of contract, breach of warranty,
fraudulent inducement, string-along fraud, gross negligence, professional negligence, negligent misrepresentation and attorneys’
fees.  Trial for the case began on April 19, 2022, and closing arguments were completed July 22, 2022.  Effective November 11,
2022, the parties reached a settlement of the claims underlying the lawsuit.  As part of the settlement, AFW paid $115 million in
cash to Enterprise.
F-67
Table of Contents
The settlement amount was attributable to the partial recovery of capital costs incurred during the time that Foster Wheeler served
as general contractor and the partial recovery of attorneys’ fees incurred as a result of the litigation.  Based on management’s
evaluation of the settlement amount relative to the damages and costs incurred, we determined that $99 million of the settlement
was attributable to the partial recovery of capital costs, which is reflected as a reduction to “Property, plant and equipment, net” on
our Consolidated Balance Sheets and presented as a component of “Proceeds from asset sales and other matters” on our Statements
of Consolidated Cash Flows, and $16 million was attributable to the partial recovery of attorneys’ fees, which are a component of
“Other, net” within the “Other income (expense)” section of our Statements of Consolidated Operations and a component of cash
provided by operating activities as presented on our Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows.
Commitments Under Equity Compensation Plans of EPCO
In accordance with our agreements with EPCO, we reimburse EPCO for our share of its compensation expense attributable to
employees who perform management, administrative and operating functions for us.  See Notes 13 and 15 for additional
information regarding our accounting for equity-based awards and related party information, respectively.
Contractual Obligations
The following table summarizes our various contractual obligations at December 31, 2022.  A description of each type of
contractual obligation follows:

Scheduled Maturities of Debt
We have long-term and short-term payment obligations under debt agreements.  Amounts shown in the preceding table represent
our scheduled future maturities of debt principal for the years indicated.  See Note 7 for additional information regarding our
consolidated debt obligations.
Estimated Cash Interest Payments
Our estimated cash payments for interest are based on the principal amount of our consolidated debt obligations outstanding at
December 31, 2022, the contractually scheduled maturities of such balances, and the applicable interest rates.  Our estimated cash
payments for interest are influenced by the long-term maturities of our $2.3 billion in junior subordinated notes (due June 2067
through February 2078).  The estimated cash payments assume that (i) the junior subordinated notes are not repaid prior to their
respective maturity dates and (ii) the amount of interest paid on the junior subordinated notes is based on either (a) the current fixed
interest rate charged or (b) the weighted-average variable rate paid in 2022, as applicable, for each note through the respective
maturity date.  See Note 7 for information regarding fixed and weighted-average variable interest rates charged in 2022.
Operating Lease Obligations
We lease certain property, plant and equipment under noncancelable and cancelable operating leases.  Amounts shown in the
preceding table represent minimum cash lease payment obligations under our operating leases with terms in excess of one year.
F-68
Table of Contents
Our significant lease agreements consist of (i) land held pursuant to property leases, (ii) the lease of underground storage caverns
for natural gas, NGLs and ethylene, (iii) the lease of transportation equipment used in our operations and (iv) office space leased
from affiliates of EPCO.  These lease agreements have terms that range from 5 to 30 years.  The agreements to lease office space
from affiliates of EPCO and those relating to underground NGL storage caverns we lease from a third party include renewal options
that could extend these contracts for up to an additional 20 years.  The remainder of our significant lease agreements do not provide
for additional renewal terms.
Lease expense is charged to operating costs and expenses on a straight-line basis over the period of expected economic
benefit.  Contingent rental payments are expensed as incurred.  We are generally required to perform routine maintenance on the
underlying leased assets.  In addition, certain leases give us the option to make leasehold improvements.  Maintenance and repairs
of leased assets resulting from our operations are charged to expense as incurred.  
The following table presents information regarding operating leases where we are the lessee at December 31, 2022:

respectively.
(3)The discount rate for each category of assets represents the weighted average incremental borrowing rate adjusted for collateralization (if the implicit rate is
not determinable).  In general, the discount rates are based on either (i) information available at the lease commencement date or (ii) January 1, 2019 for leases
existing at the adoption date for ASC 842.

Fixed lease expense is charged to earnings on a straight-line basis over the contractual term, with any variable lease payments
expensed as incurred.  Short-term operating lease expense is expensed as incurred.  Cash paid for operating lease liabilities
recorded on our balance sheet was $65 million, and $40 million, and $37 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and
2020, respectively.
We do not have any significant operating or direct financing leases where we are the lessor.  Our operating lease income for the
years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $14 million, $12 million and $11 million, respectively.  We do not have any
sales-type leases.

Purchase Obligations
We define purchase obligations as agreements with remaining terms in excess of one year to purchase goods or services that are
enforceable and legally binding (i.e., unconditional) on us that specify all significant terms, including (i) fixed or minimum
quantities to be purchased, (ii) fixed, minimum or variable price provisions and (iii) the approximate timing of the transactions.  We
classify our unconditional purchase obligations into the following categories:
•Product purchase commitments – We have long-term product purchase obligations for natural gas, NGLs, crude oil, and
petrochemicals and refined products with third party suppliers.  The prices that we are obligated to pay under these contracts
approximate market prices at the time we take delivery of the volumes.  The preceding table presents our estimated future
payment obligations under these contracts based on the contractual price in each agreement at December 31, 2022 applied to
all future volume commitments.  Actual future payment obligations may vary depending on prices at the time of delivery.  
•Service payment commitments – We have long-term commitments to pay service providers, including those attributable to
obligations under firm pipeline transportation contracts.  Payment obligations vary by contract, but generally represent a price
per unit of volume multiplied by a firm transportation volume commitment.
•We have short-term payment obligations relating to our capital expenditures, including our share of the capital expenditures of
unconsolidated affiliates.  These commitments represent unconditional payment obligations for services to be rendered or
products to be delivered in connection with capital projects.
Other Long-Term Liabilities

Note 18.  Significant Risks and Uncertainties
Nature of Operations
We operate predominantly in the midstream energy industry, which includes gathering, transporting, processing, fractionating and
storing natural gas, NGLs, crude oil, and petrochemical and refined products.  As such, changes in the prices of hydrocarbon
products and in the relative price levels among hydrocarbon products could have a material adverse effect on our financial position,
results of operations and cash flows.  Changes in prices may impact demand for hydrocarbon products, which in turn may impact
production, demand and the volumes of products for which we provide services.  In addition, decreases in demand may be caused
by other factors, including prevailing economic conditions, reduced demand by consumers for the end products made with
hydrocarbon products, increased competition, adverse weather conditions, public health emergencies and government regulations
affecting prices and production levels.
F-70
Table of Contents
The natural gas, NGL and crude oil volumes currently transported, gathered or processed at our facilities originate primarily from
existing domestic resource basins, which naturally deplete over time.  To offset this natural decline, our facilities need access to
production from newly discovered properties.  Many economic and business factors beyond our control can adversely affect the
decision by producers to explore for and develop new reserves.  These factors could include relatively low crude oil and natural gas
prices, cost and availability of equipment and labor, regulatory changes, capital budget limitations, the lack of available capital or
the probability of success in finding hydrocarbons.  A decrease in exploration and development activities in the regions where our
facilities and other energy logistics assets are located could result in a decrease in volumes handled by our assets, which could have
a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
Even if crude oil and natural gas reserves exist in the areas served by our assets, we may not be chosen by producers in these areas
to gather, transport, process, fractionate, store or otherwise handle the hydrocarbons extracted.  We compete with other companies
for such production on the basis of many factors, including, but not limited to, geographic proximity to the production, costs of
connection, available capacity, rates and access to markets.
Credit Risk
We may incur credit risk to the extent counterparties do not fulfill their obligations to us in connection with our marketing of
natural gas, NGLs, crude oil, and petrochemicals and refined products and under long-term contracts with minimum volume
commitments or fixed demand charges.  Risks of nonpayment and nonperformance by customers are a major consideration in our
businesses, and our credit procedures and policies may not be adequate to sufficiently eliminate customer credit risk.  Further,
adverse economic conditions in our industry, such as those experienced in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, may
increase the risk of nonpayment and nonperformance by customers, particularly customers that have sub-investment grade credit
ratings or small-scale companies. We manage our exposure to credit risk through credit analysis, credit approvals, credit limits and
monitoring procedures, and for certain transactions may utilize letters of credit, prepayments, net out agreements and
guarantees.  However, these procedures and policies do not fully eliminate customer credit risk.
The primary markets for our services are the Gulf Coast, Southwest, Rocky Mountain, Northeast and Midwest regions of the
U.S.  We have a concentration of trade receivables due from independent and major integrated oil and gas companies and other
pipelines and wholesalers operating in these markets.  These concentrations may affect our overall credit risk in that these energy
industry customers may be similarly affected by adverse changes in economic, regulatory or other factors.  
In those situations where we are exposed to credit risk in our derivative instrument transactions, we analyze the counterparty’s
financial condition prior to entering into an agreement, establish credit and/or margin limits and monitor the appropriateness of
these limits on an ongoing basis.  Generally, we do not require collateral for such transactions nor do we currently anticipate

Insurance Matters
We participate as a named insured in EPCO’s insurance program, which provides us with property damage, business interruption
and other insurance coverage, the scope and amounts of which we believe are customary and prudent for the nature and extent of
our operations.  While we believe EPCO maintains adequate insurance coverage on our behalf, insurance may not fully cover every
type of damage, interruption or other loss that might occur.  If we were to incur a significant loss for which we were not fully
insured, it could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
In addition, there may be timing differences between amounts we accrue related to property damage expense, amounts we are
required to pay in connection with a loss, and amounts we subsequently receive from insurance carriers as reimbursements.  Any
event that materially interrupts the revenues generated by our consolidated operations, or other losses that require us to make
material expenditures not reimbursed by insurance, could reduce our ability to pay distributions to our unitholders and, accordingly,
adversely affect the market price of the Partnership’s common units.

Involuntary conversions result from the loss of an asset due to some unforeseen event (e.g., destruction due to a fire).  Some of
these events are covered by insurance, thus resulting in a property damage insurance recovery.  Amounts we receive from insurance
carriers are net of any deductibles related to the covered event.  We record a receivable from insurance to the extent we recognize a
loss from an involuntary conversion event and the likelihood of our recovering such loss is deemed probable.  To the extent that any
of our insurance claim receivables are later judged not probable of recovery (e.g., due to new information), such amounts are
expensed.  We recognize gains on involuntary conversions when the amount received from insurance exceeds the net book value of
the retired assets.
In addition, we do not recognize gains related to insurance recoveries until all contingencies related to such proceeds have been
resolved, that is, a non-refundable cash payment is received from the insurance carrier or we have a binding settlement agreement
with the carrier that clearly states that a non-refundable payment will be made.  To the extent that an asset is rebuilt, the associated
expenditures are capitalized, as appropriate, on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and presented as “Capital expenditures” on our
Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows.
Under our current insurance program, the standalone deductible for property damage claims is $30 million. We also have business
interruption protection; however, such claims must involve physical damage and have a combined loss value in excess of $30
million and the period of interruption must exceed 60 days. With respect to named windstorm claims, the maximum amount of
insurance coverage available to us for any single event is $200 million, after applying the appropriate deductibles. A named
windstorm is a hurricane, typhoon, tropical storm or cyclone as declared by the U.S. National Weather Service.
