This Annual Report on Form 10-K of Chevron Corporation contains forward-looking statements relating to Chevron’s operations
that are based on management’s current expectations, estimates and projections about the petroleum, chemicals and other energy-
related industries. Words or phrases such as “anticipates,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “targets,” “forecasts,” “projects,”
“believes,” “seeks,” “schedules,” “estimates,” “positions,” “pursues,” “may,” “could,” “should,” “will,” “budgets,” “outlook,”
“trends,” “guidance,” “focus,” “on schedule,” “on track,” “is slated,” “goals,” “objectives,” “strategies,” “opportunities,” “poised”
and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future
performance and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and other factors, many of which are beyond the company’s control and
are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in such
forward-looking statements. The reader should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as
of the date of this report. Unless legally required, Chevron undertakes no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking
statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
Among the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking
statements are: changing crude oil and natural gas prices; changing refining, marketing and chemicals margins; the company’s
ability to realize anticipated cost savings and efficiencies associated with enterprise transformation initiatives; actions of
competitors or regulators; timing of exploration expenses; timing of crude oil liftings; the competitiveness of alternate-energy
sources or product substitutes; technological developments; the results of operations and financial condition of the company’s
suppliers, vendors, partners and equity affiliates, particularly during extended periods of low prices for crude oil and natural gas;
the inability or failure of the company’s joint-venture partners to fund their share of operations and development activities; the
potential failure to achieve expected net production from existing and future crude oil and natural gas development projects;
potential delays in the development, construction or start-up of planned projects; the potential disruption or interruption of the
company’s operations due to war, accidents, political events, civil unrest, severe weather, cyber threats, terrorist acts and public
health crises, such as pandemics and epidemics; crude oil production quotas or other actions that might be imposed by the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other producing countries, or other natural or human causes beyond the
company’s control; changing economic, regulatory and political environments in the various countries in which the company
operates; general domestic and international economic and political conditions; the potential liability for remedial actions or
assessments under existing or future environmental regulations and litigation; significant operational, investment or product
changes required by existing or future environmental statutes and regulations, including international agreements and national or
regional legislation and regulatory measures to limit or reduce greenhouse gas emissions; the potential liability resulting from
pending or future litigation; the company’s future acquisitions or dispositions of assets or shares or the delay or failure of such
transactions to close based on required closing conditions; the potential for gains and losses from asset dispositions or impairments;
government-mandated sales, divestitures, recapitalizations, industry-specific taxes, tariffs, sanctions, changes in fiscal terms or
restrictions on scope of company operations; foreign currency movements compared with the U.S. dollar; material reductions in
corporate liquidity and access to debt markets; the effects of changed accounting rules under generally accepted accounting
principles promulgated by rule-setting bodies; the company’s ability to identify and mitigate the risks and hazards inherent in
operating in the global energy industry; and the factors set forth under the heading “Risk Factors” on pages 18 through 21 in this
report. Other unpredictable or unknown factors not discussed in this report could also have material adverse effects on forward-
looking statements.

General Development of Business
Summary Description of Chevron
Chevron Corporation,* a Delaware corporation, manages its investments in subsidiaries and affiliates and provides administrative,
financial, management and technology support to U.S. and international subsidiaries that engage in integrated energy and chemicals
operations. Upstream operations consist primarily of exploring for, developing and producing crude oil and natural gas; processing,
liquefaction, transportation and regasification associated with liquefied natural gas; transporting crude oil by major international oil
export pipelines; transporting, storage and marketing of natural gas; and a gas-to-liquids plant. Downstream operations consist
primarily of refining crude oil into petroleum products; marketing of crude oil and refined products; transporting crude oil and
refined products by pipeline, marine vessel, motor equipment and rail car; and manufacturing and marketing of commodity
petrochemicals, plastics for industrial uses and fuel and lubricant additives.
A list of the company’s major subsidiaries is presented on page E-1. As of December 31, 2019, Chevron had approximately 48,200
employees (including about 3,500 service station employees). Approximately 25,400 employees (including about 3,200 service
station employees), or 53 percent, were employed in U.S. operations.
Overview of Petroleum Industry
Petroleum industry operations and profitability are influenced by many factors. Prices for crude oil, natural gas, petroleum products
and petrochemicals are generally determined by supply and demand. Production levels from the members of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), Russia and the United States are the major factors in determining worldwide supply.
Demand for crude oil and its products and for natural gas is largely driven by the conditions of local, national and global
economies, although weather patterns and taxation relative to other energy sources also play a significant part. Laws and
governmental policies, particularly in the areas of taxation, energy and the environment, affect where and how companies invest,
conduct their operations and formulate their products and, in some cases, limit their profits directly.
Strong competition exists in all sectors of the petroleum and petrochemical industries in supplying the energy, fuel and chemical
needs of industry and individual consumers. In the upstream business, Chevron competes with fully integrated, major global
petroleum companies, as well as independent and national petroleum companies, for the acquisition of crude oil and natural gas
leases and other properties and for the equipment and labor required to develop and operate those properties. In its downstream
business, Chevron competes with fully integrated, major petroleum companies, as well as independent refining and marketing,
transportation and chemicals entities and national petroleum companies in the refining, manufacturing, sale and marketing of fuels,
lubricants, additives and petrochemicals.
Operating Environment
Refer to pages 28 through 34 of this Form 10-K in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations for a discussion of the company’s current business environment and outlook.
Chevron’s Strategic Direction
Chevron’s primary objective is to deliver industry-leading results and superior shareholder value in any business environment. In
the upstream, the company’s strategy is to deliver industry-leading returns while developing high-value resource opportunities. In
the downstream, the company’s strategy is to grow earnings across the value chain and make targeted investments to lead the
industry in returns. In support of the company’s approach to the energy transition, Chevron is focused on lowering carbon intensity
cost efficiently, increasing the use of renewables in its business, and investing in future breakthrough technologies.
Information about the company is available on the company’s website at www.chevron.com. Information contained on the
company’s website is not part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The company’s Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly
Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and any amendments to these reports filed or furnished pursuant to
Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 are available free of charge on the company’s website soon after such
reports are filed with or furnished to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The reports are also available on the
SEC’s website at www.sec.gov.
________________________________________________________
* Incorporated in Delaware in 1926 as Standard Oil Company of California, the company adopted the name Chevron Corporation in 1984 and ChevronTexaco Corporation in 2001. In
2005, ChevronTexaco Corporation changed its name to Chevron Corporation. As used in this report, the term “Chevron” and such terms as “the company,” “the corporation,” “our,” “we,”
“us” and "its" may refer to Chevron Corporation, one or more of its consolidated subsidiaries, or all of them taken as a whole, but unless stated otherwise they do not include “affiliates”
of Chevron — i.e., those companies accounted for by the equity method (generally owned 50 percent or less) or non-equity method investments. All of these terms are used for
convenience only and are not intended as a precise description of any of the separate companies, each of which manages its own affairs.

Description of Business and Properties
The upstream and downstream activities of the company and its equity affiliates are widely dispersed geographically, with
operations and projects* in North America, South America, Europe, Africa, Asia and Australia. Tabulations of segment sales and
other operating revenues, earnings and income taxes for the three years ending December 31, 2019, and assets as of the end of 2019
and 2018 — for the United States and the company’s international geographic areas — are in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements beginning on page 68. Similar comparative data for the company’s investments in and income from equity affiliates and
property, plant and equipment are in Note 13 beginning on page 71 and Note 16 on page 77. Refer to page 39 of this Form 10-K in
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a discussion of the company’s capital
and exploratory expenditures.
Upstream
Reserves
Refer to Table V beginning on page 96 for a tabulation of the company’s proved crude oil, condensate, natural gas liquids, synthetic
oil and natural gas reserves by geographic area, at the beginning of 2017 and each year-end from 2017 through 2019. Reserves
governance, technologies used in establishing proved reserves additions, and major changes to proved reserves by geographic area
for the three-year period ended December 31, 2019, are summarized in the discussion for Table V. Discussion is also provided
regarding the nature of, status of, and planned future activities associated with the development of proved undeveloped reserves.
The company recognizes reserves for projects with various development periods, sometimes exceeding five years. The external
factors that impact the duration of a project include scope and complexity, remoteness or adverse operating conditions,
infrastructure constraints, and contractual limitations.
At December 31, 2019, 28 percent of the company’s net proved oil-equivalent reserves were located in the United States, 23
percent were located in Australia and 19 percent were located in Kazakhstan.
The net proved reserve balances at the end of each of the three years 2017 through 2019 are shown in the following table:

Delivery Commitments
The company sells crude oil and natural gas from its producing operations under a variety of contractual obligations. Most contracts
generally commit the company to sell quantities based on production from specified properties, but some natural gas sales contracts
specify delivery of fixed and determinable quantities, as discussed below.
In the United States, the company is contractually committed to deliver 951 billion cubic feet of natural gas to third parties from
2020 through 2022. The company believes it can satisfy these contracts through a combination of equity production from the
company’s proved developed U.S. reserves and third-party purchases. These commitments are primarily based on contracts with
indexed pricing terms.
6
Outside the United States, the company is contractually committed to deliver a total of 2,377 billion cubic feet of natural gas to
third parties from 2020 through 2022 from operations in Australia, Colombia, Indonesia and the Philippines. These sales contracts
contain variable pricing formulas that are generally referenced to the prevailing market price for crude oil, natural gas or other
petroleum products at the time of delivery. The company believes it can satisfy these contracts from quantities available from
production of the company’s proved developed reserves in these countries.
Development Activities
Refer to Table I on page 92 for details associated with the company’s development expenditures and costs of proved property
acquisitions for 2019, 2018 and 2017.
The following table summarizes the company’s net interest in productive and dry development wells completed in each of the past
three years, and the status of the company’s development wells drilling at December 31, 2019. A “development well” is a well

Chevron is Australia's largest producer of LNG. During 2019, net daily oil-equivalent production averaged 455,000 barrels.
Australia Upstream activities in Australia are concentrated offshore Western Australia, where the company is the operator of two
major LNG projects, Gorgon and Wheatstone, and has a nonoperated working interest in the North West Shelf (NWS) Venture and
exploration acreage in the Carnarvon Basin and Browse Basin. During 2019, the company's net daily production averaged 45,000
barrels of liquids and 2.5 billion cubic feet of natural gas.
Chevron holds a 47.3 percent-owned and operated interest in the Gorgon Project, which includes the development of the Gorgon
and Jansz-Io fields. The project includes a carbon dioxide sequestration facility, which achieved start-up in August 2019. The
company commenced drilling 11 new wells for Gorgon Stage 2 during 2019. The Gorgon Stage 2 project is expected to be
completed in 2022. Total daily production in 2019 averaged 16,000 barrels of condensate (8,000 barrels net) and 2.3 billion cubic
feet of natural gas (1.1 billion net). The project's estimated economic life exceeds 40 years.
The Jansz-Io Compression Project entered front-end engineering and design in March 2019 and is planned to provide access to
compression for the Jansz-Io field. The project supports maintaining gas supply to the Gorgon LNG plant and maximizing the
recovery of fields accessing the Jansz trunkline.
Chevron holds an 80.2 percent interest in the offshore licenses and a 64.1 percent-owned and operated interest in the LNG facilities
associated with the Wheatstone Project. The project includes the development of the Wheatstone and Iago fields, a two-train, 8.9
million-metric-ton-per-year LNG facility, and a domestic gas plant. The onshore facilities are located at Ashburton North on the
coast of Western Australia. The total production capacity for the Wheatstone and Iago fields and nearby third-party fields is
expected to be approximately 1.6 billion cubic feet of natural gas and 30,000 barrels of condensate per day. Total daily production
averaged 22,000 barrels of condensate (18,000 net) and 1.2 billion cubic feet of natural gas (943 million net) in 2019. The project’s
estimated economic life exceeds 30 years.
Chevron has a 16.7 percent nonoperated working interest in the NWS Venture in Western Australia.
Chevron holds 50 percent-owned and operated interests in four exploration permits in the northern Carnarvon Basin. Chevron
continued to evaluate exploration potential in the Carnarvon Basin during 2019. The company holds nonoperated working interests
ranging from 24.8 percent to 50 percent in three exploration blocks in the Browse Basin. Relinquishment of Chevron’s offshore
blocks in the Bight Basin was finalized in April 2019.
Chevron has a 100 percent-owned and operated interest in the Clio, Acme and Acme West fields. The company is collaborating
with other Carnarvon Basin participants to assess the opportunity of Clio Acme being developed through shared utilization of
existing infrastructure.
New Zealand In September 2019, Chevron relinquished its 50 percent operated interest in three deepwater exploration permits in
the offshore Pegasus and East Coast basins.
Sales of Natural Gas and Natural Gas Liquids
 The company sells natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGLs) from its producing operations under a variety of contractual
arrangements. In addition, the company also makes third-party purchases and sales of natural gas and NGLs in connection with its
supply and trading activities.
During 2019, U.S. and international sales of natural gas averaged 4.0 billion and 5.9 billion cubic feet per day, respectively, which
includes the company’s share of equity affiliates’ sales. Outside the United States, substantially all of the natural gas sales from the
company’s producing interests are from operations in Angola, Argentina, Australia, Bangladesh, Canada, Colombia, Kazakhstan,
Indonesia, Myanmar, Nigeria, the Philippines, Thailand and the United Kingdom.
U.S. and international sales of NGLs averaged 231,000 and 106,000 barrels per day, respectively, in 2019.

Downstream
Refining Operations
At the end of 2019, the company had a refining network capable of processing 1.7 million barrels of crude oil per day. Operable
capacity at December 31, 2019, and daily refinery inputs for 2017 through 2019 for the company and affiliate refineries are
summarized in the table below.
Average crude oil distillation capacity utilization was 90 percent in 2019 and 93 percent in 2018. At the U.S. refineries, crude oil
distillation capacity utilization averaged 91 percent in 2019, compared with 97 percent in 2018. Chevron processes both imported
and domestic crude oil in its U.S. refining operations. Imported crude oil accounted for about 65 percent and 70 percent of
Chevron’s U.S. refinery inputs in 2019 and 2018, respectively.
In the United States, the company continued work on projects to improve refinery flexibility and reliability. At the Richmond
Refinery in California, production on the new hydrogen plant reached full operational capacity in January 2019. At the refinery in
Salt Lake City, Utah, construction continued on the alkylation retrofit project with more than 100 modules installed. Project start-up
is expected in first-half 2021.
In May 2019, the company completed the acquisition of the Pasadena refinery in Texas. The Pasadena Refinery has the capacity to
process 110,000 barrels per day of light crude oil and enables the company to leverage its Permian Basin upstream assets.
Outside the United States, the company has three large refineries in South Korea, Singapore and Thailand. The Singapore Refining
Company (SRC), a 50 percent-owned joint venture, has a total capacity of 290,000 barrels of crude per day and manufactures a
wide range of petroleum products. Recent upgrades have enabled SRC to produce higher-quality gasoline that meets stricter
emission standards. The 50 percent-owned, GS Caltex (GSC) operated, Yeosu Refinery in South Korea remains one of the world’s
largest refineries with a total crude capacity of 800,000 barrels per day. In February 2019, a final investment decision was reached
on the olefins mixed-feed cracker and associated polyethylene unit with first production planned for 2021. The company’s 60.6
percent-owned refinery in Map Ta Phut, Thailand, continues to supply high-quality petroleum products through the Caltex brand
into regional markets.

or through retailers and marketers to approximately 7,900 Chevron- and Texaco- branded service stations, primarily in the southern
and western states. Approximately 310 of these outlets are company-owned or -leased stations.
Outside the United States, Chevron supplied directly or through retailers and marketers approximately 5,100 branded service
stations, including affiliates. The company markets in Latin America using the Texaco brand. In 2019, Chevron continued to grow,
expanding to nearly 200 branded stations in northwestern Mexico at the end of the year. The company also operates through
affiliates under various brand names. In the Asia-Pacific region and the Middle East, the company uses the Caltex brand. In South
Korea, the company operates through its 50 percent-owned affiliate, GSC.
In December 2019, the company signed an agreement to acquire a network of terminals and service stations in Australia, which is
expected to close in second-half 2020, pending regulatory approval.
Chevron markets commercial aviation fuel at approximately 70 airports worldwide. The company also markets an extensive line of
lubricant and coolant products under the product names Havoline, Delo, Ursa, Meropa, Rando, Clarity and Taro in the United
States and worldwide under the three brands: Chevron, Texaco and Caltex.
Chemicals Operations
Chevron Oronite Company develops, manufactures and markets performance additives for lubricating oils and fuels and conducts
research and development for additive component and blended packages. At the end of 2019, the company manufactured, blended
or conducted research at 10 locations around the world. Construction progressed in 2019 on a lubricant additive blending and
shipping plant in Ningbo, China. Commercial production is anticipated to begin in 2021.
Chevron owns a 50 percent interest in its Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC (CPChem) affiliate. CPChem produces olefins,
polyolefins and alpha olefins and is a supplier of aromatics and polyethylene pipe, in addition to participating in the specialty
chemical and specialty plastics markets. At the end of 2019, CPChem owned or had joint-venture interests in 28 manufacturing
facilities and two research and development centers around the world.
In 2019, CPChem announced agreements to jointly develop petrochemical complexes in Qatar and the U.S. Gulf Coast.
Engineering and design for these projects is underway.
Chevron also maintains a role in the petrochemical business through the operations of GSC, the company’s 50 percent-owned
affiliate. GSC manufactures aromatics, including benzene, toluene and xylene. These base chemicals are used to produce a range of
products, including adhesives, plastics and textile fibers. GSC also produces polypropylene, which is used to make automotive and
home appliance parts, food packaging, laboratory equipment and textiles.
16
GSC reached a final investment decision in February 2019 to build an olefins mixed-feed cracker and polyethylene unit within the
existing refining and aromatics facilities in Yeosu, South Korea.
Transportation
Pipelines Chevron owns and operates a network of crude oil, natural gas and product pipelines and other infrastructure assets in the
United States. In addition, Chevron operates pipelines for its 50 percent-owned CPChem affiliate. The company also has direct and
indirect interests in other U.S. and international pipelines.
Refer to pages 11 through 13 in the Upstream section for information on the West African Gas Pipeline, the Baku-Tbilisi- Ceyhan
Pipeline, and the Caspian Pipeline Consortium.
Shipping The company’s marine fleet includes both U.S. and foreign flagged vessels. The operated fleet consists of conventional
crude tankers, product carriers and LNG carriers. These vessels transport crude oil, LNG, refined products and feedstock in support
of the company’s global upstream and downstream businesses.
Other Businesses
Research and Technology Chevron’s energy technology organization supports upstream and downstream businesses. The company
conducts research, develops and qualifies technology, and provides technical services and competency development. The
disciplines cover earth sciences, reservoir and production engineering, drilling and completions, facilities engineering,
manufacturing, process technology, catalysis, technical computing and health, environment and safety.
Chevron’s information technology organization integrates computing, telecommunications, data management, cybersecurity and
network technology to provide a digital infrastructure to enable Chevron’s global operations and business processes.
In 2019, Chevron continued its involvement in the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative (OGCI), a global collaboration focused on the
industry’s efforts to take actions to accelerate and participate in the energy transition. OGCI members seek to lower carbon
footprints of energy, industry, and transportation value chains. This includes work to reduce methane emissions, reduce the carbon
intensity of upstream oil and gas emissions, and facilitate large-scale commercial investment in carbon capture, use and storage.
OGCI Climate Investments is a $1 billion-plus investment fund set up by the OGCI member companies. OGCI Climate
Investments focuses on three objectives: reducing methane emissions during the production, delivery and usage of oil and gas;
reducing carbon dioxide emissions by increasing energy efficiency in power, industry and transport; and recycling and storing
carbon dioxide produced during power generation or industrial processes by using it in products or storing it. As a member of
OGCI, Chevron has committed to contribute $100 million to this fund.
Chevron’s technology ventures unit supports Chevron’s upstream and downstream businesses by bridging the gap between business
unit needs and emerging technology solutions developed externally in areas of emerging materials, water management, information
technology, power systems and production enhancement. In 2018, Chevron established the Chevron Future Energy Fund with an
initial commitment of $100 million to invest in breakthrough technologies that enable the ongoing energy transition. Our
investments and partnerships have focused on areas such as alternative energy and emerging technologies, transportation and
infrastructure, capturing and reducing emissions, and energy storage.
Some of the investments the company makes in the areas described above are in new or unproven technologies and business
processes, and ultimate technical or commercial successes are not certain. Refer to Note 25 on page 89 for a summary of the
company’s research and development expenses.
Environmental Protection The company designs, operates and maintains its facilities to avoid potential spills or leaks and to
minimize the impact of those that may occur. Chevron requires its facilities and operations to have operating standards and
processes and emergency response plans that address significant risks identified through site-specific risk and impact assessments.
Chevron also requires that sufficient resources be available to execute these plans. In the unlikely event that a major spill or leak
occurs, Chevron also maintains a Worldwide Emergency Response Team comprised of employees who are trained in various
aspects of emergency response, including post-incident remediation.
To complement the company’s capabilities, Chevron maintains active membership in international oil spill response cooperatives,
including the Marine Spill Response Corporation, which operates in U.S. territorial waters, and Oil Spill Response, Ltd., which
operates globally. The company is a founding member of the Marine Well Containment Company, whose primary mission is to
expediently deploy containment equipment and systems to capture and contain crude oil in the unlikely event of a future loss of
control of a deepwater well in the Gulf of Mexico. In addition, the company is a member of
17
the Subsea Well Response Project, which has the objective to further develop the industry’s capability to contain and shut in subsea
well control incidents in different regions of the world.
The company is committed to improving energy efficiency in its day-to-day operations and is required to comply with the
greenhouse gas-related laws and regulations to which it is subject. Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors on pages 18 through 21 for
further discussion of greenhouse gas regulation and climate change and the associated risks to Chevron’s business.
Refer to Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations on page 44 for additional
information on environmental matters and their impact on Chevron, and on the company’s 2019 environmental expenditures. Refer
to page 44 and Note 22 beginning on page 87 for a discussion of environmental remediation provisions and year-end reserves.
Item 1A. Risk Factors
Chevron is a global energy company and its operating and financial results are subject to a variety of risks inherent in the global oil,
gas, and petrochemical businesses. Many of these risks are not within the company’s control and could materially impact the
company’s results of operations and financial condition.
Chevron is exposed to the effects of changing commodity prices Chevron is primarily in a commodities business that has a history
of price volatility. The single largest variable that affects the company’s results of operations is the price of crude oil, which can be
influenced by general economic conditions, industry production and inventory levels, technology advancements, production quotas
or other actions that might be imposed by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) or other producers, weather-
related damage and disruptions due to other natural or human causes beyond our control, competing fuel prices, and geopolitical
risks. Chevron evaluates the risk of changing commodity prices as a core part of its business planning process. An investment in the
company carries significant exposure to fluctuations in global crude oil prices.
Extended periods of low prices for crude oil can have a material adverse impact on the company’s results of operations, financial
condition and liquidity. Among other things, the company’s upstream earnings, cash flows, and capital and exploratory expenditure
programs could be negatively affected, as could its production and proved reserves. Upstream assets may also become impaired.
Downstream earnings could be negatively affected because they depend upon the supply and demand for refined products and the
associated margins on refined product sales. A significant or sustained decline in liquidity could adversely affect the company’s
credit ratings, potentially increase financing costs and reduce access to capital markets. The company may be unable to realize
anticipated cost savings, expenditure reductions and asset sales that are intended to compensate for such downturns. In some cases,
liabilities associated with divested assets may return to the company when an acquirer of those assets subsequently declares
bankruptcy. In addition, extended periods of low commodity prices can have a material adverse impact on the results of operations,
financial condition and liquidity of the company’s suppliers, vendors, partners and equity affiliates upon which the company’s own
results of operations and financial condition depends.
The scope of Chevron’s business will decline if the company does not successfully develop resources The company is in an
extractive business; therefore, if it is not successful in replacing the crude oil and natural gas it produces with good prospects for
future organic opportunities or through acquisitions, the company’s business will decline. Creating and maintaining an inventory of
projects depends on many factors, including obtaining and renewing rights to explore, develop and produce hydrocarbons; drilling
success; reservoir optimization; ability to bring long-lead-time, capital-intensive projects to completion on budget and on schedule;
and efficient and profitable operation of mature properties.
The company’s operations could be disrupted by natural or human causes beyond its control Chevron operates in both urban
areas and remote and sometimes inhospitable regions. The company’s operations are therefore subject to disruption from natural or
human causes beyond its control, including physical risks from hurricanes, severe storms, floods and other forms of severe weather,
war, accidents, civil unrest, political events, fires, earthquakes, system failures, cyber threats, terrorist acts and epidemic or
pandemic diseases such as the coronavirus, any of which could result in suspension of operations or harm to people or the natural
environment.
Chevron’s risk management systems are designed to assess potential physical and other risks to its operations and assets and to plan
for their resiliency. While capital investment reviews and decisions incorporate potential ranges of physical risks such as storm
severity and frequency, sea level rise, air and water temperature, precipitation, fresh water access, wind speed, and earthquake
severity, among other factors, it is difficult to predict with certainty the timing, frequency or severity of such events, any of which
could have a material adverse effect on the company's results of operations or financial condition.
18
Cyberattacks targeting Chevron’s process control networks or other digital infrastructure could have a material adverse impact
on the company’s business and results of operations There are numerous and evolving risks to Chevron’s cybersecurity and
privacy from cyber threat actors, including criminal hackers, state-sponsored intrusions, industrial espionage and employee
malfeasance. These cyber threat actors, whether internal or external to Chevron, are becoming more sophisticated and coordinated
in their attempts to access the company’s information technology (IT) systems and data, including the IT systems of cloud
providers and other third parties with whom the company conducts business. Although Chevron devotes significant resources to
prevent unwanted intrusions and to protect its systems and data, whether such data is housed internally or by external third parties,
the company has experienced and will continue to experience cyber incidents of varying degrees in the conduct of its business.
Cyber threat actors could compromise the company’s process control networks or other critical systems and infrastructure, resulting
in disruptions to its business operations, injury to people, harm to the environment or its assets, disruptions in access to its financial
reporting systems, or loss, misuse or corruption of its critical data and proprietary information, including without limitation its
intellectual property and business information and that of its employees, customers, partners and other third parties. Any of the
foregoing can be exacerbated by a delay or failure to detect a cyber incident. Further, the company has exposure to cyber incidents
and the negative impacts of such incidents related to its critical data and proprietary information housed on third-party IT systems,
including the cloud. Additionally, authorized third-party IT systems can be compromised and used to gain access or introduce
malware to Chevron's IT systems during the normal course of business. The company has limited control and visibility over such
third-party IT systems. Cyber events could result in significant financial losses, legal or regulatory violations, reputational harm,
and legal liability and could ultimately have a material adverse effect on the company’s business and results of operations.
The company’s operations have inherent risks and hazards that require significant and continuous oversight Chevron’s results
depend on its ability to identify and mitigate the risks and hazards inherent to operating in the crude oil and natural gas industry.
The company seeks to minimize these operational risks by carefully designing and building its facilities and conducting its
operations in a safe and reliable manner. However, failure to manage these risks effectively could impair our ability to operate and
result in unexpected incidents, including releases, explosions or mechanical failures resulting in personal injury, loss of life,
environmental damage, loss of revenues, legal liability and/or disruption to operations. Chevron has implemented and maintains a
system of corporate policies, processes and systems, behaviors and compliance mechanisms to manage safety, health,
environmental, reliability and efficiency risks; to verify compliance with applicable laws and policies; and to respond to and learn
from unexpected incidents. In certain situations where Chevron is not the operator, the company may have limited influence and
control over third parties, which may limit its ability to manage and control such risks.
Chevron’s business subjects the company to liability risks from litigation or government action The company produces,
transports, refines and markets potentially hazardous materials, and it purchases, handles and disposes of other potentially
hazardous materials in the course of its business. Chevron's operations also produce byproducts, which may be considered
pollutants. Often these operations are conducted through joint ventures over which the company may have limited influence and
control. Any of these activities could result in liability or significant delays in operations arising from private litigation or
government action. For example, liability or delays could result from an accidental, unlawful discharge or from new conclusions
about the effects of the company’s operations on human health or the environment. In addition, to the extent that societal pressures
or political or other factors are involved, it is possible that such liability could be imposed without regard to the company’s
causation of or contribution to the asserted damage, or to other mitigating factors.
For information concerning some of the litigation in which the company is involved, see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements, beginning on page 72.
The company does not insure against all potential losses, which could result in significant financial exposure The company does
not have commercial insurance or third-party indemnities to fully cover all operational risks or potential liability in the event of a
significant incident or series of incidents causing catastrophic loss. As a result, the company is, to a substantial extent, self-insured
for such events. The company relies on existing liquidity, financial resources and borrowing capacity to meet short-term obligations
that would arise from such an event or series of events. The occurrence of a significant incident or unforeseen liability for which
the company is self-insured, not fully insured or for which insurance recovery is significantly delayed could have a material adverse
effect on the company’s results of operations or financial condition.
Political instability and significant changes in the legal and regulatory environment could harm Chevron’s business The
company’s operations, particularly exploration and production, can be affected by changing economic, regulatory and political
environments in the various countries in which it operates. As has occurred in the past, actions could be taken by governments to
increase public ownership of the company’s partially or wholly owned businesses, to force contract renegotiations, or to impose
additional taxes or royalties. In certain locations, governments have proposed or imposed
19
restrictions on the company’s operations, trade, currency exchange controls, burdensome taxes, and public disclosure requirements
that might harm the company’s competitiveness or relations with other governments or third parties. In other countries, political
conditions have existed that may threaten the safety of employees and the company’s continued presence in those countries, and
internal unrest, acts of violence or strained relations between a government and the company or other governments may adversely
affect the company’s operations. Those developments have, at times, significantly affected the company’s operations and results
and are carefully considered by management when evaluating the level of current and future activity in such countries. Further,
Chevron is required to comply with U.S. sanctions and other trade laws and regulations which, depending upon their scope, could
adversely impact the company's operations in certain countries. For example, with respect to our operations in Venezuela as
discussed in Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Other Contingencies and Commitments - Other Contingencies,”
future events could result in the environment in Venezuela becoming more challenged, which could lead to increased business
disruption and volatility in the associated financial results. In addition, litigation or changes in national, state or local environmental
regulations or laws, including those designed to stop or impede the development or production of oil and gas, such as those related
to the use of hydraulic fracturing or bans on drilling, could adversely affect the company’s current or anticipated future operations
and profitability.
Regulation of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions has increased and could continue to increase Chevron’s operational costs and
reduce demand for Chevron’s hydrocarbon and other products In the years ahead, companies in the energy industry, like
Chevron, may be challenged by a further increase in international and domestic regulation relating to GHG emissions.  Like any
significant changes in the regulatory environment, GHG regulation could have the impact of curtailing profitability in the oil and
gas sector or rendering the extraction of the company’s oil and gas resources economically infeasible.  Although the IEA’s World
Energy Outlook scenarios anticipate oil and gas continuing to make up a significant portion of the global energy mix through 2040
and beyond given their respective advantages in transportation and power generation, if a new onset of regulation contributes to a
decline in the demand for the company’s products, this could have a material adverse effect on the company and its financial
condition.
International agreements and national, regional and state legislation and regulatory measures that aim to limit or reduce GHG
emissions are currently in various stages of implementation. For example, the Paris Agreement went into effect in November 2016,
and a number of countries are studying and may adopt additional policies to meet their Paris Agreement goals. In some
jurisdictions, the company is already subject to currently implemented programs such as the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard
program, the European Union Emissions Trading System, and the California cap-and-trade program and related low carbon fuel
standard obligations. Other jurisdictions are considering adopting or are in the process of implementing laws or regulations to
directly regulate GHG emissions through similar or other mechanisms such as, for example, via a carbon tax (e.g., Singapore and
Canada) or via a cap-and-trade program (e.g., California, Mexico and China). The landscape continues to be in a state of constant
re-assessment and legal challenge with respect to these laws and regulations, making it difficult to predict with certainty the
ultimate impact they will have on the company in the aggregate.
GHG emissions-related laws and related regulations and the effects of operating in a potentially carbon-constrained environment
may result in increased and substantial capital, compliance, operating and maintenance costs and could, among other things, reduce
demand for hydrocarbons and the company’s hydrocarbon-based products, make the company’s products more expensive,
adversely affect the economic feasibility of the company’s resources, and adversely affect the company’s sales volumes, revenues
and margins. GHG emissions (e.g., carbon dioxide and methane) that could be regulated include, among others, those associated
with the company’s exploration and production of hydrocarbons such as crude oil and natural gas; the upgrading of production
from oil sands into synthetic oil; power generation; the conversion of crude oil and natural gas into refined hydrocarbon products;
the processing, liquefaction and regasification of natural gas; the transportation of crude oil, natural gas and related products and
consumers’ or customers’ use of the company’s hydrocarbon products. Many of these activities, such as consumers’ and customers’
use of the company’s products and substitute products, as well as actions taken by the company’s competitors in response to such
laws and regulations, are beyond the company’s control.
Consideration of GHG issues and the responses to those issues through international agreements and national, regional or state
legislation or regulations are integrated into the company’s strategy and planning, capital investment reviews, and risk management
tools and processes, where applicable. They are also factored into the company’s long-range supply, demand and energy price
forecasts. These forecasts reflect long-range effects from renewable fuel penetration, energy efficiency standards, climate-related
policy actions, and demand response to oil and natural gas prices. Additionally, the company assesses carbon pricing risks by
considering carbon costs in these forecasts. The actual level of expenditure required to comply with new or potential climate
change-related laws and regulations and amount of additional investments in new or
20
existing technology or facilities, such as carbon dioxide injection, is difficult to predict with certainty and is expected to vary
depending on the actual laws and regulations enacted in a jurisdiction, the company’s activities in it and market conditions.
The ultimate effect of international agreements and national, regional and state legislation and regulatory measures to limit GHG
emissions on the company’s financial performance, and the timing of these effects, will depend on a number of factors. Such
factors include, among others, the sectors covered, the GHG emissions reductions required, the extent to which Chevron would be
entitled to receive emission allowance allocations or would need to purchase compliance instruments on the open market or through
auctions, the price and availability of emission allowances and credits, and the extent to which the company is able to recover the
costs incurred through the pricing of the company’s products in the competitive marketplace. Further, the ultimate impact of GHG
emissions-related agreements, legislation and measures on the company’s financial performance is highly uncertain because the
company is unable to predict with certainty, for a multitude of individual jurisdictions, the outcome of political decision-making
processes and the variables and tradeoffs that inevitably occur in connection with such processes.
Increasing attention to environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters may impact our business Increasing attention to
climate change, increasing societal expectations on companies to address climate change, and potential consumer and customer use
of substitutes to Chevron’s products may result in increased costs, reduced demand for our products, reduced profits, increased
investigations and litigation, and negative impacts on our stock price and access to capital markets. Increasing attention to climate
change, for example, may result in demand shifts for our hydrocarbon products and additional governmental investigations and
private litigation against the company.
In addition, organizations that provide information to investors on corporate governance and related matters have developed ratings
processes for evaluating companies on their approach to ESG matters. Such ratings are used by some investors to inform their
investment and voting decisions. Unfavorable ESG ratings may lead to increased negative investor sentiment toward Chevron and

Changes in management’s estimates and assumptions may have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial
statements and financial or operational performance in any given period In preparing the company’s periodic reports under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, including its financial statements, Chevron’s management is required under applicable rules and
regulations to make estimates and assumptions as of a specified date. These estimates and assumptions are based on management’s
best estimates and experience as of that date and are subject to substantial risk and uncertainty. Materially different results may
occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known. Areas requiring significant estimates and assumptions
by management include impairments to property, plant and equipment; estimates of crude oil and natural gas recoverable reserves;
accruals for estimated liabilities, including litigation reserves; and measurement of benefit obligations for pension and other
postretirement benefit plans. Changes in estimates or assumptions or the information underlying the assumptions, such as changes
in the company’s business plans, general market conditions or changes in commodity prices, could affect reported amounts of
assets, liabilities or expenses.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings
Governmental Proceedings The following is a description of legal proceedings that the company has determined to disclose for
this reporting period that involve governmental authorities and certain monetary sanctions under federal, state and local laws that
have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or primarily for the purpose of protecting
the environment.
As previously disclosed, the refinery in Pasadena, Texas acquired by Chevron on May 1, 2019 (Pasadena Refining System, Inc. and
PRSI Trading LLC) has multiple outstanding Notices of Violation (NOVs) that were issued by the Texas
21
Commission on Environmental Quality related to air emissions at the refinery. The Pasadena refinery is currently negotiating a
resolution of the NOVs with the Texas Attorney General. Resolution of the alleged violations may result in the payment of a civil
penalty of $100,000 or more. 
Chevron facilities within the jurisdiction of California’s Bay Area Air Quality Management District (BAAQMD) currently have
multiple outstanding NOVs issued by BAAQMD. Resolution of the alleged violations may result in the payment of a civil penalty
of $100,000 or more. As previously disclosed, on April 24, 2019, Chevron received a proposal from the BAAQMD seeking to
resolve certain NOVs related to alleged violations that occurred at Chevron’s refinery in Richmond, California, and the Richmond
terminal between 2016 and 2018. Resolution of the alleged violations may result in the payment of a civil penalty of $100,000 or
more.
Chevron facilities within the jurisdiction of California’s South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) currently have
multiple outstanding NOVs issued by SCAQMD. Resolution of the alleged violations may result in the payment of a civil penalty
of $100,000 or more. As previously disclosed, on April 25 and August 21, 2019, Chevron received correspondence from SCAQMD
seeking to resolve certain NOVs related to alleged violations that occurred at Chevron’s refinery in El Segundo, California,
between 2018 and 2019. Resolution of the alleged violations may result in the payment of a civil penalty of $100,000 or more.
As previously disclosed, the California Department of Conservation, California Geologic Energy Management Division (CalGEM)
(previously known as the Division of Oil, Gas and Geothermal Resources) promulgated revised rules pursuant to the Underground
Injection Control program that took effect April 1, 2019. Subsequent to that date, CalGEM issued NOVs and two orders to Chevron
related to seeps that occurred in the Cymric Oil Field in Kern County, California. An October 2, 2019, CalGEM order seeks a civil
penalty of approximately $2.7 million. Chevron has filed an appeal of this order. Other state agencies may become engaged in this
matter as well. Resolution of this matter may result in the payment of civil penalties of $100,000 or more.
Other Proceedings Information related to other legal proceedings is included beginning on page 72 in Note 14 to the Consolidated

the three years ended December 31, 2019.
Business Environment and Outlook
Chevron is a global energy company with substantial business activities in the following countries: Angola, Argentina, Australia,
Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Myanmar, Mexico, Nigeria, the Partitioned
Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, the Philippines, Republic of Congo, Singapore, South Korea, Thailand, the United
Kingdom, the United States, and Venezuela.
Earnings of the company depend mostly on the profitability of its upstream business segment. The most significant factor affecting
the results of operations for the upstream segment is the price of crude oil, which is determined in global markets outside of the
company’s control. In the company’s downstream business, crude oil is the largest cost component of refined products. It is the
company’s objective to deliver competitive results and stockholder value in any business environment. Periods of sustained lower
prices could result in the impairment or write-off of specific assets in future periods and cause the company to adjust operating
expenses and capital and exploratory expenditures, along with other measures intended to improve financial performance.
Similarly, impairments or write-offs may occur as a result of managerial decisions not to progress certain projects in the company's
portfolio.
The effective tax rate for the company can change substantially during periods of significant earnings volatility. This is due to the
mix effects that are impacted both by the absolute level of earnings or losses and whether they arise in higher or lower tax rate
jurisdictions. As a result, a decline or increase in the effective income tax rate in one period may not be indicative of expected
results in future periods. Note 15 provides the company’s effective income tax rate for the last three years.
Refer to the “Cautionary Statements Relevant to Forward-Looking Information” on page 2 and to “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A,
on pages 18 through 21 for a discussion of some of the inherent risks that could materially impact the company’s results of
operations or financial condition.
The company continually evaluates opportunities to dispose of assets that are not expected to provide sufficient long-term value or
to acquire assets or operations complementary to its asset base to help augment the company’s financial performance and value
growth. Asset dispositions and restructurings may result in significant gains or losses in future periods. The company’s
28
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
asset sale program for 2018 through 2020 is targeting before-tax proceeds of $5-10 billion. Proceeds related to asset sales were $2.0
billion in 2018 and $2.8 billion in 2019.
The company closely monitors developments in the financial and credit markets, the level of worldwide economic activity, and the
implications for the company of movements in prices for crude oil and natural gas. Management takes these developments into
account in the conduct of daily operations and for business planning.
Comments related to earnings trends for the company’s major business areas are as follows:
Upstream Earnings for the upstream segment are closely aligned with industry prices for crude oil and natural gas. Crude oil and
natural gas prices are subject to external factors over which the company has no control, including product demand connected with
global economic conditions, industry production and inventory levels, technology advancements, production quotas or other actions
imposed by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) or other producers, actions of regulators, weather-related
damage and disruptions, competing fuel prices, and regional supply interruptions or fears thereof that may be caused by military
conflicts, civil unrest or political uncertainty. Any of these factors could also inhibit the company’s production capacity in an
affected region. The company closely monitors developments in the countries in which it operates and holds investments, and seeks
to manage risks in operating its facilities and businesses. The longer-term trend in earnings for the upstream segment is also a
function of other factors, including the company’s ability to find or acquire and efficiently produce crude oil and natural gas,
changes in fiscal terms of contracts, and changes in tax and other applicable laws and regulations.
The company continues to actively manage its schedule of work, contracting, procurement, and supply-chain activities to
effectively manage costs and support operational goals. Price levels for capital, exploratory costs, and operating expenses
associated with the production of crude oil and natural gas can be subject to external factors beyond the company’s control
including, but not limited to: the general level of inflation, tariffs or other taxes imposed on goods or services, and commoditized
prices charged by the industry’s material and service providers. The spot markets for many services and materials fell as overall
industry drilling activity in North America declined in 2019, particularly onshore. However, as industry activity contracts, financial
pressure on suppliers has increased, which may limit further de-escalation and/or lead to consolidation across the supplier
community impacting costs. The international and offshore rig markets are also showing some signs of weaknesses as activity has
pulled back; however, pricing for some products and services remains resilient as many suppliers have reset expectations of higher
industry spend and instead are looking to higher pricing and margins on a more limited scope of work. Chevron utilizes contracts
with various pricing mechanisms, so there may be a delay in when the company’s costs reflect the changes in market trends.
Capital and exploratory expenditures and operating expenses could also be affected by damage to production facilities caused by
severe weather or civil unrest, delays in construction, or other factors.
The chart above shows the trend in benchmark prices for Brent crude oil, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil and U.S. Henry
Hub natural gas. The majority of the company’s equity crude production is priced based on the Brent benchmark. The Brent price
averaged $64 per barrel for the full-year 2019, compared to $71 in 2018. Brent prices increased through the first half of 2019 due to
OPEC production cuts and U.S. sanctions on Iran and Venezuela. Prices then started to decline due to heightened concerns about a
slowing macro economy and weakening oil demand growth amid trade tensions between the
29
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
U.S. and China. OPEC announced additional production cuts in December 2019, leading to a price increase with Brent prices at
$67 at the end of the year. As of mid-February 2020, the Brent price was $57 per barrel, having declined more than 10 percent since
December 2019, primarily due to concerns about demand erosion following the coronavirus outbreak.
The WTI price averaged $57 per barrel for the full-year 2019, compared to $65 in 2018. WTI traded at a discount to Brent
throughout 2019. Differentials to Brent have ranged between $4 to $10 in 2019, primarily due to pipeline infrastructure constraints
which have restricted flows of inland crude to export outlets on the Gulf Coast. Variability in other factors impacting supply and
demand of each benchmark crude also affect price differential. As of mid-February 2020, the WTI price was $52 per barrel.
Chevron has interests in the production of heavy crude oil in California, Indonesia, the Partitioned Zone between Saudi Arabia and
Kuwait, Venezuela and in certain fields in Angola and China. (See page 37 for the company’s average U.S. and international crude
oil sales prices.)
In contrast to price movements in the global market for crude oil, price changes for natural gas are more closely aligned with
seasonal supply-and-demand and infrastructure conditions in local markets. In the United States, prices at Henry Hub averaged
$2.53 per thousand cubic feet (MCF) during 2019, compared with $3.12 during 2018. As of mid-February 2020, the Henry Hub
spot price was $1.84 per MCF. Increased production in the Permian Basin has resulted in insufficient gas pipeline and fractionation
capacity in the near-term, and over-supply conditions, leading to depressed natural gas and natural gas liquids prices in West Texas.
A sizable portion of Chevron’s U.S. natural gas production comes from the Permian Basin, resulting in natural gas realizations that
are significantly lower than the Henry Hub price.
Outside the United States, price changes for natural gas depend on a wide range of supply, demand and regulatory circumstances.
Chevron sells natural gas into the domestic pipeline market in many locations. In some locations, Chevron has invested in long-
term projects to produce and liquefy natural gas for transport by tanker to other markets. The company’s long-term contract prices
for liquefied natural gas (LNG) are typically linked to crude oil prices. Most of the equity LNG offtake from the operated
Australian LNG projects is committed under binding long-term contracts, with the remainder to be sold in the Asian spot LNG
market.  The Asian spot market reflects the supply and demand for LNG in the Pacific Basin and is not directly linked to crude oil
prices. International natural gas realizations averaged $5.83 per MCF during 2019, compared with $6.29 per MCF during 2018.
(See page 37 for the company’s average natural gas realizations for the U.S. and international regions.)
The company’s worldwide net oil-equivalent production in 2019 averaged 3.058 million barrels per day. About 15 percent of the
company’s net oil-equivalent production in 2019 occurred in the OPEC-member countries of Angola, Nigeria, Republic of Congo
and Venezuela. OPEC quotas had no material effect on the company’s net crude oil production in 2019 or 2018.
The company estimates that net oil-equivalent production in 2020 will grow up to 3 percent compared to 2019, assuming a Brent
crude oil price of $60 per barrel and excluding the impact of anticipated 2020 asset sales. This estimate is subject to many factors
and uncertainties, including quotas or other actions that may be imposed by OPEC; tariffs and trade sanctions; price effects on
entitlement volumes; changes in fiscal terms or restrictions on the scope of company operations; delays in construction; reservoir
performance; greater-than-expected declines in production from mature fields; start-up or ramp-up of projects; fluctuations in
demand for natural gas in various markets; weather conditions that may shut in production; civil unrest; changing geopolitics;
delays in completion of maintenance turnarounds; or other disruptions to operations. The outlook for future production levels is
also affected by the size and number of economic investment opportunities and the time lag between initial exploration and the
beginning of production. The company has increased its investment emphasis on short-cycle projects.
In the Partitioned Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, production was shut-in beginning in May 2015 as a result of difficulties
in securing work and equipment permits. Net oil-equivalent production in the Partitioned Zone in 2014 was 81,000 barrels per day.
During 2015, net oil-equivalent production averaged 28,000 barrels per day. In December 2019, the governments of Saudi Arabia
and Kuwait signed a memorandum of understanding to resolve the dispute and allow production to restart in the Partitioned Zone.
In mid-February 2020, pre-startup activities commenced. The financial effects from the loss of production in 2019 were not
significant and are not expected to be significant in 2020.
Chevron has interests in Venezuelan crude oil production assets operated by independent equity affiliates. While the operating
environment in Venezuela has been deteriorating for some time, the equity affiliates have continued to operate consistent with the
authorization provided pursuant to general licenses issued by the United States government. It remains uncertain when the
environment in Venezuela will stabilize, but the company remains committed to its personnel and operations in
30
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Venezuela. Refer to Note 22 on page 88 under the heading “Other Contingencies” for more information on the company’s activities
in Venezuela.
Net proved reserves for consolidated companies and affiliated companies totaled 11.4 billion barrels of oil-equivalent at year-end
2019, a decrease of 5 percent from year-end 2018. The reserve replacement ratio in 2019 was 44 percent. The 5 and 10 year reserve
replacement ratios were 106 percent and 101 percent, respectively. Refer to Table V beginning on page 96 for a tabulation of the

Refer to the “Results of Operations” section on pages 32 through 34 for additional discussion of the company’s upstream business.
Downstream Earnings for the downstream segment are closely tied to margins on the refining, manufacturing and marketing of
products that include gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, lubricants, fuel oil, fuel and lubricant additives, and petrochemicals. Industry
margins are sometimes volatile and can be affected by the global and regional supply-and-demand balance for refined products and
petrochemicals, and by changes in the price of crude oil, other refinery and petrochemical feedstocks, and natural gas. Industry
margins can also be influenced by inventory levels, geopolitical events, costs of materials and services, refinery or chemical plant
capacity utilization, maintenance programs, and disruptions at refineries or chemical plants resulting from unplanned outages due to
severe weather, fires or other operational events.
Other factors affecting profitability for downstream operations include the reliability and efficiency of the company’s refining,
marketing and petrochemical assets, the effectiveness of its crude oil and product supply functions, and the volatility of tanker-
charter rates for the company’s shipping operations, which are driven by the industry’s demand for crude oil and product tankers.
Other factors beyond the company’s control include the general level of inflation and energy costs to operate the company’s
refining, marketing and petrochemical assets and changes in tax laws and regulations.
The company’s most significant marketing areas are the West Coast and Gulf Coast of the United States and Asia. Chevron operates
or has significant ownership interests in refineries in each of these areas.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
U.S. Upstream
Millions of dollars 2019 2018 2017
Earnings $ (5,094) $ 3,278 $ 3,640
U.S. upstream recorded a loss of $5.09 billion in 2019, compared with earnings of $3.28 billion in 2018. The decrease in earnings
was largely due to $8.17 billion in 2019 impairment charges primarily associated with Appalachia shale and Big Foot, partially
offset by the absence of 2018 write-offs and impairments of $660 million, largely due to the Tigris Project in the Gulf of Mexico.
Also contributing to the decrease was lower crude oil and natural gas prices of $1.72 billion, higher operating expenses of $260
million and the absence of several 2018 asset sale gains totaling $220 million, partially offset by higher crude oil and natural gas
production of $1.33 billion.
The company’s average realization for U.S. crude oil and natural gas liquids in 2019 was $48.54 per barrel compared with $58.17
in 2018. The average natural gas realization was $1.09 per thousand cubic feet in 2019, compared with $1.86 in 2018.
Net oil-equivalent production in 2019 averaged 929,000 barrels per day, up 17 percent from 2018. The production increase was
largely due to shale and tight properties in the Permian Basin in Texas and New Mexico.
The net liquids component of oil-equivalent production for 2019 averaged 724,000 barrels per day, up 17 percent from 2018. Net
natural gas production averaged 1.23 billion cubic feet per day in 2019, up 18 percent from 2018.
International Upstream
Millions of dollars 2019 2018 2017
Earnings* $ 7,670 $ 10,038 $ 4,510
*Includes foreign currency effects: $ (323) $ 545 $ (456)
International upstream earnings were $7.67 billion in 2019, compared with $10.04 billion in 2018. Lower crude oil and natural gas
realizations of $1.4 billion and $830 million, respectively, were partially offset by lower depreciation and tax expenses of $560
million and $280 million, respectively. There were also a number of special items that largely offset each other in 2019 and 2018.
Included in 2019 earnings were items totaling $800 million for write-offs and impairment charges of $2.2 billion associated with
Kitimat LNG and other gas projects partially offset by a gain of $1.2 billion on the sale of the U.K. Central North Sea assets and a
benefit of $180 million related to a reduction in the corporate income tax rate in Alberta, Canada. Offsetting these items were the
absence of 2018 special items of $920 million associated with impairments, write-offs, a receivable write-down and a contractual
settlement. Foreign currency effects had an unfavorable impact on earnings of $868 million between periods.
33
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The company’s average realization for international crude oil and natural gas liquids in 2019 was $58.14 per barrel compared with
$64.25 in 2018. The average natural gas realization was $5.83 per thousand cubic feet in 2019 compared with $6.29 in 2018.
International net oil-equivalent production was 2.13 million barrels per day in 2019, essentially unchanged from 2018. Production
increases from Wheatstone and major capital projects were offset by normal field declines and the impact of asset sales in 2019.
The net liquids component of international oil-equivalent production was 1.14 million barrels per day in 2019, down 2 percent from
2018. International net natural gas production of 5.93 billion cubic feet per day in 2019 increased 1 percent from 2018.
U.S. Downstream
Millions of dollars 2019 2018 2017
Earnings $ 1,559 $ 2,103 $ 2,938
U.S. downstream earned $1.56 billion in 2019, compared with $2.10 billion in 2018. The decrease was primarily due to lower
margins on refined product sales of $300 million, lower equity earnings from the 50 percent-owned CPChem of $140 million and
higher depreciation expense of $100 million following first production at the new hydrogen plant at the Richmond refinery.
Total refined product sales of 1.25 million barrels per day in 2019 were up 3 percent from 2018.
International Downstream
Millions of dollars 2019 2018 2017
Earnings* $ 922 $ 1,695 $ 2,276
*Includes foreign currency effects: $ 17 $ 71 $ (90)
International downstream earned $922 million in 2019, compared with $1.70 billion in 2018. The decrease in earnings was due to
lower margins on refined product sales of $570 million, lower gains on asset sales of $300 million, primarily due to the absence of
the 2018 gains from the southern Africa asset sale, partially offset by favorable tax items of $100 million. Foreign currency effects
had an unfavorable impact on earnings of $54 million between periods.
Total refined product sales of 1.33 million barrels per day in 2019 were down 8 percent from 2018, primarily due to the sale of the
southern Africa refining and marketing business in third quarter 2018.
All Other
Millions of dollars 2019 2018 2017
Net charges* $ (2,133) $ (2,290) $ (4,169)
*Includes foreign currency effects: $ 2 $ (5) $ 100
All Other consists of worldwide cash management and debt financing activities, corporate administrative functions, insurance
operations, real estate activities, and technology companies.
Net charges in 2019 decreased $157 million from 2018. The change between periods was mainly due to receipt of the Anadarko
merger termination fee, partially offset by higher tax items. Foreign currency effects decreased net charges by $7 million between
periods.
Consolidated Statement of Income
Comparative amounts for certain income statement categories are shown below. A discussion of variances between 2018 and 2017
can be found in the “Consolidated Statement of Income” section on pages 34 through 36 of the company’s 2018 Annual Report on
Form 10-K.
Millions of dollars 2019 2018 2017
Sales and other operating revenues $ 139,865 $ 158,902 $ 134,674
Sales and other operating revenues decreased in 2019 mainly due to lower refined product, crude oil and natural gas prices, and
lower crude oil and refined product volumes.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Millions of dollars 2019 2018 2017
Income from equity affiliates $ 3,968 $ 6,327 $ 4,438
Income from equity affiliates decreased in 2019 mainly due to lower upstream-related earnings from Tengizchevroil in Kazakhstan,
Petroboscan and Petropiar in Venezuela, and lower downstream-related earnings from GS Caltex in South Korea. In addition, two
upstream affiliates were written-down in 2019.
Refer to Note 13, beginning on page 71, for a discussion of Chevron’s investments in affiliated companies.
Millions of dollars 2019 2018 2017
Other income $ 2,683 $ 1,110 $ 2,610
Other income increased in 2019 mainly due to the receipt of the Anadarko merger termination fee and higher gains from asset sales,
partially offset by unfavorable swings in foreign currency effects.
Millions of dollars 2019 2018 2017
Purchased crude oil and products $ 80,113 $ 94,578 $ 75,765
Crude oil and product purchases decreased $14.5 billion in 2019, primarily due to lower crude oil volumes and prices, and lower
product prices and volumes.
Millions of dollars 2019 2018 2017
Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses $ 25,528 $ 24,382 $ 23,237
Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses increased $1.1 billion in 2019. The increase is mainly due to higher services
and fees, materials and supplies expense and higher transportation expense, partially offset by the absence of a 2018 receivable
write-down and contractual settlement.
Millions of dollars 2019 2018 2017
Exploration expense $ 770  $ 1,210 $ 864
Exploration expenses in 2019 decreased primarily due to lower charges for well write-offs, partially offset by higher geological and
geophysical expenses.
Millions of dollars 2019 2018 2017
Depreciation, depletion and amortization $ 29,218 $ 19,419 $ 19,349
Depreciation, depletion and amortization expenses increased in 2019 mainly due to higher impairments, production and well write-
offs, partially offset by lower rates.
Millions of dollars 2019 2018 2017
Taxes other than on income $ 4,136 $ 4,867 $ 12,331
Taxes other than on income decreased in 2019 mainly due to lower local and municipal taxes and licenses as a result of the
company’s divestment of its downstream interest in southern Africa in third quarter 2018, partially offset by higher U.S. state
carbon emissions regulatory expenses.
Millions of dollars 2019 2018 2017
Interest and debt expense $ 798  $ 748 $ 307
Interest and debt expenses increased in 2019 mainly due to lower capitalized interest, partially offset by lower interest expense
resulting from lower debt balances.
Millions of dollars 2019 2018 2017
Income tax expense (benefit) $ 2,691 $ 5,715 $ (48)
The decrease in income tax expense in 2019 of $3.02 billion is due to the decrease in total income before tax for the company of
$15.04 billion. The decrease in income before taxes for the company is primarily the result of the upstream impairment and project
write-off charges along with lower commodity prices, partially offset by higher gains on asset sales.
U.S. income before tax decreased from a profit of $4.73 billion in 2018 to a loss of $5.48 billion in 2019. This decrease in earnings
before tax was primarily driven by the effect of upstream impairments and lower crude oil and natural gas prices,
35
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
partially offset by the Anadarko merger termination fee and higher production. The U.S. tax decreased from a tax charge of $724
million in 2018 to a tax benefit of $1.17 billion in 2019 primarily due to the before-tax loss.
International income before tax decreased from $15.84 billion in 2018 to $11.02 billion in 2019. This decrease was primarily driven
by the effects of upstream project write-off and impairment charges and lower crude oil and natural gas prices, partially offset by
gains on asset sales. The lower before-tax income primarily drove the $1.13 billion decrease in international income tax expense,
from $4.99 billion in 2018 to $3.86 billion in 2019.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Sources and uses of cash
The strength of the company’s balance sheet enabled it to fund any timing differences throughout the year between cash inflows
and outflows.
Cash, Cash Equivalents, Marketable Securities and Time Deposits Total balances were $5.7 billion and $10.3 billion at
December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Cash provided by operating activities in 2019 was $27.3 billion, compared to $30.6
billion in 2018, primarily due to lower crude oil prices. Cash provided by operating activities was net of contributions to employee
pension plans of approximately $1.4 billion in 2019 and $1.0 billion in 2018. Cash provided by investing activities included
proceeds and deposits related to asset sales of $2.8 billion in 2019 and $2.0 billion in 2018.
Restricted cash of $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, was held in cash and short-term
marketable securities and recorded as “Deferred charges and other assets” and “Prepaid expenses and other current assets” on the
Consolidated Balance Sheet. These amounts are generally associated with upstream decommissioning activities, tax payments,
funds held in escrow for tax-deferred exchanges and refundable deposits related to pending asset sales.
Dividends Dividends paid to common stockholders were $9.0 billion in 2019 and $8.5 billion in 2018.
Debt and Finance Lease Liabilities Total debt and finance lease liabilities were $27.0 billion at December 31, 2019, down from
$34.5 billion at year-end 2018.
The $7.5 billion decrease in total debt and finance lease liabilities during 2019 was primarily due to the repayment of long-term
notes totaling $5.0 billion as they matured during 2019, and a reduction in commercial paper. The company’s debt and finance lease
liabilities due within one year, consisting primarily of commercial paper, redeemable long-term obligations and the current portion
of long-term debt, totaled $13.0 billion at December 31, 2019, compared with $15.6 billion at year-end 2018. Of these amounts,
$9.75 billion and $9.9 billion were reclassified to long-term debt at the end of 2019 and 2018, respectively.
At year-end 2019, settlement of these obligations was not expected to require the use of working capital in 2020, as the company
had the intent and the ability, as evidenced by committed credit facilities, to refinance them on a long-term basis.
Chevron has an automatic shelf registration statement that expires in May 2021 for an unspecified amount of nonconvertible debt
securities issued or guaranteed by the company.
The major debt rating agencies routinely evaluate the company’s debt, and the company’s cost of borrowing can increase or
decrease depending on these debt ratings. The company has outstanding public bonds issued by Chevron Corporation and Texaco
Capital Inc. All of these securities are the obligations of, or guaranteed by, Chevron Corporation and are rated AA by
38
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Standard and Poor’s Corporation and Aa2 by Moody’s Investors Service. The company’s U.S. commercial paper is rated A-1+ by
Standard and Poor’s and P-1 by Moody’s. All of these ratings denote high-quality, investment-grade securities.
The company’s future debt level is dependent primarily on results of operations, cash that may be generated from asset dispositions,
the capital program and shareholder distributions. Based on its high-quality debt ratings, the company believes that it has
substantial borrowing capacity to meet unanticipated cash requirements. During extended periods of low prices for crude oil and
natural gas and narrow margins for refined products and commodity chemicals, the company can also modify capital spending
plans and discontinue or curtail the stock repurchase program to provide flexibility to continue paying the common stock dividend
and also remain committed to retaining the company’s high-quality debt ratings.
Committed Credit Facilities Information related to committed credit facilities is included in Note 17, Short-Term Debt, on page 78.
Common Stock Repurchase Program In January 2019, the company purchased shares for $0.3 billion under the July 2010 stock
repurchase program. On February 1, 2019, the company announced that the Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase
program with a maximum dollar limit of $25 billion and no set term limits. As of December 31, 2019, the company had purchased
a total of 31.1 million shares for $3.7 billion, resulting in $21.3 billion remaining under the program authorized in February 2019.
The company currently expects to repurchase $5 billion of its common stock in 2020. Repurchases may be made from time to time
in the open market, by block purchases, in privately negotiated transactions or in such other manner as determined by the company.
The timing of the repurchases and the actual amount repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including the market price of
the company’s shares, general market and economic conditions, and other factors. The stock repurchase program does not obligate
the company to acquire any particular amount of common stock, and it may be suspended or discontinued at any time.
Capital and Exploratory Expenditures
Capital and exploratory expenditures by business segment for 2019, 2018 and 2017 are as follows:
 2019   2018 2017
Millions of dollars U.S. Int’l. Total  U.S. Int’l. Total U.S. Int’l. Total

Affiliates $10,062$ 4,820$14,882 $ 8,651$ 5,739$14,390 $ 6,295$ 7,783$14,078
Total expenditures for 2019 were $21.0 billion, including $6.1 billion for the company’s share of equity-affiliate expenditures,
which did not require cash outlays by the company. In 2018, expenditures were $20.1 billion, including the company’s share of
affiliates’ expenditures of $5.7 billion.
Of the $21.0 billion of expenditures in 2019, 85 percent, or $17.8 billion, related to upstream activities. Approximately 88 percent
was expended for upstream operations in 2018. International upstream accounted for 54 percent of the worldwide upstream
investment in 2019 and 60 percent in 2018.
The company estimates that 2020 organic capital and exploratory expenditures will be $20 billion, including $6.2 billion of
spending by affiliates. This is in line with 2019 expenditures, and reflects a robust portfolio of upstream and downstream
investments, highlighted by the company’s Permian Basin position, and additional shale and tight development in other basins.
Approximately 84 percent of the total, or $16.8 billion, is budgeted for exploration and production activities. Approximately $11
billion of planned upstream capital spending relates to base producing assets, including $4 billion for the Permian and $1 billion for
other shale and tight rock investments. Approximately $5 billion of the upstream program is planned for major capital projects
underway, including $4 billion associated with the Future Growth and Wellhead Pressure Management Project at the Tengiz field in
Kazakhstan. Global exploration funding is expected to be about $1 billion. Remaining upstream spend is budgeted for early stage
projects supporting potential future developments. The company monitors crude oil market conditions and is able to adjust future
capital outlays should oil price conditions deteriorate.
Worldwide downstream spending in 2020 is estimated to be $2.8 billion, with $1.6 billion estimated for projects in the United
States.
Investments in technology businesses and other corporate operations in 2020 are budgeted at $0.4 billion.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Noncontrolling Interests The company had noncontrolling interests of $1.0 billion at December 31, 2019 and $1.1 billion at
December 31, 2018. Distributions to noncontrolling interests totaled $18 million and $91 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Pension Obligations Information related to pension plan contributions is included beginning on page 82 in Note 21, Employee
Benefit Plans, under the heading “Cash Contributions and Benefit Payments.”
Financial Ratios and Metrics
The following represent several metrics the company believes are useful measures to monitor the financial health of the company
and its performance over time:
Current Ratio Current assets divided by current liabilities, which indicates the company’s ability to repay its short-term liabilities
with short-term assets. The current ratio in all periods was adversely affected by the fact that Chevron’s inventories are valued on a
last-in, first-out basis. At year-end 2019, the book value of inventory was lower than replacement costs, based on average
acquisition costs during the year, by approximately $4.5 billion.
 At December 31
Millions of dollars 2019 2018  2017
Current assets $ 28,329  $ 34,021  $ 28,560
Current liabilities 26,530  27,171  27,737
Current Ratio 1.1  1.3  1.0
Interest Coverage Ratio Income before income tax expense, plus interest and debt expense and amortization of capitalized interest,
less net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, divided by before-tax interest costs. This ratio indicates the company’s
ability to pay interest on outstanding debt. The company’s interest coverage ratio in 2019 was lower than 2018 due to lower
income.

Financial and Derivative Instrument Market Risk
The market risk associated with the company’s portfolio of financial and derivative instruments is discussed below. The estimates
of financial exposure to market risk do not represent the company’s projection of future market changes. The actual impact of
future market changes could differ materially due to factors discussed elsewhere in this report, including those set forth under the
heading “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A.
Derivative Commodity Instruments Chevron is exposed to market risks related to the price volatility of crude oil, refined products,
natural gas, natural gas liquids, liquefied natural gas and refinery feedstocks. The company uses derivative commodity instruments
to manage these exposures on a portion of its activity, including firm commitments and anticipated transactions for the purchase,
sale and storage of crude oil, refined products, natural gas, natural gas liquids and feedstock for company refineries. The company
also uses derivative commodity instruments for limited trading purposes. The results of these activities were not material to the
company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows in 2019.
The company’s market exposure positions are monitored on a daily basis by an internal Risk Control group in accordance with the
company’s risk management policies. The company’s risk management practices and its compliance with policies are reviewed by
the Audit Committee of the company’s Board of Directors.
Derivatives beyond those designated as normal purchase and normal sale contracts are recorded at fair value on the Consolidated
Balance Sheet with resulting gains and losses reflected in income. Fair values are derived principally from published market quotes
and other independent third-party quotes. The change in fair value of Chevron’s derivative commodity instruments in 2019 was not
material to the company’s results of operations.
The company uses the Monte Carlo simulation method as its Value-at-Risk (VaR) model to estimate the maximum potential loss in
fair value, at the 95% confidence level with a one-day holding period, from the effect of adverse changes in market
42
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
conditions on derivative commodity instruments held or issued. Based on these inputs, the VaR for the company’s primary risk
exposures in the area of derivative commodity instruments at December 31, 2019 and 2018 was not material to the company’s cash
flows or results of operations.
Foreign Currency The company may enter into foreign currency derivative contracts to manage some of its foreign currency
exposures. These exposures include revenue and anticipated purchase transactions, including foreign currency capital expenditures
and lease commitments. The foreign currency derivative contracts, if any, are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with
resulting gains and losses reflected in income. There were no open foreign currency derivative contracts at December 31, 2019.
Interest Rates The company may enter into interest rate swaps from time to time as part of its overall strategy to manage the
interest rate risk on its debt. Interest rate swaps, if any, are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with resulting gains and
losses reflected in income. At year-end 2019, the company had no interest rate swaps.
Transactions With Related Parties
Chevron enters into a number of business arrangements with related parties, principally its equity affiliates. These arrangements
include long-term supply or offtake agreements and long-term purchase agreements. Refer to “Other Information” on page 71, in
Note 13, Investments and Advances, for further discussion. Management believes these agreements have been negotiated on terms
consistent with those that would have been negotiated with an unrelated party.

“MTBE.”
Ecuador Information related to Ecuador matters is included in Note 14 under the heading “Ecuador,” beginning on page 72.

The company records asset retirement obligations when there is a legal obligation associated with the retirement of long-lived
assets and the liability can be reasonably estimated. These asset retirement obligations include costs related to environmental
issues. The liability balance of approximately $12.8 billion for asset retirement obligations at year-end 2019 related primarily to
upstream properties.
For the company’s other ongoing operating assets, such as refineries and chemicals facilities, no provisions are made for exit or
cleanup costs that may be required when such assets reach the end of their useful lives unless a decision to sell or otherwise
decommission the facility has been made, as the indeterminate settlement dates for the asset retirements prevent estimation of the
fair value of the asset retirement obligation.
Refer to the discussion below for additional information on environmental matters and their impact on Chevron, and on the
company’s 2019 environmental expenditures. Refer to Note 22 on page 87 for additional discussion of environmental remediation
provisions and year-end reserves. Refer also to Note 23 on page 89 for additional discussion of the company’s asset retirement
obligations.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Environmental Matters
The company is subject to various international, federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws, regulations and
market-based programs. These laws, regulations and programs continue to evolve and are expected to increase in both number and
complexity over time and govern not only the manner in which the company conducts its operations, but also the products it sells.
For example, international agreements and national, regional, and state legislation and regulatory measures that aim to limit or
reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are currently in various stages of implementation. Consideration of GHG issues and the
responses to those issues through international agreements and national, regional or state legislation or regulations are integrated
into the company’s strategy and planning, capital investment reviews and risk management tools and processes, where applicable.
They are also factored into the company’s long-range supply, demand and energy price forecasts. These forecasts reflect long-range
effects from renewable fuel penetration, energy efficiency standards, climate-related policy actions, and demand response to oil and
natural gas prices. In addition, legislation and regulations intended to address hydraulic fracturing also continue to evolve at the
national, state and local levels. Refer to “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A, on pages 18 through 21 for a discussion of some of the
inherent risks of increasingly restrictive environmental and other regulation that could materially impact the company’s results of
operations or financial condition.
Most of the costs of complying with existing laws and regulations pertaining to company operations and products are embedded in
the normal costs of doing business. However, it is not possible to predict with certainty the amount of additional investments in new
or existing technology or facilities or the amounts of increased operating costs to be incurred in the future to: prevent, control,
reduce or eliminate releases of hazardous materials or other pollutants into the environment; remediate and restore areas damaged
by prior releases of hazardous materials; or comply with new environmental laws or regulations. Although these costs may be
significant to the results of operations in any single period, the company does not presently expect them to have a material adverse
effect on the company’s liquidity or financial position.
Accidental leaks and spills requiring cleanup may occur in the ordinary course of business. The company may incur expenses for
corrective actions at various owned and previously owned facilities and at third-party-owned waste disposal sites used by the
company. An obligation may arise when operations are closed or sold or at non-Chevron sites where company products have been
handled or disposed of. Most of the expenditures to fulfill these obligations relate to facilities and sites where past operations
followed practices and procedures that were considered acceptable at the time but now require investigative or remedial work or
both to meet current standards.
Using definitions and guidelines established by the American Petroleum Institute, Chevron estimated its worldwide environmental
spending in 2019 at approximately $2.0 billion for its consolidated companies. Included in these expenditures were approximately
$0.6 billion of environmental capital expenditures and $1.4 billion of costs associated with the prevention, control, abatement or
elimination of hazardous substances and pollutants from operating, closed or divested sites, and the decommissioning and
restoration of sites.
For 2020, total worldwide environmental capital expenditures are estimated at $0.4 billion. These capital costs are in addition to the
ongoing costs of complying with environmental regulations and the costs to remediate previously contaminated sites.
Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions
Management makes many estimates and assumptions in the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America (GAAP) that may have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements and related
disclosures and on the comparability of such information over different reporting periods. Such estimates and assumptions affect
reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Estimates
and assumptions are based on management’s experience and other information available prior to the issuance of the financial
statements. Materially different results can occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known.
The discussion in this section of “critical” accounting estimates and assumptions is according to the disclosure guidelines of the
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), wherein:
1.the nature of the estimates and assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to
account for highly uncertain matters, or the susceptibility of such matters to change; and
2.the impact of the estimates and assumptions on the company’s financial condition or operating performance is
material.
The development and selection of accounting estimates and assumptions, including those deemed “critical,” and the associated
disclosures in this discussion have been discussed by management with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. The areas
of accounting and the associated “critical” estimates and assumptions made by the company are as follows:
44
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Oil and Gas Reserves Crude oil and natural gas reserves are estimates of future production that impact certain asset and expense
accounts included in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Proved reserves are the estimated quantities of oil and gas that
geoscience and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be economically producible in the future under existing
economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations. Proved reserves include both developed and undeveloped
volumes. Proved developed reserves represent volumes expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment
and operating methods. Proved undeveloped reserves are volumes expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled proved
acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion. Variables impacting Chevron’s
estimated volumes of crude oil and natural gas reserves include field performance, available technology, commodity prices, and
development and production costs.
The estimates of crude oil and natural gas reserves are important to the timing of expense recognition for costs incurred and to the
valuation of certain oil and gas producing assets. Impacts of oil and gas reserves on Chevron’s Consolidated Financial Statements,
using the successful efforts method of accounting, include the following:
1.Amortization - Capitalized exploratory drilling and development costs are depreciated on a unit-of-production (UOP)
basis using proved developed reserves. Acquisition costs of proved properties are amortized on a UOP basis using
total proved reserves. During 2019, Chevron’s UOP Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization (DD&A) for oil and
gas properties was $14.2 billion, and proved developed reserves at the beginning of 2019 were 6.3 billion barrels for
consolidated companies. If the estimates of proved reserves used in the UOP calculations for consolidated operations
had been lower by 5 percent across all oil and gas properties, UOP DD&A in 2019 would have increased by
approximately $700 million.
2.Impairment - Oil and gas reserves are used in assessing oil and gas producing properties for impairment. A significant
reduction in the estimated reserves of a property would trigger an impairment review. Proved reserves (and, in some
cases, a portion of unproved resources) are used to estimate future production volumes in the cash flow model. For a
further discussion of estimates and assumptions used in impairment assessments, see Impairment of Properties, Plant
and Equipment and Investments in Affiliates below.
Refer to Table V, “Reserve Quantity Information,” beginning on page 96, for the changes in proved reserve estimates for the three
years ended December 31, 2019, and to Table VII, “Changes in the Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows
From Proved Reserves” on page 103 for estimates of proved reserve values for each of the three years ended December 31, 2019.
This Oil and Gas Reserves commentary should be read in conjunction with the Properties, Plant and Equipment section of Note 1,
beginning on page 57, which includes a description of the “successful efforts” method of accounting for oil and gas exploration and
production activities.
Impairment of Properties, Plant and Equipment and Investments in Affiliates The company assesses its properties, plant and
equipment (PP&E) for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the
assets may not be recoverable. If the carrying value of an asset exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows expected from the asset,
an impairment charge is recorded for the excess of carrying value of the asset over its estimated fair value.
Determination as to whether and how much an asset is impaired involves management estimates on highly uncertain matters, such
as future commodity prices, operating expenses, production profiles, and the outlook for global or regional market supply-and-
demand conditions for crude oil, natural gas, commodity chemicals and refined products. However, the impairment reviews and
calculations are based on assumptions that are generally consistent with the company’s business plans and long-term investment
decisions. Refer also to the discussion of impairments of properties, plant and equipment in Note 16 on page 77 and to the section
on Properties, Plant and Equipment in Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” beginning on page 57.
The company routinely performs impairment reviews when triggering events arise to determine whether any write-down in the
carrying value of an asset or asset group is required. For example, when significant downward revisions to crude oil and natural gas
reserves are made for any single field or concession, an impairment review is performed to determine if the carrying value of the
asset remains recoverable. Similarly, a significant downward revision in the company’s crude oil or natural gas price outlook would
trigger impairment reviews for impacted upstream assets. In addition, impairments could occur due to changes in national, state or
local environmental regulations or laws, including those designed to stop or impede the development or production of oil and gas.
Also, if the expectation of sale of a particular asset or asset group in any period has been deemed more likely than not, an
impairment review is performed, and if the estimated net proceeds exceed the carrying value of the asset or asset group, no
impairment charge is required. Such calculations are reviewed each period until the asset or asset group is
45
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
disposed. Assets that are not impaired on a held-and-used basis could possibly become impaired if a decision is made to sell such
assets. That is, the assets would be impaired if they are classified as held-for-sale and the estimated proceeds from the sale, less
costs to sell, are less than the assets’ associated carrying values.
Investments in common stock of affiliates that are accounted for under the equity method, as well as investments in other securities
of these equity investees, are reviewed for impairment when the fair value of the investment falls below the company’s carrying
value. When this occurs, a determination must be made as to whether this loss is other-than-temporary, in which case the
investment is impaired. Because of the number of differing assumptions potentially affecting whether an investment is impaired in
any period or the amount of the impairment, a sensitivity analysis is not practicable.
In 2019, the company recorded impairments and write-offs for certain oil and gas properties following the review and approval of
its business plan and capital expenditure program. As a result of the company’s disciplined approach to capital allocation and a
downward revision in its longer-term commodity price outlook, the company will reduce funding to various natural gas-related
upstream opportunities including Appalachia shale, Kitimat LNG and other international projects. In addition, the revised long-term
oil price outlook resulted in an impairment of Big Foot. No individually material impairments of PP&E or Investments were
recorded for 2018 or 2017. A sensitivity analysis of the impact on earnings for these periods if other assumptions had been used in
impairment reviews and impairment calculations is not practicable, given the broad range of the company’s PP&E and the number
of assumptions involved in the estimates. That is, favorable changes to some assumptions might have avoided the need to impair
any assets in these periods, whereas unfavorable changes might have caused an additional unknown number of other assets to
become impaired, or resulted in larger impacts on impaired assets.
Asset Retirement Obligations In the determination of fair value for an asset retirement obligation (ARO), the company uses various
assumptions and judgments, including such factors as the existence of a legal obligation, estimated amounts and timing of
settlements, discount and inflation rates, and the expected impact of advances in technology and process improvements. A
sensitivity analysis of the ARO impact on earnings for 2019 is not practicable, given the broad range of the company’s long-lived
assets and the number of assumptions involved in the estimates. That is, favorable changes to some assumptions would have
reduced estimated future obligations, thereby lowering accretion expense and amortization costs, whereas unfavorable changes
would have the opposite effect. Refer to Note 23 on page 89 for additional discussions on asset retirement obligations.
Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans Note 21, beginning on page 82, includes information on the funded status of the
company’s pension and other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheet; the components of
pension and OPEB expense reflected on the Consolidated Statement of Income; and the related underlying assumptions.
The determination of pension plan expense and obligations is based on a number of actuarial assumptions. Two critical assumptions
are the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate applied to pension plan obligations. Critical
assumptions in determining expense and obligations for OPEB plans, which provide for certain health care and life insurance
benefits for qualifying retired employees and which are not funded, are the discount rate and the assumed health care cost-trend
rates. Information related to the company’s processes to develop these assumptions is included on page 84 in Note 21 under the
relevant headings. Actual rates may vary significantly from estimates because of unanticipated changes beyond the company’s
control.
For 2019, the company used an expected long-term rate of return of 6.75 percent and a discount rate for service costs of 4.4 percent
and a discount rate for interest cost of 3.7 percent for U.S. pension plans. The actual return for 2019 was 18.3 percent. For the 10
years ended December 31, 2019, actual asset returns averaged 8.1 percent for these plans. Additionally, with the exception of three
years within this 10-year period, actual asset returns for these plans equaled or exceeded 6.75 percent during each year.
Total pension expense for 2019 was $0.9 billion. An increase in the expected long-term return on plan assets or the discount rate
would reduce pension plan expense, and vice versa. As an indication of the sensitivity of pension expense to the long-term rate of
return assumption, a 1 percent increase in this assumption for the company’s primary U.S. pension plan, which accounted for about
59 percent of companywide pension expense, would have reduced total pension plan expense for 2019 by approximately $79
million. A 1 percent increase in the discount rates for this same plan would have reduced pension expense for 2019 by
approximately $197 million.
The aggregate funded status recognized at December 31, 2019, was a net liability of approximately $5.2 billion. An increase in the
discount rate would decrease the pension obligation, thus changing the funded status of a plan. At December 31, 2019, the company
used a discount rate of 3.1 percent to measure the obligations for the U.S. pension plans. As an indication of the
46
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
sensitivity of pension liabilities to the discount rate assumption, a 0.25 percent increase in the discount rate applied to the
company’s primary U.S. pension plan, which accounted for about 62 percent of the companywide pension obligation, would have
reduced the plan obligation by approximately $401 million, and would have decreased the plan’s underfunded status from
approximately $2.5 billion to $2.1 billion.
For the company’s OPEB plans, expense for 2019 was $101 million, and the total liability, all unfunded at the end of 2019, was
$2.5 billion. For the main U.S. OPEB plan, the company used a discount rate for service cost of 4.5 percent and a discount rate for
interest cost of 3.9 percent to measure expense in 2019, and a 3.1 percent discount rate to measure the benefit obligations at
December 31, 2019. Discount rate changes, similar to those used in the pension sensitivity analysis, resulted in an immaterial
impact on 2019 OPEB expense and OPEB liabilities at the end of 2019. For information on the sensitivity of the health care cost-
trend rate, refer to page 84 in Note 21 under the heading “Other Benefit Assumptions.”
Differences between the various assumptions used to determine expense and the funded status of each plan and actual experience
are included in actuarial gain/loss. Refer to page 83 in Note 21 for a description of the method used to amortize the $6.5 billion of
before-tax actuarial losses recorded by the company as of December 31, 2019, and an estimate of the costs to be recognized in
expense during 2020. In addition, information related to company contributions is included on page 86 in Note 21 under the
heading “Cash Contributions and Benefit Payments.”
Contingent Losses Management also makes judgments and estimates in recording liabilities for claims, litigation, tax matters and
environmental remediation. Actual costs can frequently vary from estimates for a variety of reasons. For example, the costs for
settlement of claims and litigation can vary from estimates based on differing interpretations of laws, opinions on culpability and
assessments on the amount of damages. Similarly, liabilities for environmental remediation are subject to change because of
changes in laws, regulations and their interpretation, the determination of additional information on the extent and nature of site
contamination, and improvements in technology.
Under the accounting rules, a liability is generally recorded for these types of contingencies if management determines the loss to
be both probable and estimable. The company generally reports these losses as “Operating expenses” or “Selling, general and
administrative expenses” on the Consolidated Statement of Income. An exception to this handling is for income tax matters, for
which benefits are recognized only if management determines the tax position is “more likely than not” (i.e., likelihood greater than
50 percent) to be allowed by the tax jurisdiction. For additional discussion of income tax uncertainties, refer to Note 22 beginning
on page 87. Refer also to the business segment discussions elsewhere in this section for the effect on earnings from losses
associated with certain litigation, environmental remediation and tax matters for the three years ended December 31, 2019.
An estimate as to the sensitivity to earnings for these periods if other assumptions had been used in recording these liabilities is not

 Management’s Responsibility for Financial Statements
 To the Stockholders of Chevron Corporation
Management of Chevron Corporation is responsible for preparing the accompanying consolidated financial statements and the
related information appearing in this report. The statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America and fairly represent the transactions and financial position of the company. The
financial statements include amounts that are based on management’s best estimates and judgments.
As stated in its report included herein, the independent registered public accounting firm of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has
audited the company’s consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States).
The Board of Directors of Chevron has an Audit Committee composed of directors who are not officers or employees of the
company. The Audit Committee meets regularly with members of management, the internal auditors and the independent
registered public accounting firm to review accounting, internal control, auditing and financial reporting matters. Both the
internal auditors and the independent registered public accounting firm have free and direct access to the Audit Committee
without the presence of management.
The company’s management has evaluated, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
the effectiveness of the company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in the Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and
15d-15(e)) as of December 31, 2019. Based on that evaluation, management concluded that the company’s disclosure controls
are effective in ensuring that information required to be recorded, processed, summarized and reported, are done within the
time periods specified in the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms.
 Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
 The company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting,
as defined in the Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). The company’s management, including the Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over
financial reporting based on the Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on the results of this evaluation, the company’s management

 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
 To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Chevron Corporation:
 Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Chevron Corporation and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as
of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the related consolidated statements of income, of comprehensive income, of equity and of
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019, including the related notes and financial
statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial
statements”). We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on
criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
the Treadway Commission (COSO).
 In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of the Company as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 2019 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)
issued by the COSO.
 Basis for Opinions
The Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included
in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express
opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting
based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities
laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement,
whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects.
Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement
of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.
Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated
financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control
over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a
material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the
assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures
that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the
company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or
disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

 Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial
statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or
disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or
complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated
financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate
opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
 The Impact of Crude Oil and Natural Gas Reserves and Other Factors on Upstream Property, Plant, and Equipment, Net
As described in Notes 1 and 16 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s upstream property, plant and
equipment, net balance was $133.7 billion as of December 31, 2019, and related depreciation, depletion and amortization
expense was $27.8 billion, including impairments of $10.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019.  Management uses the
successful efforts method for crude oil and natural gas exploration and production activities. Depreciation and depletion of all
capitalized costs of proved crude oil and natural gas producing properties, except mineral interests, are expensed using the unit-
of-production method, generally by individual field, as the proved developed reserves are produced. Depletion expenses for
capitalized costs of proved mineral interests are recognized using the unit-of-production method by individual field as the
related proved reserves are produced. Upstream property, plant, and equipment to be held and used, including proved crude oil
and natural gas properties, are assessed for possible impairment by comparing their carrying values with their associated
undiscounted, future net cash flows. Impaired assets are written down to their estimated fair values, generally their discounted,
future net cash flows. As disclosed by management, determination as to whether and how much an asset is impaired involves
management estimates on uncertain matters, such as future commodity prices, operating expenses, production profiles, and the
outlook for global or regional market supply-and-demand conditions for crude oil, natural gas, commodity chemicals and
refined products. Variables impacting Chevron’s estimated volumes of crude oil and natural gas reserves include field
performance, available technology, commodity prices, and development and production costs. Reserves are estimated by
Company asset teams composed of earth scientists and engineers. As part of the internal control process related to reserves
estimation, the Company maintains a Reserves Advisory Committee (RAC) (the RAC is referred to as “management’s
specialists”). 
The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the impact of crude oil and natural gas
reserves and other factors on upstream property, plant, and equipment, net is a critical audit matter are there was significant
judgment by management, including the use of management’s specialists, when developing the estimates of proved crude oil
and natural gas reserves and assessing upstream property, plant, and equipment to be held and used for impairment. This in turn
led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence
obtained related to the significant assumptions used by management, including future commodity prices, production profiles,
development costs, and operating expenses. 
Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall
opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to
management’s calculation of upstream depreciation, depletion and amortization expense, assessment of upstream property,
plant, and equipment to be held and used for impairment, and estimates of proved crude oil and natural gas reserves. These
procedures also included, among others, (i) testing the unit-of-production rates used to calculate depreciation, depletion and
amortization expense, (ii) testing the completeness, accuracy, and relevance of underlying data used in management’s estimates,
and (iii) evaluating the significant assumptions used by management in developing these estimates, including future commodity
prices, production profiles, development costs and operating expenses. Evaluating the significant assumptions relating to the
estimates of crude oil and natural gas reserves also involved obtaining evidence to support the reasonableness of the
assumptions, including whether the assumptions used were reasonable considering the past performance of the company, and
whether they were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. The work of management’s specialists was used
in performing the procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of these estimates of proved crude oil and natural gas reserves. As a
basis for using this work, the specialists’ qualifications and objectivity were understood, as well as the methods and assumptions
used by the specialists. The procedures performed also included tests of the data used by the specialists and an evaluation of the
specialists’ findings.

Note 1
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
General The company’s Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. These require the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the assets, liabilities,
revenues and expenses reported in the financial statements, as well as amounts included in the notes thereto, including discussion
and disclosure of contingent liabilities. Although the company uses its best estimates and judgments, actual results could differ
from these estimates as circumstances change and additional information becomes known.
Subsidiary and Affiliated Companies The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of controlled subsidiary
companies more than 50 percent-owned and any variable-interest entities in which the company is the primary beneficiary.
Undivided interests in oil and gas joint ventures and certain other assets are consolidated on a proportionate basis. Investments in
and advances to affiliates in which the company has a substantial ownership interest of approximately 20 percent to 50 percent, or
for which the company exercises significant influence but not control over policy decisions, are accounted for by the equity
method.
Investments in affiliates are assessed for possible impairment when events indicate that the fair value of the investment may be
below the company’s carrying value. When such a condition is deemed to be other than temporary, the carrying value of the
investment is written down to its fair value, and the amount of the write-down is included in net income. In making the
determination as to whether a decline is other than temporary, the company considers such factors as the duration and extent of the
decline, the investee’s financial performance, and the company’s ability and intention to retain its investment for a period that will
be sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the investment’s market value. The new cost basis of investments in these
equity investees is not changed for subsequent recoveries in fair value.
Differences between the company’s carrying value of an equity investment and its underlying equity in the net assets of the affiliate
are assigned to the extent practicable to specific assets and liabilities based on the company’s analysis of the various factors giving
rise to the difference. When appropriate, the company’s share of the affiliate’s reported earnings is adjusted quarterly to reflect the
difference between these allocated values and the affiliate’s historical book values.
Noncontrolling Interests Ownership interests in the company’s subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent are presented
separately from the parent’s equity on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The amount of consolidated net income attributable to the
parent and the noncontrolling interests are both presented on the face of the Consolidated Statement of Income and Consolidated
Statement of Equity.
Fair Value Measurements The three levels of the fair value hierarchy of inputs the company uses to measure the fair value of an
asset or a liability are as follows. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs
are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability. Level
3 inputs are inputs that are not observable in the market.
Derivatives The majority of the company’s activity in derivative commodity instruments is intended to manage the financial risk
posed by physical transactions. For some of this derivative activity, generally limited to large, discrete or infrequently occurring
transactions, the company may elect to apply fair value or cash flow hedge accounting. For other similar derivative instruments,
generally because of the short-term nature of the contracts or their limited use, the company does not apply hedge accounting, and
changes in the fair value of those contracts are reflected in current income. For the company’s commodity trading activity, gains
and losses from derivative instruments are reported in current income. The company may enter into interest rate swaps from time to
time as part of its overall strategy to manage the interest rate risk on its debt. Interest rate swaps related to a portion of the
company’s fixed-rate debt, if any, may be accounted for as fair value hedges. Interest rate swaps related to floating-rate debt, if any,
are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with resulting gains and losses reflected in income. Where Chevron is a party to
master netting arrangements, fair value receivable and payable amounts recognized for derivative instruments executed with the
same counterparty are generally offset on the balance sheet.
Inventories Crude oil, petroleum products and chemicals inventories are generally stated at cost, using a last-in, first-out method. In
the aggregate, these costs are below market. “Materials, supplies and other” inventories are primarily stated at cost or net realizable
value.
Properties, Plant and Equipment The successful efforts method is used for crude oil and natural gas exploration and production
activities. All costs for development wells, related plant and equipment, proved mineral interests in crude oil and natural gas
properties, and related asset retirement obligation (ARO) assets are capitalized. Costs of exploratory wells are capitalized pending
determination of whether the wells found proved reserves. Costs of wells that are assigned proved
57
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts
reserves remain capitalized. Costs also are capitalized for exploratory wells that have found crude oil and natural gas reserves even
if the reserves cannot be classified as proved when the drilling is completed, provided the exploratory well has found a sufficient
quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a producing well and the company is making sufficient progress assessing the
reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project. All other exploratory wells and costs are expensed. Refer to Note
19, beginning on page 79, for additional discussion of accounting for suspended exploratory well costs.
Long-lived assets to be held and used, including proved crude oil and natural gas properties, are assessed for possible impairment
by comparing their carrying values with their associated undiscounted, future net cash flows. Events that can trigger assessments
for possible impairments include write-downs of proved reserves based on field performance, significant decreases in the market
value of an asset (including changes to the commodity price forecast), significant change in the extent or manner of use of or a
physical change in an asset, and a more-likely-than-not expectation that a long-lived asset or asset group will be sold or otherwise
disposed of significantly sooner than the end of its previously estimated useful life. Impaired assets are written down to their
estimated fair values, generally their discounted, future net cash flows. For proved crude oil and natural gas properties, the
company performs impairment reviews on a country, concession, PSC, development area or field basis, as appropriate. In
Downstream, impairment reviews are performed on the basis of a refinery, a plant, a marketing/lubricants area or distribution area,
as appropriate. Impairment amounts are recorded as incremental “Depreciation, depletion and amortization” expense.
Long-lived assets that are held for sale are evaluated for possible impairment by comparing the carrying value of the asset with its
fair value less the cost to sell. If the net book value exceeds the fair value less cost to sell, the asset is considered impaired and
adjusted to the lower value. Refer to Note 7, beginning on page 65, relating to fair value measurements. The fair value of a liability
for an ARO is recorded as an asset and a liability when there is a legal obligation associated with the retirement of a long-lived
asset and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Refer also to Note 23, on page 89, relating to AROs.
Depreciation and depletion of all capitalized costs of proved crude oil and natural gas producing properties, except mineral
interests, are expensed using the unit-of-production method, generally by individual field, as the proved developed reserves are
produced. Depletion expenses for capitalized costs of proved mineral interests are recognized using the unit-of-production method
by individual field as the related proved reserves are produced. Impairments of capitalized costs of unproved mineral interests are
expensed.
The capitalized costs of all other plant and equipment are depreciated or amortized over their estimated useful lives. In general, the
declining-balance method is used to depreciate plant and equipment in the United States; the straight-line method is generally used
to depreciate international plant and equipment and to amortize finance lease right-of-use assets.
Gains or losses are not recognized for normal retirements of properties, plant and equipment subject to composite group
amortization or depreciation. Gains or losses from abnormal retirements are recorded as expenses, and from sales as “Other
income.”
Expenditures for maintenance (including those for planned major maintenance projects), repairs and minor renewals to maintain
facilities in operating condition are generally expensed as incurred. Major replacements and renewals are capitalized.
Goodwill Goodwill resulting from a business combination is not subject to amortization. The company tests such goodwill at the
reporting unit level for impairment annually at December 31, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that
would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount.
Environmental Expenditures Environmental expenditures that relate to ongoing operations or to conditions caused by past
operations are expensed. Expenditures that create future benefits or contribute to future revenue generation are capitalized.
Liabilities related to future remediation costs are recorded when environmental assessments or cleanups or both are probable and
the costs can be reasonably estimated. For crude oil, natural gas and mineral-producing properties, a liability for an ARO is made in
accordance with accounting standards for asset retirement and environmental obligations. Refer to Note 23, on page 89, for a
discussion of the company’s AROs.
For federal Superfund sites and analogous sites under state laws, the company records a liability for its designated share of the
probable and estimable costs, and probable amounts for other potentially responsible parties when mandated by the regulatory
agencies because the other parties are not able to pay their respective shares. The gross amount of environmental liabilities is based
on the company’s best estimate of future costs using currently available technology and applying current
58
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts
regulations and the company’s own internal environmental policies. Future amounts are not discounted. Recoveries or
reimbursements are recorded as assets when receipt is reasonably assured.
Currency Translation The U.S. dollar is the functional currency for substantially all of the company’s consolidated operations and
those of its equity affiliates. For those operations, all gains and losses from currency remeasurement are included in current period
income. The cumulative translation effects for those few entities, both consolidated and affiliated, using functional currencies other
than the U.S. dollar are included in “Currency translation adjustment” on the Consolidated Statement of Equity.
Revenue Recognition The company accounts for each delivery order of crude oil, natural gas, petroleum and chemical products as
a separate performance obligation. Revenue is recognized when the performance obligation is satisfied, which typically occurs at
the point in time when control of the product transfers to the customer. Payment is generally due within 30 days of delivery. The
company accounts for delivery transportation as a fulfillment cost, not a separate performance obligation, and recognizes these
costs as an operating expense in the period when revenue for the related commodity is recognized.
Revenue is measured as the amount the company expects to receive in exchange for transferring commodities to the customer. The
company’s commodity sales are typically based on prevailing market-based prices and may include discounts and allowances. Until
market prices become known under terms of the company’s contracts, the transaction price included in revenue is based on the
company’s estimate of the most likely outcome.
Discounts and allowances are estimated using a combination of historical and recent data trends. When deliveries contain multiple
products, an observable standalone selling price is generally used to measure revenue for each product. The company includes
estimates in the transaction price only to the extent that a significant reversal of revenue is not probable in subsequent periods.
Excise, value-added and similar taxes assessed by a governmental authority on a revenue-producing transaction between a seller
and a customer are presented on a net basis in “Taxes other than on income” on the Consolidated Statement of Income, on page 52.
Purchases and sales of inventory with the same counterparty that are entered into in contemplation of one another (including
buy/sell arrangements) are combined and recorded on a net basis and reported in “Purchased crude oil and products” on the
Consolidated Statement of Income.
Prior to the adoption of ASC 606 on January 1, 2018, revenues associated with sales of crude oil, natural gas, petroleum and
chemicals products, and all other sources were recorded when title passed to the customer, net of royalties, discounts and
allowances, as applicable. Revenues from natural gas production from properties in which Chevron has an interest with other
producers were generally recognized using the entitlement method. Excise, value-added and similar taxes assessed by a
governmental authority on a revenue-producing transaction between a seller and a customer were presented on a gross basis on the
Consolidated Statement of Income.
Stock Options and Other Share-Based Compensation The company issues stock options and other share-based compensation to
certain employees. For equity awards, such as stock options, total compensation cost is based on the grant date fair value, and for
liability awards, such as stock appreciation rights, total compensation cost is based on the settlement value. The company
recognizes stock-based compensation expense for all awards over the service period required to earn the award, which is the shorter
of the vesting period or the time period in which an employee becomes eligible to retain the award at retirement. The company’s
Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) awards include stock options and stock appreciation rights, which have graded vesting provisions
by which one-third of each award vests on each of the first, second and third anniversaries of the date of grant. In addition,
performance shares granted under the company’s LTIP will vest at the end of the three-year performance period. For awards
granted under the company’s LTIP beginning in 2017, stock options and stock appreciation rights have graded vesting by which one
third of each award vests annually on each January 31 on or after the first anniversary of the grant date. Standard restricted stock
unit awards have cliff vesting by which the total award will vest on January 31 on or after the fifth anniversary of the grant date,
subject to adjustment upon termination pursuant to the satisfaction of certain criteria. The company amortizes these awards on a
straight-line basis.

New Accounting Standards
Leases (Topic 842) Effective January 1, 2019, Chevron adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-02 and its related
amendments. For additional information on the company’s leases, refer to Note 5 beginning on page 62.
Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326) In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, which becomes effective for the
company beginning January 1, 2020. The standard requires companies to use forward-looking information to calculate credit loss
estimates.  The company completed the accounting policy and work process changes necessary to meet the standard’s requirements.
The company does not expect the implementation of the standard to have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements.
Note 5
Lease Commitments
Chevron implemented the new lease standard at the effective date of January 1, 2019. The cumulative-effect adjustment to the
opening balance of 2019 retained earnings is de minimis. The company elected the option to apply the transition provisions at the
adoption date instead of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. By making this election, the company
has not applied retrospective reporting for the comparable periods. The company elected the short-term lease exception provided
for in the standard and therefore only recognizes right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for leases with a term greater than one year.
The company elected the package of practical expedients to not re-evaluate existing contracts as containing a lease or the lease
classification unless it was not previously assessed against the lease criteria. In addition, the company did not reassess initial direct
costs for any existing leases. The company applied the land easement practical expedient. The company has elected the practical
expedient to not separate non-lease components from lease components for most asset classes except for certain asset classes that
have significant non-lease (i.e., service) components. The company assessed some contracts, including those for drill ships, drilling
rigs, and storage tanks, not previously assessed against the lease criteria, as operating leases under the new standard, increasing the
lease commitments by approximately $2 billion.
The company enters into leasing arrangements as a lessee; any lessor arrangements are not significant. Leases are classified as
operating or finance leases. Both operating and finance leases recognize lease liabilities and associated right-of-use assets.
Operating lease arrangements mainly involve drill ships, drilling rigs, time chartered vessels, bareboat charters, terminals,
62
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

exploration and production equipment, office buildings and warehouses, and land. Finance leases primarily include facilities and
vessels.
Chevron uses various assumptions and judgments in preparing the quantitative data and qualitative information that is material to
the company’s overall lease population. Where leases are used in joint ventures, the company recognizes 100% of the right-of-use
assets and lease liabilities when the company is the sole signatory for the lease (in most cases, where the company is the operator of
a joint venture). Lease costs reflect only the costs associated with the operator’s working interest share. The lease term includes the
committed lease term identified in the contract, taking into account renewal and termination options that management is reasonably
certain to exercise. The company uses its incremental borrowing rate as a proxy for the discount rate based on the term of the lease
unless the implicit rate is available.
Details of the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for operating and finance leases, including the balance sheet presentation, are

Fair Value Measurements
The tables on the next page show the fair value hierarchy for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring and
nonrecurring basis at December 31, 2019, and December 31, 2018.
Marketable Securities The company calculates fair value for its marketable securities based on quoted market prices for identical
assets. The fair values reflect the cash that would have been received if the instruments were sold at December 31, 2019.
Derivatives The company records its derivative instruments – other than any commodity derivative contracts that are designated as
normal purchase and normal sale – on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value, with the offsetting amount to the Consolidated
Statement of Income. Derivatives classified as Level 1 include futures, swaps and options contracts traded in active markets such as
the New York Mercantile Exchange. Derivatives classified as Level 2 include swaps, options and forward contracts principally with
financial institutions and other oil and gas companies, the fair values of which are obtained from third-party broker quotes, industry
pricing services and exchanges. The company obtains multiple sources of pricing information for the Level 2 instruments. Since
this pricing information is generated from observable market data, it has historically been very consistent. The company does not
materially adjust this information.
Properties, Plant and Equipment The company reported impairments for certain upstream properties during 2019 primarily due to
capital allocation decisions and a lower long-term commodity price outlook. The company did not have any individually material
impairments in 2018.
Investments and Advances The company reported impairments for certain upstream equity companies during 2019 primarily due
to capital allocation decisions and a lower long-term commodity price outlook. The company did not have any individually material
impairments of investments and advances in 2018.

Assets and Liabilities Not Required to Be Measured at Fair Value The company holds cash equivalents and time deposits in U.S.
and non-U.S. portfolios. The instruments classified as cash equivalents are primarily bank time deposits with maturities of 90 days
or less and money market funds. “Cash and cash equivalents” had carrying/fair values of $5,686 and $9,342 at
65
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts
December 31, 2019, and December 31, 2018, respectively. The instruments held in “Time deposits” are bank time deposits with
maturities greater than 90 days and had carrying/fair values of zero and $950 at December 31, 2019, and December 31, 2018,
respectively. The fair values of cash, cash equivalents and bank time deposits are classified as Level 1 and reflect the cash that
would have been received if the instruments were settled at December 31, 2019.
“Cash and cash equivalents” do not include investments with a carrying/fair value of $1,225 and $1,139 at December 31, 2019, and
December 31, 2018, respectively. At December 31, 2019, these investments are classified as Level 1 and include restricted funds
related to certain upstream decommissioning activities, refundable deposits held in escrow related to pending asset sales, tax
payments and a financing program, which are reported in “Deferred charges and other assets” on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Long-term debt, excluding finance lease liabilities, of $13,659 and $18,706 at December 31, 2019, and December 31, 2018,
respectively, had estimated fair values of $14,326 and $18,729, respectively. Long-term debt primarily includes corporate issued
bonds. The fair value of corporate bonds is $13,460 and classified as Level 1. The fair value of other long-term debt is $866 and
classified as Level 2.
The carrying values of short-term financial assets and liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet approximate their fair values.
Fair value remeasurements of other financial instruments at December 31, 2019 and 2018, were not material.
Note 8
Financial and Derivative Instruments
Derivative Commodity Instruments The company’s derivative commodity instruments principally include crude oil, natural gas
and refined product futures, swaps, options, and forward contracts. None of the company’s derivative instruments is designated as a
hedging instrument, although certain of the company’s affiliates make such designation. The company’s derivatives are not material
to the company’s financial position, results of operations or liquidity. The company believes it has no material market or credit risks
to its operations, financial position or liquidity as a result of its commodity derivative activities.
The company uses derivative commodity instruments traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange and on electronic platforms of
the Inter-Continental Exchange and Chicago Mercantile Exchange. In addition, the company enters into swap contracts and option
contracts principally with major financial institutions and other oil and gas companies in the “over-the-counter” markets, which are
governed by International Swaps and Derivatives Association agreements and other master netting arrangements. Depending on the
nature of the derivative transactions, bilateral collateral arrangements may also be required.
Derivative instruments measured at fair value at December 31, 2019, December 31, 2018, and December 31, 2017, and their
classification on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and Consolidated Statement of Income are below:

Derivative assets and liabilities are classified on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as accounts and notes receivable, long-term
receivables, accounts payable, and deferred credits and other noncurrent obligations. Amounts not offset on the Consolidated
Balance Sheet represent positions that do not meet all the conditions for “a right of offset.”  
Concentrations of Credit Risk The company’s financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist
primarily of its cash equivalents, time deposits, marketable securities, derivative financial instruments and trade receivables. The
company’s short-term investments are placed with a wide array of financial institutions with high credit ratings. Company
investment policies limit the company’s exposure both to credit risk and to concentrations of credit risk. Similar policies on
diversification and creditworthiness are applied to the company’s counterparties in derivative instruments.
The trade receivable balances, reflecting the company’s diversified sources of revenue, are dispersed among the company’s broad
customer base worldwide. As a result, the company believes concentrations of credit risk are limited. The company routinely
assesses the financial strength of its customers. When the financial strength of a customer is not considered sufficient, alternative
risk mitigation measures may be deployed, including requiring pre-payments, letters of credit or other acceptable collateral
instruments to support sales to customers.
Note 9
Assets Held for Sale
At December 31, 2019, the company classified $3,411 of net properties, plant and equipment as “Assets held for sale” on the
Consolidated Balance Sheet. These assets are associated with upstream operations that are anticipated to be sold in the next 12
months. The revenues and earnings contributions of these assets in 2019 were not material.
Note 10
Equity
Retained earnings at December 31, 2019 and 2018, included $25,319 and $22,362, respectively, for the company’s share of
undistributed earnings of equity affiliates.
At December 31, 2019, about 72 million shares of Chevron’s common stock remained available for issuance from the 260 million
shares that were reserved for issuance under the Chevron Long-Term Incentive Plan. In addition, 688,303 shares remain available
for issuance from the 1,600,000 shares of the company’s common stock that were reserved for awards under the Chevron
Corporation Non-Employee Directors’ Equity Compensation and Deferral Plan.
Note 11
Earnings Per Share
Basic earnings per share (EPS) is based upon “Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Chevron Corporation” (“earnings”) and includes
the effects of deferrals of salary and other compensation awards that are invested in Chevron stock units by certain officers and
employees of the company. Diluted EPS includes the effects of these items as well as the dilutive effects of outstanding stock
options awarded under the company’s stock option programs (refer to Note 20, “Stock Options and Other Share-Based
Compensation,” beginning on page 80). The table on the following page sets forth the computation of basic and diluted EPS:

Operating Segments and Geographic Data
Although each subsidiary of Chevron is responsible for its own affairs, Chevron Corporation manages its investments in these
subsidiaries and their affiliates. The investments are grouped into two business segments, Upstream and Downstream, representing
the company’s “reportable segments” and “operating segments.” Upstream operations consist primarily of exploring for,
developing and producing crude oil and natural gas; liquefaction, transportation and regasification associated with liquefied natural
gas (LNG); transporting crude oil by major international oil export pipelines; processing, transporting, storage and marketing of
natural gas; and a gas-to-liquids plant. Downstream operations consist primarily of refining of crude oil into petroleum products;
marketing of crude oil and refined products; transporting of crude oil and refined products by pipeline, marine vessel, motor
equipment and rail car; and manufacturing and marketing of commodity petrochemicals, plastics for industrial uses, and fuel and
lubricant additives. All Other activities of the company include worldwide cash management and debt financing activities,
corporate administrative functions, insurance operations, real estate activities, and technology activities.
The company’s segments are managed by “segment managers” who report to the “chief operating decision maker” (CODM). The
segments represent components of the company that engage in activities (a) from which revenues are earned and expenses are
incurred; (b) whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the CODM, which makes decisions about resources to be allocated
to the segments and assesses their performance; and (c) for which discrete financial information is available.
The company’s primary country of operation is the United States of America, its country of domicile. Other components of the
company’s operations are reported as “International” (outside the United States).

Segment Earnings The company evaluates the performance of its operating segments on an after-tax basis, without considering the
effects of debt financing interest expense or investment interest income, both of which are managed by the company on a
worldwide basis. Corporate administrative costs are not allocated to the operating segments. However, operating segments are
billed for the direct use of corporate services. Nonbillable costs remain at the corporate level in “All Other.” Earnings by major
operating area are presented in the following table:

for the years 2019, 2018 and 2017, are presented in the table on the next page. Products are transferred between operating segments
at internal product values that approximate market prices.
Revenues for the upstream segment are derived primarily from the production and sale of crude oil and natural gas, as well as the
sale of third-party production of natural gas. Revenues for the downstream segment are derived from the refining and marketing of
petroleum products such as gasoline, jet fuel, gas oils, lubricants, residual fuel oils and other products derived from crude oil. This
segment also generates revenues from the manufacture and sale of fuel and lubricant additives and the transportation and trading of
refined products and crude oil. “All Other” activities include revenues from insurance operations, real estate activities and
technology companies.

Descriptions of major affiliates, including significant differences between the company’s carrying value of its investments and its
underlying equity in the net assets of the affiliates, are as follows:
Tengizchevroil Chevron has a 50 percent equity ownership interest in Tengizchevroil (TCO), which operates the Tengiz and
Korolev crude oil fields in Kazakhstan. At December 31, 2019, the company’s carrying value of its investment in TCO was about
$110 higher than the amount of underlying equity in TCO’s net assets. This difference results from Chevron acquiring a portion of
its interest in TCO at a value greater than the underlying book value for that portion of TCO’s net assets. Included in the investment
is a loan to TCO to fund the development of the Future Growth and Wellhead Pressure Management Project with a balance of
$3,350.
Petropiar Chevron has a 30 percent interest in Petropiar, a joint stock company which operates the heavy oil Huyapari Field and
upgrading project in Venezuela’s Orinoco Belt. At December 31, 2019, the company’s carrying value of its investment in Petropiar
was approximately $130 less than the amount of underlying equity in Petropiar’s net assets. The difference represents the excess of
Chevron’s underlying equity in Petropiar’s net assets over the net book value of the assets contributed to the venture.
Petroboscan Chevron has a 39.2 percent interest in Petroboscan, a joint stock company which operates the Boscan Field in
Venezuela. At December 31, 2019, the company’s carrying value of its investment in Petroboscan was approximately $90 higher
than the amount of underlying equity in Petroboscan’s net assets. The difference reflects the excess of the net book value of the
assets contributed by Chevron over its underlying equity in Petroboscan’s net assets. The company also has an outstanding long-
term loan to Petroboscan of $566 at year-end 2019.
Caspian Pipeline Consortium Chevron has a 15 percent interest in the Caspian Pipeline Consortium, a variable interest entity,
which provides the critical export route for crude oil from both TCO and Karachaganak. The company has investments and
advances totaling $883, which includes long-term loans of $199 at year-end 2019. The loans were provided to fund 30 percent of
the initial pipeline construction. The company is not the primary beneficiary of the consortium because it does not direct activities
of the consortium and only receives its proportionate share of the financial returns.

Angola LNG Limited Chevron has a 36.4 percent interest in Angola LNG Limited, which processes and liquefies natural gas
produced in Angola for delivery to international markets.
Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC Chevron owns 50 percent of Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC. The other half

Litigation
MTBE Chevron and many other companies in the petroleum industry have used methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) as a gasoline
additive. Chevron is a party to six pending lawsuits and claims, the majority of which involve numerous other petroleum marketers
and refiners. Resolution of these lawsuits and claims may ultimately require the company to correct or ameliorate the alleged
effects on the environment of prior release of MTBE by the company or other parties. Additional lawsuits and claims related to the
use of MTBE, including personal-injury claims, may be filed in the future. The company’s ultimate exposure related to pending
lawsuits and claims is not determinable. The company no longer uses MTBE in the manufacture of gasoline in the United States.
Ecuador
Background Chevron is a defendant in civil litigation proceedings stemming from a lawsuit filed in the Superior Court for the
province of Nueva Loja in Lago Agrio, Ecuador in May 2003 by plaintiffs who claim to be representatives of residents of an area
where an oil production consortium formerly operated. The lawsuit alleged harm to the environment from the consortium’s oil
production activities and sought monetary damages and other relief. Texaco Petroleum Company (Texpet), a subsidiary of Texaco
Inc., was a minority member of the consortium from 1967 until 1992, with state-owned Petroecuador as the majority partner. Since
1992, Petroecuador has been the sole owner and operator in the concession area. After the termination of the consortium and
following an independent third-party environmental audit of the concession area, in 1995, Texpet entered into a formal agreement
with the Republic of Ecuador and Petroecuador under which Texpet agreed to remediate specific sites assigned by the government
in proportion to Texpet’s minority share of the consortium. Pursuant to that agreement, Texpet conducted a three-year remediation
program. After certifying that the assigned sites were properly remediated, in 1998, Ecuador granted Texpet and all related
corporate entities a full release from any and all environmental liability arising from the consortium operations.
Chevron defended itself in the Lago Agrio lawsuit on the grounds that the claims lacked both legal and factual merit. As to matters
of law, Chevron asserted that the court lacked jurisdiction, the plaintiffs sought to improperly apply a 1999 law
72
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts
retroactively, the claims were time-barred, and the lawsuit was barred by releases signed by the Republic of Ecuador, Petroecuador,
and the pertinent provincial and municipal governments. With regard to the facts, the company asserted that the evidence confirmed
Texpet’s remediation was properly conducted and that any remaining environmental impacts reflected Petroecuador’s failure to
timely fulfill its own legal obligation to remediate the concession area and Petroecuador’s conduct after it assumed control over
operations. In February 2011, the provincial court rendered a judgment against Chevron, awarding approximately $8,600 in
damages, plus approximately $900 for the plaintiffs’ representatives, and approximately $8,600 in additional punitive damages
unless the company issued a public apology within 15 days, which Chevron did not do. In January 2012 an appellate panel affirmed
the judgment and ordered that Chevron pay an additional 0.10% in attorneys’ fees. In November 2013, Ecuador’s National Court of
Justice ratified the judgment but nullified the $8,600 punitive damage assessment, resulting in a judgment of $9,500. In December
2013, Chevron appealed the decision to Ecuador’s highest Constitutional Court, which rejected Chevron’s appeal in July 2018. No
further appeals are available in Ecuador.
The Lago Agrio plaintiffs’ lawyers have sought to enforce the judgment in Ecuador and other jurisdictions. In May 2012, they filed
a recognition and enforcement action against Chevron Corporation, Chevron Canada Limited and another subsidiary (which was
later dismissed as a party) in the Superior Court of Justice in Ontario, Canada. In September 2015, the Supreme Court of Canada
ruled that the Ontario Superior Court of Justice had jurisdiction over Chevron Corporation and Chevron Canada Limited for
purposes of the action. In January 2017, the Superior Court ruled that Chevron Canada Limited and Chevron Corporation are
separate legal entities with separate rights and obligations, and dismissed the action against Chevron Canada Limited. In May 2018,
the Court of Appeal for Ontario upheld the dismissal of Chevron Canada Limited. The Supreme Court of Canada denied the
plaintiffs’ application for leave to appeal in April 2019, rendering the dismissal of Chevron Canada Limited final. In July 2019, by
consent of the parties, the Ontario Superior Court dismissed the recognition and enforcement action against Chevron Corporation
with prejudice and with costs in favor of Chevron. In June 2012, the plaintiffs filed a recognition and enforcement action against
Chevron Corporation in the Superior Court of Justice in Brasilia, Brazil. In May 2015, the Brazilian public prosecutor issued an
opinion recommending that the court reject the plaintiffs’ action on grounds including that the Lago Agrio judgment was procured
through fraud and corruption and violated Brazilian and international public order. In November 2017, the Superior Court of Justice
dismissed the plaintiffs’ recognition and enforcement action on jurisdictional grounds, and in June 2018 the dismissal became final
in Brazil. In October 2012, the provincial court in Ecuador issued an ex parte embargo order purporting to order the seizure of
assets belonging to separate Chevron subsidiaries in Ecuador, Argentina and Colombia. In November 2012, at the request of the
plaintiffs, a court in Argentina issued a freeze order against Chevron Argentina S.R.L. and another Chevron subsidiary. In January
2013, an appellate court upheld the freeze order, but in June 2013, the Supreme Court of Argentina revoked the freeze order in its
entirety. In December 2013, Chevron was served with the plaintiffs’ complaint seeking recognition and enforcement of the
judgment in Argentina. In April 2016, the public prosecutor in Argentina issued an opinion recommending rejection of the plaintiffs’
request to recognize the Ecuadorian judgment in Argentina. In November 2017, the National Court, First Instance, dismissed the
complaint on jurisdictional grounds and the Federal Civil Court of Appeals affirmed the dismissal in July 2018. The plaintiffs’
appeal to the Supreme Court of Argentina remains pending. Chevron continues to believe the Ecuadorian judgment is illegitimate
and unenforceable because it is the product of fraud and corruption, and contrary to the law and all legitimate scientific evidence.
Chevron cannot predict the timing or outcome of any pending or threatened enforcement action, but expects to continue a vigorous
defense against any imposition of liability and to contest and defend any and all enforcement actions.
In February 2011, Chevron filed a civil lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against the Lago
Agrio plaintiffs and several of their lawyers and supporters, asserting violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations (RICO) Act and state law. In March 2014, the District Court entered a judgment in favor of Chevron, finding that the
Ecuadorian judgment had been procured through fraud, bribery and corruption, and prohibiting the RICO defendants from seeking
to enforce the Lago Agrio judgment in the United States or profiting from their illegal acts. In August 2016, the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Second Circuit issued a unanimous decision affirming the New York judgment in full. In June 2017, the U.S.
Supreme Court denied the RICO defendants’ petition for a Writ of Certiorari, rendering the New York judgment in favor of Chevron
final.
Chevron and Texpet filed an arbitration claim in September 2009 against the Republic of Ecuador before an arbitral tribunal
administered by the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague, under the Rules of the United Nations Commission on
International Trade Law. The claim alleged violations of Ecuador’s obligations under the United States-Ecuador Bilateral
Investment Treaty (BIT) and breaches of the settlement and release agreements between Ecuador and Texpet. In January 2012, the
Tribunal issued its First Interim Measures Award requiring Ecuador to take all measures at its disposal to suspend or cause to be
suspended the enforcement or recognition within and outside of Ecuador of any judgment against Chevron in the Lago Agrio case
pending further order of the Tribunal. In February 2012, the Tribunal issued a Second
73
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts
Interim Award mandating that Ecuador take all measures necessary to suspend or cause to be suspended enforcement and
recognition proceedings within and outside of Ecuador. Also in February 2012, the Tribunal issued a Third Interim Award
confirming its jurisdiction to hear Chevron and Texpet’s claims. In February 2013, the Tribunal issued its Fourth Interim Award in
which it declared that Ecuador had violated the First and Second Interim Awards. The Tribunal divided the merits phase of the
arbitration into three phases. In September 2013, after the conclusion of Phase One, the Tribunal issued its First Partial Award,
finding that the settlement agreements between Ecuador and Texpet applied to both Texpet and Chevron and released them from
public environmental claims arising from the consortium’s operations, but did not preclude individual claims for personal harm. In
August 2018, the Tribunal issued its Phase Two award, again in favor of Chevron and Texpet. The Tribunal unanimously held that
the Lago Agrio judgment was procured through fraud, bribery and corruption and was based on public claims that Ecuador had
settled and released. According to the Tribunal, the Ecuadorian judgment “violates international public policy” and “should not be
recognized or enforced by the courts of other States.” The Tribunal found that: (i) Ecuador breached its obligations under the
settlement agreements releasing Texpet and its affiliates from public environmental claims; (ii) Ecuador committed a denial of
justice under international law and violated the U.S.-Ecuador BIT due to the fraud and corruption in the Lago Agrio litigation; and
(iii) Texpet satisfied its environmental remediation obligations through the remediation program that Ecuador supervised and
approved. The Tribunal ordered Ecuador to: (a) take immediate steps to remove the status of enforceability from the Ecuadorian
judgment; (b) take measures to “wipe out all the consequences” of Ecuador’s “internationally wrongful acts in regard to the
Ecuadorian judgment;” and (c) compensate Chevron for any injuries resulting from the Ecuadorian judgment. The final Phase
Three of the arbitration, at which damages for Chevron’s injuries will be determined, was set for hearing in March 2021. Ecuador
filed in the District Court of The Hague a request to set aside the Tribunal’s Interim Awards and its First Partial Award, and in
January 2016 that court denied Ecuador’s request. In July 2017, the Appeals Court of the Netherlands denied Ecuador’s appeal, and
in April 2019, the Supreme Court of the Netherlands upheld the decision of the Appeals Court and finally rejected Ecuador’s
challenges to the Tribunal’s Interim Awards and its First Partial Award. In December 2018, Ecuador filed in the District Court of
The Hague a request to set aside the Tribunal’s Phase Two Award.
Management’s Assessment The ultimate outcome of the foregoing matters, including any financial effect on Chevron, remains
uncertain. Management does not believe an estimate of a reasonably possible loss (or a range of loss) can be made in this case. Due
to the defects associated with the Ecuadorian judgment, management does not believe the judgment has any utility in calculating a
reasonably possible loss (or a range of loss). Moreover, the highly uncertain legal environment surrounding the case provides no
basis for management to estimate a reasonably possible loss (or a range of loss).

The 2019 decrease in income tax expense of $3,024 is a result of the year-over-year decrease in total income before income tax
expense, which is primarily due to the impairment and project write-off charges in 2019. The company’s effective tax rate changed
from 28 percent in 2018 to 49 percent in 2019. The change in effective tax rate is a consequence of mix effect resulting from the
absolute level of earnings or losses and whether they arose in higher or lower tax rate jurisdictions, including a tax charge related to
cash repatriation and the impact of asset sales and corporate rate reductions.
The company records its deferred taxes on a tax-jurisdiction basis. The reported deferred tax balances are composed of the
following:
  At December 31

* Beginning in 2019, the deferred taxes that are the consequence of ASU 2016-02 are included in the “Investments and other” and “Operating lease” balances above. Refer to Note 5,
“Lease Commitments” beginning on page 62.
Deferred tax liabilities at the end of 2019 decreased by approximately $2,500 from year-end 2018. The decrease was primarily
related to property, plant and equipment temporary differences due to upstream asset impairments. Deferred tax assets were
essentially unchanged from year-end 2018.
The overall valuation allowance relates to deferred tax assets for U.S. foreign tax credit carryforwards, tax loss carryforwards and
temporary differences. The valuation allowance reduces the deferred tax assets to amounts that are, in management’s assessment,
more likely than not to be realized. At the end of 2019, the company had tax loss carryforwards of approximately $13,419 and tax
credit carryforwards of approximately $1,058, primarily related to various international tax jurisdictions. Whereas some of these
tax loss carryforwards do not have an expiration date, others expire at various times from 2020 through 2034. U.S. foreign tax
credit carryforwards of $9,840 will expire between 2020 and 2029.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts
At December 31, 2019 and 2018, deferred taxes were classified on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as follows:
 At December 31
 2019 2018
Deferred charges and other assets $ (4,178) $ (4,399)
Noncurrent deferred income taxes 13,688 15,921
Total deferred income taxes, net $ 9,510 $ 11,522
Income taxes are not accrued for unremitted earnings of international operations that have been or are intended to be reinvested
indefinitely. The indefinite reinvestment assertion continues to apply for the purpose of determining deferred tax liabilities for U.S.
state and foreign withholding tax purposes.
U.S. state and foreign withholding taxes are not accrued for unremitted earnings of international operations that have been or are
intended to be reinvested indefinitely. Undistributed earnings of international consolidated subsidiaries and affiliates for which no
deferred income tax provision has been made for possible future remittances totaled approximately $52,500 at December 31, 2019.
This amount represents earnings reinvested as part of the company’s ongoing international business. It is not practicable to estimate
the amount of state and foreign taxes that might be payable on the possible remittance of earnings that are intended to be reinvested
indefinitely. The company does not anticipate incurring significant additional taxes on remittances of earnings that are not
indefinitely reinvested.
Uncertain Income Tax Positions The company recognizes a tax benefit in the financial statements for an uncertain tax position
only if management’s assessment is that the position is “more likely than not” (i.e., a likelihood greater than 50 percent) to be
allowed by the tax jurisdiction based solely on the technical merits of the position. The term “tax position” in the accounting
standards for income taxes refers to a position in a previously filed tax return or a position expected to be taken in a future tax
return that is reflected in measuring current or deferred income tax assets and liabilities for interim or annual periods.
The following table indicates the changes to the company’s unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018
and 2017. The term “unrecognized tax benefits” in the accounting standards for income taxes refers to the differences between a tax
position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and the benefit measured and recognized in the financial statements. Interest
and penalties are not included.

Settlements with taxing authorities in current year (78) (13) (1,173)
Reductions as a result of a lapse of the applicable statute of limitations (219) — (2)
Balance at December 31 $ 4,987 $ 5,070 $ 4,828
Approximately 81 percent of the $4,987 of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2019, would have an impact on the effective
tax rate if subsequently recognized. Certain of these unrecognized tax benefits relate to tax carryforwards that may require a full
valuation allowance at the time of any such recognition.
Tax positions for Chevron and its subsidiaries and affiliates are subject to income tax audits by many tax jurisdictions throughout
the world. For the company’s major tax jurisdictions, examinations of tax returns for certain prior tax years had not been completed
as of December 31, 2019. For these jurisdictions, the latest years for which income tax examinations had been finalized were as
follows: United States – 2013, Nigeria – 2000, Australia – 2009 and Kazakhstan – 2012.
The company engages in ongoing discussions with tax authorities regarding the resolution of tax matters in the various
jurisdictions. Both the outcome of these tax matters and the timing of resolution and/or closure of the tax audits are highly
uncertain. However, it is reasonably possible that developments on tax matters in certain tax jurisdictions may result in significant
increases or decreases in the company’s total unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months. Given the number of years that
still remain subject to examination and the number of matters being examined in the various tax jurisdictions, the company is
unable to estimate the range of possible adjustments to the balance of unrecognized tax benefits.
On the Consolidated Statement of Income, the company reports interest and penalties related to liabilities for uncertain tax
positions as “Income tax expense.” As of December 31, 2019, accruals of $30 for anticipated interest and penalty obligations were
included on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, compared with accruals of $33 as of year-end 2018. Income tax expense (benefit)
associated with interest and penalties was $(3), $8 and $(161) in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

Redeemable long-term obligations consist primarily of tax-exempt variable-rate put bonds that are included as current liabilities
because they become redeemable at the option of the bondholders during the year following the balance sheet date.
The company may periodically enter into interest rate swaps on a portion of its short-term debt. At December 31, 2019, the
company had no interest rate swaps on short-term debt.
At December 31, 2019, the company had $9,750 in 364-day committed credit facilities with various major banks that enable the
refinancing of short-term obligations on a long-term basis. The credit facilities allow the company to convert any amounts
outstanding into a term loan for a period of up to one year. This supports commercial paper borrowing and can also be used for
general corporate purposes. The company’s practice has been to continually replace expiring commitments with new commitments
on substantially the same terms, maintaining levels management believes appropriate. Any borrowings under the facility would be
unsecured indebtedness at interest rates based on the London Interbank Offered Rate or an average of base lending rates published
by specified banks and on terms reflecting the company’s strong credit rating. No borrowings were outstanding under this facility at
December 31, 2019.
The company classified $9,750 and $9,900 of short-term debt as long-term at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Settlement of these obligations is not expected to require the use of working capital within one year, and the company has both the
intent and the ability, as evidenced by committed credit facilities, to refinance them on a long-term basis.

Accounting for Suspended Exploratory Wells
The company continues to capitalize exploratory well costs after the completion of drilling when the well has found a sufficient
quantity of reserves to justify completion as a producing well, and the business unit is making sufficient progress assessing the
reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project. If either condition is not met or if the company obtains information
that raises substantial doubt about the economic or operational viability of the project, the exploratory well would be assumed to be
impaired, and its costs, net of any salvage value, would be charged to expense.

The following table indicates the changes to the company’s suspended exploratory well costs for the three years ended

Number of projects with exploratory well costs that have been capitalized for a period greater than one year* 22 30 32
*    Certain projects have multiple wells or fields or both.
Of the $2,827 of exploratory well costs capitalized for more than one year at December 31, 2019, $1,867 is related to 12 projects
that had drilling activities underway or firmly planned for the near future. The $960 balance is related to 10 projects in areas
requiring a major capital expenditure before production could begin and for which additional drilling efforts were not underway or
firmly planned for the near future. Additional drilling was not deemed necessary because the presence of hydrocarbons had already
been established, and other activities were in process to enable a future decision on project development.
The projects for the $960 referenced above had the following activities associated with assessing the reserves and the projects’
economic viability: (a) $256 (four projects) – undergoing front-end engineering and design with final investment decision expected
within four years; (b) $704 (six projects) – development alternatives under review. While progress was being made on all 22
projects, the decision on the recognition of proved reserves under SEC rules in some cases may not occur for several years because
of the complexity, scale and negotiations associated with the projects. More than half of these decisions are expected to occur in the
next five years.
The $2,827 of suspended well costs capitalized for a period greater than one year as of December 31, 2019, represents 123
exploratory wells in 22 projects. The tables below contain the aging of these costs on a well and project basis:
Aging based on drilling completion date of individual wells: Amount Number of wells

Stock Options and Other Share-Based Compensation
Compensation expense for stock options for 2019, 2018 and 2017 was $81 ($64 after tax), $105 ($83 after tax) and $137 ($89 after
tax), respectively. In addition, compensation expense for stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, performance shares and
restricted stock units was $313 ($266 after tax), $60 ($47 after tax) and $231 ($150 after tax) for 2019, 2018 and 2017,
respectively. No significant stock-based compensation cost was capitalized at December 31, 2019, or December 31, 2018.
Cash received in payment for option exercises under all share-based payment arrangements for 2019, 2018 and 2017 was $1,090,
$1,159 and $1,100, respectively. Actual tax benefits realized for the tax deductions from option exercises were $43, $43 and $48 for
2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

Cash paid to settle performance shares, restricted stock units and stock appreciation rights was $119, $157 and $187 for 2019, 2018
and 2017, respectively.
Awards under the Chevron Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) may take the form of, but are not limited to, stock options, restricted
stock, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights, performance shares and nonstock grants. From April 2004 through May
2023, no more than 260 million shares may be issued under the LTIP. For awards issued on or after May 29, 2013, no more than 50
million of those shares may be in a form other than a stock option, stock appreciation right or award requiring full payment for
shares by the award recipient. For the major types of awards issued before January 1, 2017, the contractual terms vary between
three years for the performance shares and restricted stock units, and 10 years for the stock options and stock appreciation rights.
For awards issued after January 1, 2017, contractual terms vary between three years for the performance shares and special
restricted stock units, five years for standard restricted stock units and 10 years for the stock options and stock appreciation rights.
Forfeitures for performance shares, restricted stock units, and stock appreciation rights are recognized as they occur. Forfeitures for
stock options are estimated using historical forfeiture data dating back to 1990.
The fair market values of stock options and stock appreciation rights granted in 2019, 2018 and 2017 were measured on the date of
grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, with the following weighted-average assumptions:

The total intrinsic value (i.e., the difference between the exercise price and the market price) of options exercised during 2019,
2018 and 2017 was $516, $506 and $407, respectively. During this period, the company continued its practice of issuing treasury
shares upon exercise of these awards.
As of December 31, 2019, there was $55 of total unrecognized before-tax compensation cost related to nonvested share-based
compensation arrangements granted under the plan. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of
1.8 years.
At January 1, 2019, the number of LTIP performance shares outstanding was equivalent to 3,669,730 shares. During 2019,
1,813,188 performance shares were granted, 684,620 shares vested with cash proceeds distributed to recipients and 411,514 shares
were forfeited. At December 31, 2019, performance shares outstanding were 4,386,784. The fair value of the liability recorded for
these instruments was $370, and was measured using the Monte Carlo simulation method.
At January 1, 2019, the number of restricted stock units outstanding was equivalent to 1,737,479 shares. During 2019, 1,054,556
restricted stock units were granted, 244,744 units vested with cash proceeds distributed to recipients and 120,332 units were
forfeited. At December 31, 2019, restricted stock units outstanding were 2,426,959. The fair value of the liability recorded for the
vested portion of these instruments was $192, valued at the stock price as of December 31, 2019. In addition, outstanding stock
appreciation rights that were granted under LTIP totaled approximately 4.0 million equivalent shares as of December 31, 2019. The
fair value of the liability recorded for the vested portion of these instruments was $82.

Employee Benefit Plans
The company has defined benefit pension plans for many employees. The company typically prefunds defined benefit plans as
required by local regulations or in certain situations where prefunding provides economic advantages. In the United States, all
qualified plans are subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) minimum funding standard. The company
does not typically fund U.S. nonqualified pension plans that are not subject to funding requirements under laws and regulations
because contributions to these pension plans may be less economic and investment returns may be less attractive than the
company’s other investment alternatives.
The company also sponsors other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans that provide medical and dental benefits, as well as life
insurance for some active and qualifying retired employees. The plans are unfunded, and the company and retirees share the costs.
For the company’s main U.S. medical plan, the increase to the pre-Medicare company contribution for retiree medical coverage is
limited to no more than 4 percent each year. Certain life insurance benefits are paid by the company.
The company recognizes the overfunded or underfunded status of each of its defined benefit pension and OPEB plans as an asset or
liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
The funded status of the company’s pension and OPEB plans for 2019 and 2018 follows:

Net actuarial losses recorded in “Accumulated other comprehensive loss” at December 31, 2019, for the company’s U.S. pension,
international pension and OPEB plans are being amortized on a straight-line basis over approximately 10, 12 and 14 years,
respectively. These amortization periods represent the estimated average remaining service of employees expected to receive
benefits under the plans. These losses are amortized to the extent they exceed 10 percent of the higher of the projected benefit
obligation or market-related value of plan assets. The amount subject to amortization is determined on a plan-by-plan basis. During
2020, the company estimates actuarial losses of $385, $46 and $3 will be amortized from “Accumulated other comprehensive loss”
for U.S. pension, international pension and OPEB plans, respectively. In addition, the company estimates an additional $320 will be
recognized from “Accumulated other comprehensive loss” during 2020 related to lump-sum settlement costs from the main U.S.
pension plans.
The weighted average amortization period for recognizing prior service costs (credits) recorded in “Accumulated other
comprehensive loss” at December 31, 2019, was approximately 3 and 6 years for U.S. and international pension plans, respectively,
and 8 years for OPEB plans. During 2020, the company estimates prior service (credits) costs of $2, $10 and

Rate of compensation increase 4.5% 4.0% 4.5% 4.0% 4.5% 4.5% N/A  N/A N/A
Expected Return on Plan Assets The company’s estimated long-term rates of return on pension assets are driven primarily by
actual historical asset-class returns, an assessment of expected future performance, advice from external actuarial firms and the
incorporation of specific asset-class risk factors. Asset allocations are periodically updated using pension plan asset/liability studies,
and the company’s estimated long-term rates of return are consistent with these studies.
For 2019, the company used an expected long-term rate of return of 6.75 percent for U.S. pension plan assets, which account for 68
percent of the company’s pension plan assets. In both 2018 and 2017, the company used a long-term rate of return of 6.75 percent
for these plans.
The market-related value of assets of the main U.S. pension plan used in the determination of pension expense was based on the
market values in the three months preceding the year-end measurement date. Management considers the three-month time period
long enough to minimize the effects of distortions from day-to-day market volatility and still be contemporaneous to the end of the
year. For other plans, market value of assets as of year-end is used in calculating the pension expense.
Discount Rate The discount rate assumptions used to determine the U.S. and international pension and OPEB plan obligations and
expense reflect the rate at which benefits could be effectively settled, and are equal to the equivalent single rate resulting from yield
curve analysis. This analysis considered the projected benefit payments specific to the company’s plans and the yields on high-
quality bonds. The projected cash flows were discounted to the valuation date using the yield curve for the main U.S. pension and
OPEB plans. The effective discount rates derived from this analysis at the end of 2019 were 3.1 percent for the main U.S. pension
plan and 3.1 percent for the main U.S. OPEB plan. The discount rates for these plans at the end of 2018 were 4.2 and 4.3 percent,
respectively, while in 2017 they were 3.5 and 3.6 percent for these plans, respectively.
Other Benefit Assumptions Assumed health care cost-trend rates can have a significant effect on the amounts reported for retiree
health care costs. For the measurement of accumulated postretirement benefit obligation at December 31, 2019, for the main U.S.
OPEB plan, the assumed health care cost-trend rates start with 6.8 percent in 2020 and gradually decline to 4.5 percent for 2025
and beyond. For this measurement at December 31, 2018, the assumed health care cost-trend rates started with 7.2 percent in 2019
and gradually declined to 4.5 percent for 2025 and beyond. A 1-percentage-point change in the assumed health care cost-trend rates
would have the following effects on worldwide plans:
  1 Percent Increase 1 Percent Decrease
Effect on total service and interest cost components $ 20 $ (15)
Effect on postretirement benefit obligation $ 224 $ (176)

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts
The primary investment objectives of the pension plans are to achieve the highest rate of total return within prudent levels of risk
and liquidity, to diversify and mitigate potential downside risk associated with the investments, and to provide adequate liquidity
for benefit payments and portfolio management.
The company’s U.S. and U.K. pension plans comprise 92 percent of the total pension assets. Both the U.S. and U.K. plans have an
Investment Committee that regularly meets during the year to review the asset holdings and their returns. To assess the plans’
investment performance, long-term asset allocation policy benchmarks have been established.
For the primary U.S. pension plan, the company’s Investment Committee has established the following approved asset allocation
ranges: Equities 30–60 percent, Fixed Income 20–40 percent, Real Estate 0–15 percent, Alternative Investments 0–15 percent and
Cash 0–25 percent. For the U.K. pension plan, the U.K. Board of Trustees has established the following asset allocation guidelines:
Equities 10–30 percent, Fixed Income 55–85 percent, Real Estate 5–15 percent, and Cash 0–5 percent. The other significant
international pension plans also have established maximum and minimum asset allocation ranges that vary by plan. Actual asset
allocation within approved ranges is based on a variety of factors, including market conditions and illiquidity constraints. To
mitigate concentration and other risks, assets are invested across multiple asset classes with active investment managers and passive
index funds.
The company does not prefund its OPEB obligations.
Cash Contributions and Benefit Payments In 2019, the company contributed $1,096 and $266 to its U.S. and international pension
plans, respectively. In 2020, the company expects contributions to be approximately $1,250 to its U.S. plans and $250 to its
international pension plans. Actual contribution amounts are dependent upon investment returns, changes in pension obligations,
regulatory environments, tax law changes and other economic factors. Additional funding may ultimately be required if investment
returns are insufficient to offset increases in plan obligations.
The company anticipates paying OPEB benefits of approximately $174 in 2020; $168 was paid in 2019.
The following benefit payments, which include estimated future service, are expected to be paid by the company in the next
10 years:
 Pension Benefits  Other
 U.S. Int’l. Benefits
2020 $ 1,262 $ 280 $ 174
2021 $ 1,176 $ 602 $ 170
2022 $ 1,160 $ 224 $ 165
2023 $ 1,150 $ 234 $ 161
2024 $ 1,134 $ 255 $ 156
2024-2028 $ 5,232 $ 1,434 $ 725
Employee Savings Investment Plan Eligible employees of Chevron and certain of its subsidiaries participate in the Chevron
Employee Savings Investment Plan (ESIP). Compensation expense for the ESIP totaled $284, $270 and $316 in 2019, 2018 and
2017, respectively.
Benefit Plan Trusts Prior to its acquisition by Chevron, Texaco established a benefit plan trust for funding obligations under some
of its benefit plans. At year-end 2019, the trust contained 14.2 million shares of Chevron treasury stock. The trust will sell the
shares or use the dividends from the shares to pay benefits only to the extent that the company does not pay such benefits. The
company intends to continue to pay its obligations under the benefit plans. The trustee will vote the shares held in the trust as
instructed by the trust’s beneficiaries. The shares held in the trust are not considered outstanding for earnings-per-share purposes
until distributed or sold by the trust in payment of benefit obligations.
Prior to its acquisition by Chevron, Unocal established various grantor trusts to fund obligations under some of its benefit plans,
including the deferred compensation and supplemental retirement plans. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, trust assets of $35 and
$34, respectively, were invested primarily in interest-earning accounts.
Employee Incentive Plans The Chevron Incentive Plan is an annual cash bonus plan for eligible employees that links awards to
corporate, business unit and individual performance in the prior year. Charges to expense for cash bonuses were $826, $1,048 and
$936 in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Chevron also has the LTIP for officers and other regular salaried employees of the
company and its subsidiaries who hold positions of significant responsibility. Awards under the LTIP consist of stock options and
other share-based compensation that are described in Note 20, beginning on page 80.

Other Contingencies and Commitments
Income Taxes The company calculates its income tax expense and liabilities quarterly. These liabilities generally are subject to
audit and are not finalized with the individual taxing authorities until several years after the end of the annual period for which
income taxes have been calculated. Refer to Note 15, beginning on page 74, for a discussion of the periods for which tax returns
have been audited for the company’s major tax jurisdictions and a discussion for all tax jurisdictions of the differences between the
amount of tax benefits recognized in the financial statements and the amount taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.
Settlement of open tax years, as well as other tax issues in countries where the company conducts its businesses, are not expected to
have a material effect on the consolidated financial position or liquidity of the company and, in the opinion of management,
adequate provisions have been made for all years under examination or subject to future examination.
Guarantees The company has two guarantees to equity affiliates totaling $704. Of this amount, $412 is associated with a financing
arrangement with an equity affiliate. Over the approximate 2-year remaining term of this guarantee, the maximum amount will be
reduced as payments are made by the affiliate. The remaining amount of $292 is associated with certain payments under a terminal
use agreement entered into by an equity affiliate. Over the approximate 8-year remaining term of this guarantee, the maximum
guarantee amount will be reduced as certain fees are paid by the affiliate. There are numerous cross-indemnity agreements with the
affiliate and the other partners to permit recovery of amounts paid under the guarantee. Chevron has recorded no liability for either
guarantee.
Indemnifications In the acquisition of Unocal, the company assumed certain indemnities relating to contingent environmental
liabilities associated with assets that were sold in 1997. The acquirer of those assets shared in certain environmental remediation
costs up to a maximum obligation of $200, which had been reached at December 31, 2009. Under the indemnification agreement,
after reaching the $200 obligation, Chevron is solely responsible until April 2022, when the indemnification expires. The
environmental conditions or events that are subject to these indemnities must have arisen prior to the sale of the assets in 1997.
Although the company has provided for known obligations under this indemnity that are probable and reasonably estimable, the
amount of additional future costs may be material to results of operations in the period in which they are recognized. The company
does not expect these costs will have a material effect on its consolidated financial position or liquidity.
Long-Term Unconditional Purchase Obligations and Commitments, Including Throughput and Take-or-Pay Agreements The
company and its subsidiaries have certain contingent liabilities with respect to long-term unconditional purchase obligations and
commitments, including throughput and take-or-pay agreements, some of which may relate to suppliers’ financing arrangements.
The agreements typically provide goods and services, such as pipeline and storage capacity, utilities, and petroleum products, to be
used or sold in the ordinary course of the company’s business. The aggregate approximate amounts of required payments under
these various commitments are: 2020 – $900; 2021 – $1,100; 2022 – $1,100; 2023 – $1,200; 2024 – $1,200; 2025 and after –
$7,200. A portion of these commitments may ultimately be shared with project partners. Total payments under the agreements were
approximately $800 in 2019, $1,400 in 2018 and $1,300 in 2017.
As part of the implementation of ASU 2016-02, the company assessed some contracts, previously incorporated into the
unconditional purchase obligations disclosure, as operating leases in 2019.
Environmental The company is subject to loss contingencies pursuant to laws, regulations, private claims and legal proceedings
related to environmental matters that are subject to legal settlements or that in the future may require the company to take action to
correct or ameliorate the effects on the environment of prior release of chemicals or petroleum substances, including MTBE, by the
company or other parties. Such contingencies may exist for various operating, closed and divested sites, including, but not limited
to, federal Superfund sites and analogous sites under state laws, refineries, chemical plants, marketing facilities, crude oil fields,
and mining sites.
Although the company has provided for known environmental obligations that are probable and reasonably estimable, it is likely
that the company will continue to incur additional liabilities. The amount of additional future costs are not fully determinable due to
such factors as the unknown magnitude of possible contamination, the unknown timing and extent of the corrective actions that
may be required, the determination of the company’s liability in proportion to other responsible parties, and the extent to which
such costs are recoverable from third parties. These future costs may be material to results of operations in the period in which they
are recognized, but the company does not expect these costs will have a material effect on its consolidated financial position or
liquidity.
87
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts
Chevron’s environmental reserve as of December 31, 2019, was $1,234. Included in this balance was $266 related to remediation
activities at approximately 145 sites for which the company had been identified as a potentially responsible party under the
provisions of the federal Superfund law or analogous state laws which provide for joint and several liability for all responsible
parties. Any future actions by regulatory agencies to require Chevron to assume other potentially responsible parties’ costs at
designated hazardous waste sites are not expected to have a material effect on the company’s results of operations, consolidated
financial position or liquidity.
Of the remaining year-end 2019 environmental reserves balance of $968, $667 is related to the company’s U.S. downstream
operations, $28 to its international downstream operations, $272 to upstream operations and $1 to other businesses. Liabilities at all
sites were primarily associated with the company’s plans and activities to remediate soil or groundwater contamination or both.
The company manages environmental liabilities under specific sets of regulatory requirements, which in the United States include
the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and various state and local regulations. No single remediation site at year-end 2019
had a recorded liability that was material to the company’s results of operations, consolidated financial position or liquidity.
Refer to Note 23 on page 89 for a discussion of the company’s asset retirement obligations.
Other Contingencies Governmental and other entities in California and other jurisdictions have filed legal proceedings against
fossil fuel producing companies, including Chevron, purporting to seek legal and equitable relief to address alleged impacts of
climate change. Further such proceedings are likely to be filed by other parties. The unprecedented legal theories set forth in these
proceedings entail the possibility of damages liability and injunctions against the production of all fossil fuels that, while we
believe remote, could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations and financial condition. Management
believes that these proceedings are legally and factually meritless and detract from constructive efforts to address the important
policy issues presented by climate change, and will vigorously defend against such proceedings.
Chevron has interests in Venezuelan crude oil production assets operated by independent equity affiliates. During 2019, net oil
equivalent production in Venezuela averaged 35,000 barrels per day, 3,000 barrels per day of which was upgraded to synthetic
crude. Synthetic crude production in 2019 was impacted by operating conditions, including a shutdown of the Petropiar heavy oil
upgrader for part of the year. The operating environment in Venezuela has been deteriorating for some time. In January 2019, the
United States government issued sanctions against the Venezuelan national oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela, S.A. (PdVSA),
which is the company’s partner in the equity affiliates. The company is conducting its business pursuant to general licenses and
guidance issued coincident with the sanctions. In late July 2019, the United States government renewed General License 8A with
the issuance of General License 8B, subsequently superseded by General License 8C issued on August 5, 2019. The authorization
provided to Chevron under General License 8C was extended by General License 8D on October 21, 2019 and General License 8E
issued by the United States government on January 17, 2020. General License 8E enables the company to continue to meet its
contractual obligations in Venezuela with PdVSA and is effective until April 22, 2020.
At December 31, 2019, the carrying value of the company’s investments was approximately $2,650 and for the year ended
December 31, 2019, the company recognized losses of $54 for its share of net income from the equity affiliates, and for demurrage,
foreign exchange losses and other costs incurred in support of the company’s operations in Venezuela. Future events could result in
the environment in Venezuela becoming more challenged, which could lead to increased business disruption and volatility in the
associated financial results. The company continues to evaluate the carrying value of its Venezuelan investments in line with its
accounting policies. Future events related to the company’s activities in Venezuela may result in significant impacts on the
company’s results of operation in subsequent periods. Please see Note 13, “Investments and Advances”, on page 71 for further
information on the company’s investments in equity affiliates in Venezuela.
Chevron receives claims from and submits claims to customers; trading partners; joint venture partners; U.S. federal, state and local
regulatory bodies; governments; contractors; insurers; suppliers; and individuals. The amounts of these claims, individually and in
the aggregate, may be significant and take lengthy periods to resolve, and may result in gains or losses in future periods.
The company and its affiliates also continue to review and analyze their operations and may close, retire, sell, exchange, acquire or
restructure assets to achieve operational or strategic benefits and to improve competitiveness and profitability. These activities,
individually or together, may result in significant gains or losses in future periods.

Note 23
Asset Retirement Obligations
The company records the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation (ARO) both as an asset and a liability when there
is a legal obligation associated with the retirement of a tangible long-lived asset and the liability can be reasonably estimated. The
legal obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is unconditional, even though uncertainty may exist about the timing and/or
method of settlement that may be beyond the company’s control. This uncertainty about the timing and/or method of settlement is
factored into the measurement of the liability when sufficient information exists to reasonably estimate fair value. Recognition of
the ARO includes: (1) the present value of a liability and offsetting asset, (2) the subsequent accretion of that liability and
depreciation of the asset, and (3) the periodic review of the ARO liability estimates and discount rates.
AROs are primarily recorded for the company’s crude oil and natural gas producing assets. No significant AROs associated with
any legal obligations to retire downstream long-lived assets have been recognized, as indeterminate settlement dates for the asset
retirements prevent estimation of the fair value of the associated ARO. The company performs periodic reviews of its downstream
long-lived assets for any changes in facts and circumstances that might require recognition of a retirement obligation.
The following table indicates the changes to the company’s before-tax asset retirement obligations in 2019, 2018 and 2017:
 2019 2018 2017
Balance at January 1 $ 14,050 $ 14,214 $ 14,243
Liabilities incurred 32 96 684
Liabilities settled (1,694) (830) (1,721)
Accretion expense 628 654 668
Revisions in estimated cash flows (184) (84) 340
Balance at December 31 $ 12,832 $ 14,050 $ 14,214
In the table above, the amount associated with “Revisions in estimated cash flows” in 2019 reflects decreased cost estimates to
decommission wells, equipment and facilities. The long-term portion of the $12,832 balance at the end of 2019 was $11,592.
Note 24
Revenue
Revenue from contracts with customers is presented in “Sales and other operating revenue” along with some activity that is
accounted for outside the scope of Accounting Standard Codification (ASC) 606, which is not material to this line, on the
Consolidated Statement of Income. Purchases and sales of inventory with the same counterparty that are entered into in
contemplation of one another (including buy/sell arrangements) are combined and recorded on a net basis and reported in
“purchased crude oil and products” on the Consolidated Statement of Income. Refer to Note 12 beginning on page 68 for additional
information on the company’s segmentation of revenue.
Receivables related to revenue from contracts with customers are included in “Accounts and notes receivable, net” on the
Consolidated Balance Sheet, net of the allowance for doubtful accounts. The net balance of these receivables was $9,247 and
$10,046 at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. Other items included in “Accounts and notes receivable, net”
represent amounts due from partners for their share of joint venture operating and project costs and amounts due from others,
primarily related to derivatives, leases, buy/sell arrangements and product exchanges, which are accounted for outside the scope of
ASC 606.
Contract assets and related costs are reflected in “Prepaid expenses and other current assets” and contract liabilities are reflected in
“Accrued liabilities” and “Deferred credits and other noncurrent obligations” on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Amounts for
these items are not material to the company’s financial position.
Note 25
Other Financial Information
Earnings in 2019 included after-tax gains of approximately $1,500 relating to the sale of certain properties. Of this amount,
approximately $50 and $1,450 related to downstream and upstream, respectively. Earnings in 2018 included after-tax gains of
approximately $630 relating to the sale of certain properties, of which approximately $365 and $265 related to downstream and
upstream assets, respectively. Earnings in 2019 included after-tax charges of approximately $10,400 for impairments and other
asset write-offs related to upstream. Earnings in 2018 included after-tax charges of approximately $2,000 for impairments and other
asset write-offs related to upstream.

Reserves Governance The company has adopted a comprehensive reserves and resource classification system modeled after a
system developed and approved by a number of organizations including the Society of Petroleum Engineers, the World Petroleum
Congress and the American Association of Petroleum Geologists. The company classifies recoverable hydrocarbons into six
categories based on their status at the time of reporting – three deemed commercial and three potentially recoverable. Within the
commercial classification are proved reserves and two categories of unproved reserves: probable and possible. The potentially
recoverable categories are also referred to as contingent resources. For reserves estimates to be classified as proved, they must meet
all SEC and company standards.
Proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities that geoscience and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty
to be economically producible in the future from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions, operating methods and
government regulations. Net proved reserves exclude royalties and interests owned by others and reflect contractual arrangements
and royalty obligations in effect at the time of the estimate.
Proved reserves are classified as either developed or undeveloped. Proved developed reserves are the quantities expected to be
recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods. Proved undeveloped reserves are the quantities
expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is
required for recompletion.
Due to the inherent uncertainties and the limited nature of reservoir data, estimates of reserves are subject to change as additional
information becomes available.
Proved reserves are estimated by company asset teams composed of earth scientists and engineers. As part of the internal control
process related to reserves estimation, the company maintains a Reserves Advisory Committee (RAC) that is chaired by the
Manager of Global Reserves, an organization that is separate from the Upstream operating organization. The Manager
96
Supplemental Information on Oil and Gas Producing Activities - Unaudited
of Global Reserves has more than 30 years’ experience working in the oil and gas industry and holds both undergraduate and
graduate degrees in geoscience. His experience includes various technical and management roles in providing reserve and resource
estimates in support of major capital and exploration projects, and more than 10 years of overseeing oil and gas reserves processes.
He has been named a Distinguished Lecturer by the American Association of Petroleum Geologists and is an active member of the
American Association of Petroleum Geologists, the SEPM Society of Sedimentary Geologists and the Society of Petroleum
Engineers.
All RAC members are degreed professionals, each with more than 10 years of experience in various aspects of reserves estimation
relating to reservoir engineering, petroleum engineering, earth science or finance. The members are knowledgeable in SEC
guidelines for proved reserves classification and receive annual training on the preparation of reserves estimates.
The RAC has the following primary responsibilities: establish the policies and processes used within the operating units to estimate
reserves; provide independent reviews and oversight of the business units’ recommended reserves estimates and changes; confirm
that proved reserves are recognized in accordance with SEC guidelines; determine that reserve volumes are calculated using
consistent and appropriate standards, procedures and technology; and maintain the Chevron Corporation Reserves Manual, which
provides standardized procedures used corporatewide for classifying and reporting hydrocarbon reserves.
During the year, the RAC is represented in meetings with each of the company’s upstream business units to review and discuss
reserve changes recommended by the various asset teams. Major changes are also reviewed with the company’s senior leadership
team including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer. The company’s annual reserve activity is also reviewed
with the Board of Directors. If major changes to reserves were to occur between the annual reviews, those matters would also be
discussed with the Board.
RAC subteams also conduct in-depth reviews during the year of many of the fields that have large proved reserves quantities. These
reviews include an examination of the proved-reserve records and documentation of their compliance with the Chevron
Corporation Reserves Manual.
Technologies Used in Establishing Proved Reserves Additions In 2019, additions to Chevron’s proved reserves were based on a
wide range of geologic and engineering technologies. Information generated from wells, such as well logs, wire line sampling,
production and pressure testing, fluid analysis, and core analysis, was integrated with seismic data, regional geologic studies, and
information from analogous reservoirs to provide “reasonably certain” proved reserves estimates. Both proprietary and
commercially available analytic tools, including reservoir simulation, geologic modeling and seismic processing, have been used in
the interpretation of the subsurface data. These technologies have been utilized extensively by the company in the past, and the
company believes that they provide a high degree of confidence in establishing reliable and consistent reserves estimates.
Proved Undeveloped Reserves At the end of 2019, proved undeveloped reserves totaled 4.0 billion barrels of oil-equivalent (BOE),
a decrease of 641 million BOE from year-end 2018. The decrease was due to 685 million BOE in revisions, the transfer of 593
million BOE to proved developed and 31 million BOE in sales, partially offset by 635 million BOE in extensions and discoveries,
26 million BOE in acquisitions and 7 million BOE in improved recovery. A major portion of the reserves revisions are attributed to
the company’s decision to reduce planned developments and evaluate strategic alternatives, including divestment scenarios for it’s
acreage in the Appalachian region.
During 2019, investments totaling approximately $10.5 billion in oil and gas producing activities and about $0.1 billion in non-oil
and gas producing activities were expended to advance the development of proved undeveloped reserves. In Asia, expenditures
during the year totaled approximately $5.3 billion, primarily related to development projects of the TCO affiliate in Kazakhstan.
The United States accounted for about $3.3 billion related primarily to various development activities in the Gulf of Mexico and the
Midland and Delaware basins. In Africa, about $0.5 billion was expended on various offshore development and natural gas projects
in Nigeria, Angola and Republic of Congo. Development activities in Canada, Brazil and Argentina were primarily responsible for
about $1.0 billion of expenditures in Other Americas.
Reserves that remain proved undeveloped for five or more years are a result of several factors that affect optimal project
development and execution, such as the complex nature of the development project in adverse and remote locations, physical
limitations of infrastructure or plant capacities that dictate project timing, compression projects that are pending reservoir pressure
declines, and contractual limitations that dictate production levels.
At year-end 2019, the company held approximately 2.1 billion BOE of proved undeveloped reserves that have remained
undeveloped for five years or more. The majority of these reserves are in three locations where the company has a proven track
record of developing major projects. In Australia, approximately 700 million BOE have remained undeveloped for five years or
more related to the Gorgon and Wheatstone projects. Further field development to convert the remaining proved
97
Supplemental Information on Oil and Gas Producing Activities - Unaudited
undeveloped reserves is scheduled to occur in line with operating constraints and infrastructure optimization. In Africa,
approximately 300 million BOE have remained undeveloped for five years or more, primarily due to facility constraints at various
fields and infrastructure associated with the Escravos gas projects in Nigeria. Affiliates account for about 1.2 billion BOE of proved
undeveloped reserves with about 900 million BOE that have remained undeveloped for five years or more, with the majority related
to the TCO affiliate in Kazakhstan. At TCO, further field development to convert the remaining proved undeveloped reserves is
scheduled to occur in line with reservoir depletion and facility constraints.
Annually, the company assesses whether any changes have occurred in facts or circumstances, such as changes to development
plans, regulations or government policies, that would warrant a revision to reserve estimates. In 2019, decreases in commodity
prices negatively impacted the economic limits of oil and gas properties, resulting in proved reserve decreases, and positively
impacted proved reserves due to entitlement effects. The year-end reserves quantities have been updated for these circumstances
and significant changes have been discussed in the appropriate reserves sections. Over the past three years, the ratio of proved
undeveloped reserves to total proved reserves has ranged between 35 percent and 38 percent.
Proved Reserve Quantities For the three years ending December 31, 2019, the pattern of net reserve changes shown in the
following tables are not necessarily indicative of future trends. Apart from acquisitions, the company’s ability to add proved
reserves can be affected by events and circumstances that are outside the company’s control, such as delays in government
permitting, partner approvals of development plans, changes in oil and gas prices, OPEC constraints, geopolitical uncertainties, and
civil unrest.
At December 31, 2019, proved reserves for the company were 11.4 billion BOE. The company’s estimated net proved reserves of
liquids including crude oil, condensate and synthetic oil for the years 2017, 2018 and 2019 are shown in the table on page 99. The
company’s estimated net proved reserves of natural gas liquids are shown on page 100 and the company’s estimated net proved
reserves of natural gas are shown on page 101.
Noteworthy changes in crude oil, condensate and synthetic oil proved reserves for 2017 through 2019 are discussed below and
shown in the table on the following page:
Revisions In 2017, improved field performance at various Gulf of Mexico fields, including Jack/St Malo and Tahiti, and in the
Midland and Delaware basins were primarily responsible for the 209 million barrel increase in the United States. Improved field
performance at various fields, including Agbami and Sonam in Nigeria, were responsible for the 73 million barrel increase in
Africa. Synthetic oil reserves in Canada decreased by 42 million barrels, primarily due to entitlement effects. In the TCO affiliate in
Kazakhstan, entitlement effects were mainly responsible for the 52 million barrel decrease.
In 2018, improved field performance at various Gulf of Mexico fields and in the Midland and Delaware basins were primarily
responsible for the 121 million barrel increase in the United States. Improved field performance at various fields, including Agbami
in Nigeria and Moho-Bilondo in the Republic of Congo, were responsible for the 61 million barrel increase in Africa. Reserves in
Other Americas increased by 59 million barrels, primarily due to improved field performance at the Hebron field in Canada. In
Asia, improved performance across numerous assets resulted in the 37 million barrel increase.
In 2019, portfolio optimizations, where future drilling in various fields in the Midland and Delaware basins is being targeted away
from reservoirs with higher gas-to-oil ratios and lower execution efficiencies, and planned divestments in the Appalachian basin,
were primarily responsible for the 153 million barrel decrease in the United States. Operational issues with the Petropiar upgrader
in Venezuela resulted in a decrease in reserves of synthetic oil of 126 million barrels and an increase of crude oil and condensate
reserves of 105 million barrels. Reservoir management and entitlement effects were mainly responsible for 75 million barrels
increase in the TCO affiliate in Kazakhstan. Improved field performance at various fields, including Moho-Bilondo in the Republic
of Congo, Mafumeria in Angola, and Sonam in Nigeria, were responsible for the 42 million barrel increase in Africa.
Extensions and Discoveries In 2017, extensions and discoveries in the Midland and Delaware basins and the Gulf of Mexico were
primarily responsible for the 323 million barrel increase in the United States. Extensions and discoveries in the Duvernay Shale in
Canada were primarily responsible for the 63 million barrel increase in Other Americas.
In 2018, extensions and discoveries in the Midland and Delaware basins were primarily responsible for the 359 million barrel
increase in the United States. Extensions and discoveries in the Duvernay Shale in Canada and Loma Campana in Argentina were
primarily responsible for the 31 million barrel increase in Other Americas.

Supplemental Information on Oil and Gas Producing Activities - Unaudited
In 2019, portfolio optimizations, where future drilling in various fields in the Midland and Delaware basins is being targeted
towards liquids-rich reservoirs with higher execution efficiencies, and extensions and discoveries in the deepwater fields in the Gulf
of Mexico, were primarily responsible for the 394 million barrel increase in the United States. Extensions and discoveries in Loma
Campana in Argentina were primarily responsible for the 39 million barrel increase in Other Americas.
Purchases In 2017, purchases of 33 million barrels in Asia were due to contract extension in the Azeri-Chirag-Gunashli fields in
Azerbaijan.
In 2018, purchases of 31 million barrels in the United States were primarily in the Midland and Delaware basins.
Sales In 2017, sales of 51 million barrels in the United States were primarily in the Gulf of Mexico shelf and in the Midland and
Delaware basins.
In 2019, sales of 69 million barrels in Europe were in the United Kingdom and Denmark.

The standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows is calculated in accordance with SEC and FASB requirements. This
includes using the average of first-day-of-the-month oil and gas prices for the 12-month period prior to the end of the reporting
period, estimated future development and production costs assuming the continuation of existing economic conditions, estimated
costs for asset retirement obligations (includes costs to retire existing wells and facilities in addition to those future wells and
facilities necessary to produce proved undeveloped reserves), and estimated future income taxes based on appropriate statutory tax
rates. Discounted future net cash flows are calculated using 10 percent mid-period discount factors. Estimates of proved-reserve
quantities are imprecise and change over time as new information becomes available. Probable and possible reserves, which may
become proved in the future, are excluded from the calculations. The valuation requires assumptions as to the timing and amount of
future development and production costs. The calculations are made as of December 31 each year and do not represent
management’s estimate of the company’s future cash flows or value of its oil and gas reserves. In the following table, the caption
“Standardized Measure Net Cash Flows” refers to the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows.
