PART I
Item 1. Business
The Boeing Company, together with its subsidiaries (herein referred to as “Boeing,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” “our”), is
one of the world’s major aerospace firms.
We are organized based on the products and services we offer. We operate in four reportable segments:
•Commercial Airplanes (BCA);
•Defense, Space & Security (BDS);
•Global Services (BGS);
•Boeing Capital (BCC).
Commercial Airplanes Segment
This segment develops, produces and markets commercial jet aircraft and provides fleet support services, principally to
the commercial airline industry worldwide. We are a leading producer of commercial aircraft and offer a family of
commercial jetliners designed to meet a broad spectrum of global passenger and cargo requirements of airlines. This
family of commercial jet aircraft in production includes the 737 narrow-body model and the 747, 767, 777 and 787 wide-
body models. Development continues on certain 737 MAX derivatives and the 777X program.
Defense, Space & Security Segment
This segment is engaged in the research, development, production and modification of manned and unmanned military
aircraft and weapons systems for strike, surveillance and mobility, including fighter and trainer aircraft; vertical lift,
including rotorcraft and tilt-rotor aircraft; and commercial derivative aircraft, including anti-submarine and tanker aircraft.
In addition, this segment is engaged in the research, development, production and modification of the following
products and related services: strategic defense and intelligence systems, including strategic missile and defense
systems, command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (C4ISR), cyber
and information solutions, and intelligence systems; satellite systems, including government and commercial satellites
and space exploration.
BDS' primary customer is the United States Department of Defense (U.S. DoD). Revenues from the U.S. DoD,
including foreign military sales through the U.S. government, accounted for approximately 86% of its 2018 revenues.
Other significant BDS customers include the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and customers in
international defense, civil and commercial satellite markets.
This segment's primary products include the following fixed-wing military aircraft: F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, F-15 Strike
Eagle, P-8 programs, KC-46A Tanker, and T-X Trainer. This segment produces rotorcraft and rotary-wing programs,
such as CH-47 Chinook, AH-64 Apache, and V-22 Osprey. In addition, this segment's products include space and
missile systems including: government and commercial satellites, the International Space Station, Commercial Crew,
missile defense and weapons programs, and Joint Direct Attack Munition, as well as the United Launch Alliance joint
venture.
Global Services Segment
This segment provides services to our commercial and defense customers worldwide. BGS sustains aerospace
platforms and systems with a full spectrum of products and services, including supply chain and logistics management,
engineering, maintenance and modifications, upgrades and conversions, spare
1
Table of Contents
parts, pilot and maintenance training systems and services, technical and maintenance documents, and data analytics
and digital services.
Boeing Capital Segment
BCC seeks to ensure that Boeing customers have the financing they need to buy and take delivery of their Boeing
product and manages overall financing exposure. BCC’s portfolio consists of equipment under operating leases,
finance leases, notes and other receivables, assets held for sale or re-lease and investments.
Intellectual Property
We own numerous patents and have licenses for the use of patents owned by others, which relate to our products and
their manufacture. In addition to owning a large portfolio of intellectual property, we also license intellectual property to
and from third parties. For example, the U.S. government has licenses in our patents that are developed in
performance of government contracts, and it may use or authorize others to use the inventions covered by such
patents for government purposes. Unpatented research, development and engineering skills, as well as certain
trademarks, trade secrets, and other intellectual property rights, also make an important contribution to our business.
While our intellectual property rights in the aggregate are important to the operation of each of our businesses, we do
not believe that our business would be materially affected by the expiration of any particular intellectual property right or
termination of any particular intellectual property patent license agreement.
Employees
Total workforce level at December 31, 2018 was approximately 153,000. As of December 31, 2018, our principal
collective bargaining agreements were with the following unions:
UnionPercent of our
Employees
Represented Status of the Agreements with Major Union
The International Association of
Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM)22% We have two major agreements; one expiring in June
2022 and one in September 2024.
The Society of Professional Engineering
Employees in Aerospace (SPEEA)11% We have two major agreements expiring in October
2022.
The United Automobile, Aerospace and
Agricultural Implement Workers of
America (UAW)1% We have one major agreement expiring in October
2022.
Competition
The commercial jet aircraft market and the airline industry remain extremely competitive. We face aggressive
international competitors who are intent on increasing their market share, such as Airbus and other entrants from
Russia, China and Japan. We are focused on improving our processes and continuing cost reduction efforts. We intend
to continue to compete with other airplane manufacturers by providing customers with greater value products.
BDS faces strong competition in all market segments, primarily from Lockheed Martin Corporation, Northrop Grumman
Corporation, Raytheon Company, General Dynamics Corporation and SpaceX. Non-U.S. companies such as BAE
Systems and Airbus Group continue to build a strategic presence in the U.S.

Table of Contents
market by strengthening their North American operations and partnering with U.S. defense companies. In addition,
certain competitors have occasionally formed teams with other competitors to address specific customer requirements.
BDS expects the trend of strong competition to continue into 2019.
The commercial and defense services market is an extremely challenging landscape made up of many of the same
strong U.S. and non-U.S. competitors facing BCA and BDS along with other competitors in those markets. BGS
leverages our extensive services network offering products and services which span the life cycle of our defense and
commercial airplane programs: training, fleet services and logistics, maintenance and engineering, modifications and
upgrades - as well as the daily cycle of gate-to-gate operations. BGS expects the market to remain highly competitive
in 2019, and intends to grow market share by leveraging a high level of customer satisfaction and productivity.
Regulatory Matters
Our businesses are heavily regulated in most of our markets. We deal with numerous U.S. government agencies and
entities, including but not limited to all of the branches of the U.S. military, NASA, the Federal Aviation Administration
(FAA) and the Department of Homeland Security. Similar government authorities exist in our non-U.S. markets.
Government Contracts. The U.S. government, and other governments, may terminate any of our government contracts
at their convenience, as well as for default based on our failure to meet specified performance requirements. If any of
our U.S. government contracts were to be terminated for convenience, we generally would be entitled to receive
payment for work completed and allowable termination or cancellation costs. If any of our government contracts were to
be terminated for default, generally the U.S. government would pay only for the work that has been accepted and could
require us to pay the difference between the original contract price and the cost to re-procure the contract items, net of
the work accepted from the original contract. The U.S. government can also hold us liable for damages resulting from
the default.
Commercial Aircraft. In the U.S., our commercial aircraft products are required to comply with FAA regulations
governing production and quality systems, airworthiness and installation approvals, repair procedures and continuing
operational safety. Outside the U.S., similar requirements exist for airworthiness, installation and operational approvals.
These requirements are generally administered by the national aviation authorities of each country and, in the case of
Europe, coordinated by the European Joint Aviation Authorities.
Environmental. We are subject to various federal, state, local and non-U.S. laws and regulations relating to
environmental protection, including the discharge, treatment, storage, disposal and remediation of hazardous
substances and wastes. We continually assess our compliance status and management of environmental matters to
ensure our operations are in compliance with all applicable environmental laws and regulations. Investigation,
remediation, and operation and maintenance costs associated with environmental compliance and management of
sites are a normal, recurring part of our operations. These costs often are allowable costs under our contracts with the
U.S. government. It is reasonably possible that costs incurred to ensure continued environmental compliance could
have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows if additional work requirements or
more stringent clean-up standards are imposed by regulators, new areas of soil, air and groundwater contamination are
discovered and/or expansions of work scope are prompted by the results of investigations.
A Potentially Responsible Party (PRP) has joint and several liability under existing U.S. environmental laws. Where we
have been designated a PRP by the Environmental Protection Agency or a state environmental agency, we are
potentially liable to the government or third parties for the full cost of remediating contamination at our facilities or
former facilities or at third-party sites. If we were required to fully fund the remediation of a site for which we were
originally assigned a partial share, the statutory
3
Table of Contents
framework would allow us to pursue rights to contribution from other PRPs. For additional information relating to
environmental contingencies, see Note 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
Non-U.S. Sales. Our non-U.S. sales are subject to both U.S. and non-U.S. governmental regulations and procurement
policies and practices, including regulations relating to import-export control, tariffs, investment, exchange controls,
anti-corruption, and repatriation of earnings. Non-U.S. sales are also subject to varying currency, political and economic
risks.
Raw Materials, Parts, and Subassemblies
We are highly dependent on the availability of essential materials, parts and subassemblies from our suppliers and
subcontractors. The most important raw materials required for our aerospace products are aluminum (sheet, plate,
forgings and extrusions), titanium (sheet, plate, forgings and extrusions) and composites (including carbon and boron).
Although alternative sources generally exist for these raw materials, qualification of the sources could take a year or
more. Many major components and product equipment items are procured or subcontracted on a sole-source basis
with a number of companies.
Suppliers
We are dependent upon the ability of a large number of U.S. and non-U.S. suppliers and subcontractors to meet
performance specifications, quality standards and delivery schedules at our anticipated costs. While we maintain an
extensive qualification and performance surveillance system to control risk associated with such reliance on third
parties, failure of suppliers or subcontractors to meet commitments could adversely affect production schedules and
program/contract profitability, thereby jeopardizing our ability to fulfill commitments to our customers. We are also
dependent on the availability of energy sources, such as electricity, at affordable prices.
Seasonality
No material portion of our business is considered to be seasonal.

Forward-Looking Statements
This report, as well as our annual report to shareholders, quarterly reports, and other filings we make with the SEC,
press and earnings releases and other written and oral communications, contain “forward-looking statements” within
the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Words such as “may,” “should,” “expects,”
“intends,” “projects,” “plans,” “believes,” “estimates,” “targets,” “anticipates” and similar expressions generally identify
these forward-looking statements. Examples of forward-looking statements include statements relating to our future
financial condition and operating results, as well as any other statement that does not directly relate to any historical or
current fact.
Forward-looking statements are based on expectations and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable when made,
but that may not prove to be accurate. These statements are not guarantees and are subject to risks, uncertainties and
changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict. Many factors, including those set forth in the “Risk Factors”
section below and other important factors disclosed in this report and from time to time in our other filings with the SEC,
could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from these forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking
statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made, and we assume no obligation to update or revise any
forward-looking statement whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by
law.
Item 1A. Risk Factors
An investment in our common stock or debt securities involves risks and uncertainties and our actual results and future
trends may differ materially from our past or projected future performance. We urge investors to consider carefully the
risk factors described below in evaluating the information contained in this report.
Our Commercial Airplanes and Global Services businesses depend heavily on commercial airlines, and are
subject to unique risks.
Market conditions have a significant impact on demand for our commercial aircraft and related services. The
commercial aircraft market is predominantly driven by long-term trends in airline passenger and cargo traffic. The
principal factors underlying long-term traffic growth are sustained economic growth and political stability both in
developed and emerging markets. Demand for our commercial aircraft is further influenced by airline profitability,
availability of aircraft financing, world trade policies, government-to-government relations, technological advances, price
and other competitive factors, fuel prices, terrorism, epidemics and environmental regulations. Traditionally, the airline
industry has been cyclical and very competitive and has experienced significant profit swings and constant challenges
to be more cost competitive. In addition, availability of financing to non-U.S. customers depends in part on the Export-
Import Bank of the United States being fully operational. Significant deterioration in the global economic environment,
the airline industry generally, or the financial stability of one or more of our major customers could result in fewer new
orders for aircraft or services, or could cause customers to seek to postpone or cancel contractual orders and/or
payments to us, which could result in lower revenues, profitability and cash flows and a reduction in our contractual
backlog. In addition, because our commercial aircraft backlog consists of aircraft scheduled for delivery over a period of
several years, any of these macroeconomic, industry or customer impacts could unexpectedly affect deliveries over a
long period.
We enter into firm fixed-price aircraft sales contracts with indexed price escalation clauses which could subject us to
losses if we have cost overruns or if increases in our costs exceed the applicable escalation rate. Commercial aircraft
sales contracts are often entered into years before the aircraft are delivered. In order to help account for economic
fluctuations between the contract date and delivery date, aircraft pricing generally consists of a fixed amount as
modified by price escalation formulas derived from labor, commodity and other price indices. Our revenue estimates
are based on current expectations with respect to these escalation formulas, but the actual escalation amounts are
outside of our control. Escalation factors can
5
Table of Contents
fluctuate significantly from period to period. Changes in escalation amounts can significantly impact revenues and
operating margins in our Commercial Airplanes business.
We derive a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of commercial airlines. We can make no
assurance that any customer will exercise purchase options, fulfill existing purchase commitments or purchase
additional products or services from us. In addition, fleet decisions, airline consolidations or financial challenges
involving any of our major commercial airline customers could significantly reduce our revenues and limit our
opportunity to generate profits from those customers.
Our Commercial Airplanes business depends on our ability to maintain a healthy production system, achieve
planned production rate targets, successfully develop new aircraft or new derivative aircraft, and meet or
exceed stringent performance and reliability standards.
The commercial aircraft business is extremely complex, involving extensive coordination and integration with U.S and
non-U.S. suppliers, highly-skilled labor from thousands of employees and other partners, and stringent regulatory
requirements and performance and reliability standards. In addition, the introduction of new aircraft programs and/or
derivatives, such as the 777X, involves increased risks associated with meeting development, testing, production and
certification schedules. As a result, our ability to deliver aircraft on time, satisfy regulatory and customer requirements,
and achieve or maintain, as applicable, program profitability is subject to significant risks.
We must minimize disruption caused by production changes and achieve productivity improvements in order to meet
customer demand and maintain our profitability. We have plans to adjust production rates on several of our commercial
aircraft programs, while at the same time engaging in significant ongoing development and production of the 777X
aircraft. In addition, we continue to seek opportunities to reduce the costs of building our aircraft, including working with
our suppliers to reduce supplier costs, identifying and implementing productivity improvements, and optimizing how we
manage inventory. If production rate changes at any of our commercial aircraft assembly facilities are delayed or create
significant disruption to our production system, or if our suppliers cannot timely deliver components to us at the cost
and rates necessary to achieve our targets, we may be unable to meet delivery schedules and/or the financial
performance of one or more of our programs may suffer.
Operational challenges impacting the production system for one or more of our commercial aircraft programs could
result in production delays and/or failure to meet customer demand for new aircraft, either of which would negatively
impact our revenues and operating margins. Our commercial aircraft production system is extremely complex.
Operational issues, including delays or defects in supplier components, failure to meet internal performance plans, or
delays or failures to achieve required regulatory certifications, could result in significant out-of-sequence work and
increased production costs, as well as delayed deliveries to customers, impacts to aircraft performance and/or
increased warranty or fleet support costs.
If our commercial airplanes fail to satisfy performance and reliability requirements, we could face additional costs
and/or lower revenues. Developing and manufacturing commercial aircraft that meet or exceed our performance and
reliability standards, as well as those of customers and regulatory agencies, can be costly and technologically
challenging. These challenges are particularly significant with newer aircraft programs. Any failure of any Boeing
aircraft to satisfy performance or reliability requirements could result in disruption to our operations, higher costs and/or
lower revenues.
Changes in levels of U.S. government defense spending or overall acquisition priorities could negatively
impact our financial position and results of operations.
We derive a substantial portion of our revenue from the U.S. government, primarily from defense related programs with
the United States Department of Defense (U.S. DoD). Levels of U.S. defense spending are very difficult to predict and
may be impacted by numerous factors such as the political environment, U.S.
6
Table of Contents
foreign policy, macroeconomic conditions and the ability of the U.S. government to enact relevant legislation such as
authorization and appropriations bills.
The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 raised preexisting spending caps for fiscal years 2018 and 2019 (FY18 and FY19).
The consolidated spending bills signed into law in September 2018 provide defense funding for FY19. However, other
departments and agencies, including the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the Federal
Aviation Administration (FAA), are being temporarily funded at FY18 levels. Failure to enact a Continuing Resolution or
FY19 appropriations by February 15, 2019 would result in a partial government shutdown affecting these departments
and agencies. Such a shutdown could impact the Company’s operations. In addition, reduced discretionary spending
limits initially enacted in 2011 would take effect again in fiscal years 2020 and 2021 (FY20 and FY21) unless Congress
acts to raise the spending caps or to repeal or suspend the law establishing the reduced limits. As a result, continued
budget uncertainty and the risk of future sequestration cuts remain and it is likely that U.S. government discretionary
spending levels will continue to be subject to pressure.
In addition, there continues to be significant uncertainty with respect to future program-level appropriations for the U.S.
DoD and other government agencies (including NASA) within the overall budgetary framework described above. While
the House and Senate Appropriations Committees included funding for Boeing’s major programs, such as F/A-18
Super Hornet, CH-47 Chinook, AH-64 Apache, V-22 Osprey, KC-46A Pegasus Tanker and P-8 Poseidon, in their final
FY19 defense appropriations, uncertainty remains about how defense budgets in FY20 and beyond will affect Boeing’s
programs. Future budget cuts or investment priority changes, including changes associated with the authorizations and
appropriations process could result in reductions, cancellations, and/or delays of existing contracts or programs. Any of
these impacts could have a material effect on the results of the Company’s operations, financial position and/or cash
flows.
In addition, as a result of the significant ongoing uncertainty with respect to both U.S. defense spending levels and the
nature of the threat environment, we expect the U.S. DoD to continue to emphasize cost-cutting and other efficiency
initiatives in its procurement processes. If we can no longer adjust successfully to these changing acquisition priorities
and/or fail to meet affordability targets set by the U.S. DoD customer, our revenues and market share would be further
impacted.
We conduct a significant portion of our business pursuant to U.S. government contracts, which are subject to
unique risks.
In 2018, 31% of our revenues were earned pursuant to U.S. government contracts, which include foreign military sales
(FMS) through the U.S. government. Business conducted pursuant to such contracts is subject to extensive
procurement regulations and other unique risks.
Our sales to the U.S. government are subject to extensive procurement regulations, and changes to those regulations
could increase our costs. New procurement regulations, or changes to existing requirements, could increase our
compliance costs or otherwise have a material impact on the operating margins of our BDS and BGS businesses.
These requirements may result in increased compliance costs, and we could be subject to additional costs in the form
of withheld payments and/or reduced future business if we fail to comply with these requirements in the future.
Compliance costs attributable to current and potential future procurement regulations such as these could negatively
impact our financial condition and operating results.
The U.S. government may modify, curtail or terminate one or more of our contracts. The U.S. government contracting
party may modify, curtail or terminate its contracts and subcontracts with us, without prior notice and either at its
convenience or for default based on performance. In addition, funding pursuant to our U.S. government contracts may
be reduced or withheld as part of the U.S. Congressional appropriations process due to fiscal constraints, changes in
U.S. national security strategy and/or priorities or other
7
Table of Contents
reasons. Further uncertainty with respect to ongoing programs could also result in the event that the U.S. government
finances its operations through temporary funding measures such as “continuing resolutions” rather than full-year
appropriations. Any loss or anticipated loss or reduction of expected funding and/or modification, curtailment, or
termination of one or more large programs could have a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flow and/or
financial position.
We are subject to U.S. government inquiries and investigations, including periodic audits of costs that we determine are
reimbursable under U.S. government contracts. U.S. government agencies, including the Defense Contract Audit
Agency and the Defense Contract Management Agency, routinely audit government contractors. These agencies
review our performance under contracts, cost structure and compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and
standards, as well as the adequacy of and our compliance with our internal control systems and policies. Any costs
found to be misclassified or inaccurately allocated to a specific contract will be deemed non-reimbursable, and to the
extent already reimbursed, must be refunded. Any inadequacies in our systems and policies could result in withholds
on billed receivables, penalties and reduced future business. Furthermore, if any audit, inquiry or investigation uncovers
improper or illegal activities, we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including
termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines, and suspension or debarment from doing
business with the U.S. government. We also could suffer reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made
against us, even if such allegations are later determined to be false.
We enter into fixed-price contracts which could subject us to losses if we have cost overruns.
Our BDS and BGS defense businesses generated approximately 65% and 77% of their 2018 revenues from fixed-price
contracts. While fixed-price contracts enable us to benefit from performance improvements, cost reductions and
efficiencies, they also subject us to the risk of reduced margins or incurring losses if we are unable to achieve
estimated costs and revenues. If our estimated costs exceed our estimated price, we recognize reach-forward losses
which can significantly affect our reported results. For example, during 2018, we recorded reach-forward losses totaling
$736 million on the USAF KC-46A Tanker contract primarily reflecting higher estimated costs associated with
certification, testing and change incorporation on aircraft, as well as higher than expected effort to meet customer
requirements in order to support delivery of the initial aircraft. In addition, in 2018, in connection with winning the T-X
and MQ-25 Stingray competitions, we recorded a loss of $400 million associated with options for 346 T-X Trainer
aircraft and a loss of $291 million related to the MQ-25 Stingray Engineering, Manufacturing and Development (EMD)
contract. The long term nature of many of our contracts makes the process of estimating costs and revenues on fixed-
price contracts inherently risky. Fixed-price contracts often contain price incentives and penalties tied to performance
which can be difficult to estimate and have significant impacts on margins. In addition, some of our contracts have
specific provisions relating to cost, schedule and performance.
Fixed-price development contracts are generally subject to more uncertainty than fixed-price production contracts.
Many of these development programs have highly complex designs. In addition, technical or quality issues that arise
during development could lead to schedule delays and higher costs to complete, which could result in a material charge
or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition. Examples of significant BDS fixed-price development contracts
include Commercial Crew, Saudi F-15, USAF KC-46A Tanker, T-X Trainer, VC-25B Presidential Aircraft, MQ-25
Stingray, and commercial and military satellites.
We enter into cost-type contracts which also carry risks.
Our BDS and BGS defense businesses generated approximately 35% and 23% of their 2018 revenues from cost-type
contracting arrangements. Some of these are development programs that have complex design and technical
challenges. These cost-type programs typically have award or incentive fees that are subject to uncertainty and may be
earned over extended periods. In these cases the associated financial risks are primarily in reduced fees, lower profit
rates or program cancellation if cost, schedule or technical
8

performance issues arise. Programs whose contracts are primarily cost-type include GMD, Proprietary and SLS
programs.
We enter into contracts that include in-orbit incentive payments that subject us to risks.
Contracts in the commercial satellite industry and certain government satellite contracts include in-orbit incentive
payments. These in-orbit payments may be paid over time after final satellite acceptance or paid in full prior to final
satellite acceptance. In both cases, the in-orbit incentive payment is at risk if the satellite does not perform to
specifications for up to 15 years after acceptance. The net present value of in-orbit incentive fees we ultimately expect
to realize is recognized as revenue in the construction period. If the satellite fails to meet contractual performance
criteria, customers will not be obligated to continue making in-orbit payments and/or we may be required to provide
refunds to the customer and incur significant charges.
Our ability to deliver products and services that satisfy customer requirements is heavily dependent on the
performance and financial stability of our subcontractors and suppliers, as well as on the availability of raw
materials and other components.
We rely on other companies including U.S. and non-U.S. subcontractors and suppliers to provide and produce raw
materials, integrated components and sub-assemblies, and production commodities and to perform some of the
services that we provide to our customers. If one or more of our suppliers or subcontractors experiences financial
difficulties, delivery delays or other performance problems, we may be unable to meet commitments to our customers
or incur additional costs. For example, the 737 program experienced supply chain disruptions in 2018 that impacted the
timing of certain deliveries during the year. In addition, if one or more of the raw materials on which we depend (such as
aluminum, titanium or composites) becomes unavailable or is available only at very high prices, we may be unable to
deliver one or more of our products in a timely fashion or at budgeted costs. In some instances, we depend upon a
single source of supply. Any service disruption from one of these suppliers, either due to circumstances beyond the
supplier’s control, such as geo-political developments, or as a result of performance problems or financial difficulties,
could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet commitments to our customers or increase our operating
costs.
We use estimates in accounting for many contracts and programs. Changes in our estimates could adversely
affect our future financial results.
Contract and program accounting require judgment relative to assessing risks, estimating revenues and costs and
making assumptions for schedule and technical issues. Due to the size and nature of many of our contracts and
programs, the estimation of total revenues and cost at completion is complicated and subject to many variables.
Assumptions have to be made regarding the length of time to complete the contract or program because costs also
include expected increases in wages and employee benefits, material prices and allocated fixed costs. Incentives or
penalties related to performance on contracts are considered in estimating sales and profit rates, and are recorded
when there is sufficient information for us to assess anticipated performance. Suppliers’ assertions are also assessed
and considered in estimating costs and profit rates. Estimates of award fees are also used in sales and profit rates
based on actual and anticipated awards.
With respect to each of our commercial aircraft programs, inventoriable production costs (including overhead), program
tooling and other non-recurring costs and routine warranty costs are accumulated and charged as cost of sales by
program instead of by individual units or contracts. A program consists of the estimated number of units (accounting
quantity) of a product to be produced in a continuing, long-term production effort for delivery under existing and
anticipated contracts limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates. To establish the relationship of
sales to cost of sales, program
9
Table of Contents
accounting requires estimates of (a) the number of units to be produced and sold in a program, (b) the period over
which the units can reasonably be expected to be produced and (c) the units’ expected sales prices, production costs,
program tooling and other non-recurring costs, and routine warranty costs for the total program. Several factors
determine accounting quantity, including firm orders, letters of intent from prospective customers and market studies.
Changes to customer or model mix, production costs and rates, learning curve, changes to price escalation indices,
costs of derivative aircraft, supplier performance, customer and supplier negotiations/settlements, supplier claims
and/or certification issues can impact these estimates. Any such change in estimates relating to program accounting
may adversely affect future financial performance.
Because of the significance of the judgments and estimation processes described above, materially different sales and
profit amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change.
Changes in underlying assumptions, circumstances or estimates may adversely affect future period financial
performance. For additional information on our accounting policies for recognizing sales and profits, see our discussion
under “Management’s Discussion and Analysis – Critical Accounting Policies – Contract Accounting/Program
Accounting” on pages 43 – 44 and Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 54 – 66 of this Form 10-
K.
Competition within our markets and with respect to the products we sell may reduce our future contracts and
sales.
The markets in which we operate are highly competitive and one or more of our competitors may have more extensive
or more specialized engineering, manufacturing and marketing capabilities than we do in some areas. In our
Commercial Airplanes business, we anticipate increasing competition among non-U.S. aircraft manufacturers of
commercial jet aircraft. In our BDS business, we anticipate that the effects of defense industry consolidation, fewer
large and new programs and new priorities, including near and long-term cost competitiveness, of our U.S. DoD and
non-U.S. customers will intensify competition for many of our BDS products. Our BGS segment faces competition from
many of the same strong U.S. and non-U.S. competitors facing BCA and BDS. Furthermore, we are facing increased
international competition and cross-border consolidation of competition. There can be no assurance that we will be able
to compete successfully against our current or future competitors or that the competitive pressures we face will not
result in reduced revenues and market share.
We derive a significant portion of our revenues from non-U.S. sales and are subject to the risks of doing
business in other countries.
In 2018, non-U.S. customers, which includes FMS, accounted for approximately 56% of our revenues. We expect that
non-U.S. sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future. As a result,
we are subject to risks of doing business internationally, including:
• changes in regulatory requirements;
• U.S. and non-U.S. government policies, including requirements to expend a portion of program funds locally
and governmental industrial cooperation or participation requirements;
• fluctuations in international currency exchange rates;
• volatility in international political and economic environments and changes in non-U.S. national priorities and
budgets, which can lead to delays or fluctuations in orders;
• the complexity and necessity of using non-U.S. representatives and consultants;
• the uncertainty of the ability of non-U.S. customers to finance purchases, including the availability of financing
from the Export-Import Bank of the United States;
• uncertainties and restrictions concerning the availability of funding credit or guarantees;
10
Table of Contents
• imposition of domestic and international taxes, export controls, tariffs, embargoes, sanctions and other trade
restrictions;
• the difficulty of management and operation of an enterprise spread over many countries;
• compliance with a variety of non-U.S. laws, as well as U.S. laws affecting the activities of U.S. companies
abroad; and
• unforeseen developments and conditions, including terrorism, war, epidemics and international tensions and
conflicts.
While the impact of these factors is difficult to predict, any one or more of these factors could adversely affect our
operations in the future.
Unauthorized access to our or our customers’ information and systems could negatively impact our business.
We face certain security threats, including threats to the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data and
systems. We maintain an extensive network of technical security controls, policy enforcement mechanisms, monitoring
systems and management oversight in order to address these threats. While these measures are designed to prevent,
detect and respond to unauthorized activity in our systems, certain types of attacks, including cyber-attacks, could
result in significant financial or information losses and/or reputational harm. In addition, we manage information and
information technology systems for certain customers. Many of these customers face similar security threats. If we
cannot prevent the unauthorized access, release and/or corruption of our customers’ confidential, classified or
personally identifiable information, our reputation could be damaged, and/or we could face financial losses.
The outcome of litigation and of government inquiries and investigations involving our business is
unpredictable and an adverse decision in any such matter could have a material effect on our financial
position and results of operations.
We are involved in a number of litigation matters. These matters may divert financial and management resources that
would otherwise be used to benefit our operations. No assurances can be given that the results of these matters will be
favorable to us. An adverse resolution of any of these lawsuits, or future lawsuits, could have a material impact on our
financial position and results of operations. In addition, we are subject to extensive regulation under the laws of the
United States and its various states, as well as other jurisdictions in which we operate. As a result, we are sometimes
subject to government inquiries and investigations of our business due, among other things, to our business
relationships with the U.S. government, the heavily regulated nature of our industry, and in the case of environmental
proceedings, our current or past ownership of certain property. Any such inquiry or investigation could potentially result
in an adverse ruling against us, which could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations.
A significant portion of our customer financing portfolio is concentrated among certain customers and in
certain types of Boeing aircraft, which exposes us to concentration risks.
A significant portion of our customer financing portfolio is concentrated among certain customers and in distinct
geographic regions. Our portfolio is also concentrated by varying degrees across Boeing aircraft product types, most
notably 717 and 747-8 aircraft, and among customers that we believe have less than investment-grade credit. If one or
more customers holding a significant portion of our portfolio assets experiences financial difficulties or otherwise
defaults on or does not renew its leases with us at their expiration, and we are unable to redeploy the aircraft on
reasonable terms, or if the types of aircraft that are concentrated in our portfolio suffer greater than expected declines
in value, our earnings, cash flows and/or financial position could be materially adversely affected.

We may be unable to obtain debt to fund our operations and contractual commitments at competitive rates, on
commercially reasonable terms or in sufficient amounts.
We depend, in part, upon the issuance of debt to fund our operations and contractual commitments. As of December
31, 2018 and 2017, our airplane financing commitments totaled $19,462 million and $10,221 million. If we require
additional funding in order to fund outstanding financing commitments or meet other business requirements, our market
liquidity may not be sufficient. A number of factors could cause us to incur increased borrowing costs and to have
greater difficulty accessing public and private markets for debt. These factors include disruptions or declines in the
global capital markets and/or a decline in our financial performance, outlook or credit ratings. The occurrence of any or
all of these events may adversely affect our ability to fund our operations and contractual or financing commitments.
We may not realize the anticipated benefits of mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures/strategic alliances or
divestitures.
As part of our business strategy, we may merge with or acquire businesses and/or form joint ventures and strategic
alliances. For example, in 2018 we completed the acquisition of KLX Inc., a provider of aviation parts and services.
Whether we realize the anticipated benefits from these acquisitions and related activities depends, in part, upon our
ability to integrate the operations of the acquired business, the performance of the underlying product and service
portfolio, and the performance of the management team and other personnel of the acquired operations. Accordingly,
our financial results could be adversely affected by unanticipated performance issues, legacy liabilities, transaction-
related charges, amortization of expenses related to intangibles, charges for impairment of long-term assets, credit
guarantees, partner performance and indemnifications. Consolidations of joint ventures could also impact our reported
results of operations or financial position. While we believe that we have established appropriate and adequate
procedures and processes to mitigate these risks, there is no assurance that these transactions will be successful. We
also may make strategic divestitures from time to time. These transactions may result in continued financial
involvement in the divested businesses, such as through guarantees or other financial arrangements, following the
transaction. Nonperformance by those divested businesses could affect our future financial results through additional
payment obligations, higher costs or asset write-downs.
Our insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all significant risk exposures.
We are exposed to liabilities that are unique to the products and services we provide. We maintain insurance for certain
risks and, in some circumstances, we may receive indemnification from the U.S. government. The amount of our
insurance coverage may not cover all claims or liabilities and we may be forced to bear substantial costs. For example,
liabilities arising from the use of certain of our products, such as aircraft technologies, missile systems, border security
systems, anti-terrorism technologies, and/or air traffic management systems may not be insurable on commercially
reasonable terms. While some of these products are shielded from liability within the U.S. under the SAFETY Act
provisions of the 2002 Homeland Security Act, no such protection is available outside the U.S., potentially resulting in
significant liabilities. The amount of insurance coverage we maintain may be inadequate to cover these or other claims
or liabilities.
Business disruptions could seriously affect our future sales and financial condition or increase our costs and
expenses.
Our business may be impacted by disruptions including threats to physical security, information technology or cyber-
attacks or failures, damaging weather or other acts of nature and pandemics or other public health crises. Any of these
disruptions could affect our internal operations or our ability to deliver products and services to our customers. Any
significant production delays, or any destruction, manipulation or improper
12
Table of Contents
use of our data, information systems or networks could impact our sales, increase our expenses and/or have an
adverse effect on the reputation of Boeing and of our products and services.
Some of our and our suppliers’ workforces are represented by labor unions, which may lead to work
stoppages.
Approximately 54,000 employees, which constitute 35% of our total workforce, were union represented as of December
31, 2018. We experienced a work stoppage in 2008 when a labor strike halted commercial aircraft and certain BDS
program production. We may experience additional work stoppages in the future, which could adversely affect our
business. We cannot predict how stable our relationships, currently with 11 U.S. labor organizations and 13 non-U.S.
labor organizations, will be or whether we will be able to meet the unions’ requirements without impacting our financial
condition. The unions may also limit our flexibility in dealing with our workforce. Union actions at suppliers can also
affect us. Work stoppages and instability in our union relationships could delay the production and/or development of
our products, which could strain relationships with customers and cause a loss of revenues which would adversely
affect our operations.
Substantial pension and other postretirement benefit obligations have a material impact on our earnings,
shareholders’ equity and cash flows from operations, and could have significant adverse impacts in future
periods.
The majority of our employees have earned benefits under defined benefit pension plans. Potential pension
contributions include both mandatory amounts required under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act and
discretionary contributions to improve the plans' funded status. The extent of future contributions depends heavily on
market factors such as the discount rate and the actual return on plan assets. We estimate future contributions to these
plans using assumptions with respect to these and other items. Changes to those assumptions could have a significant
effect on future contributions as well as on our annual pension costs and/or result in a significant change to
shareholders' equity. For U.S. government contracts, we allocate pension costs to individual contracts based on U.S.
Cost Accounting Standards which can also affect contract profitability. We also provide other postretirement benefits to
certain of our employees, consisting principally of health care coverage for eligible retirees and qualifying dependents.
Our estimates of future costs associated with these benefits are also subject to assumptions, including estimates of the
level of medical cost increases. For a discussion regarding how our financial statements can be affected by pension
and other postretirement plan accounting policies, see “Management's Discussion and Analysis-Critical Accounting
Policies-Pension Plans” on page 45 of this Form 10-K. Although Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the
United States of America (GAAP) expense and pension or other postretirement benefit contributions are not directly
related, the key economic factors that affect GAAP expense would also likely affect the amount of cash or stock we
would contribute to our plans.

Our operations expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities.
We are subject to various U.S. federal, state, local and non-U.S. laws and regulations related to environmental
protection, including the discharge, treatment, storage, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and wastes.
We could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, as well as third-party
claims for property damage or personal injury, if we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws or
regulations. In some cases, we may be subject to such costs due to environmental impacts attributable to our current or
past manufacturing operations or the operations of companies we have acquired. In other cases, we may become
subject to such costs due to an indemnification agreement between us and a third party relating to such environmental
liabilities. In addition, new laws and regulations, more stringent enforcement of existing laws and regulations, the
discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new remediation requirements could result in
additional costs. For additional information relating to environmental contingencies, see Note 14 to our Consolidated
Financial Statements.

Consolidated Results of Operations and Financial Condition
Overview
We are a global market leader in the design, development, manufacture, sale, service and support of commercial
jetliners, military aircraft, satellites, missile defense, human space flight and launch systems and services. We are one
of the two major manufacturers of 100+ seat airplanes for the worldwide commercial airline industry and one of the
largest defense contractors in the U.S. While our principal operations are in the U.S., we conduct operations in an
expanding number of countries and rely on an extensive network of non-U.S. partners, key suppliers and
subcontractors.
Our strategy is centered on successful execution in healthy core businesses – Commercial Airplanes (BCA), Defense,
Space & Security (BDS), and Global Services (BGS) – supplemented and supported by Boeing Capital (BCC). Taken
together, these core businesses have historically generated substantial earnings and cash flow that permit us to invest
in new products and services. We focus on producing the products and providing the services that the market
demands, and continue to find new ways to improve efficiency and quality to provide a fair return for our shareholders.
BCA is committed to being the leader in commercial aviation by offering airplanes and services that deliver superior
design, efficiency and value to customers around the world. BDS integrates its resources in defense, intelligence,
communications, security, space and services to deliver capability-driven solutions to customers at reduced costs. Our
BDS strategy is to leverage our core businesses to capture key next-generation programs while expanding our
presence in adjacent and international markets, underscored by an intense focus on growth and productivity. BGS
provides support for commercial and defense through innovative, comprehensive, and cost-competitive product and
service solutions. BCC facilitates, arranges, structures and provides selective financing solutions for our Boeing
customers.

Total $101,127 $94,005 $93,496
Revenues in 2018 increased by $7,122 million or 8% compared with 2017 due to higher revenues at BCA, BDS, and
BGS. BCA revenues increased by $2,701 million due to higher 737 and 787 deliveries and favorable 737 and 787
model mix, which more than offset lower 777 and 747 deliveries. BDS revenues increased by $2,634 million primarily
due to non-US contract awards for fighters, higher weapons revenue, the final C-17 aircraft sale and higher satellites
revenue. BGS revenues increased by $2,437 million due to growth across our services portfolio, primarily driven by
higher parts revenue including the acquisition of KLX Inc. (KLX). The increases at BCA, BDS, and BGS were partially
offset by lower unallocated revenue.
Revenues in 2017 increased by $509 million or 1% compared with 2016. BDS revenues increased by $381 million
primarily due to higher weapons revenue. BGS revenues increased by $762 million primarily due to higher commercial
parts revenue. The increases at BDS and BGS were partially offset by lower BCA revenues, primarily due to delivery
mix, with fewer twin aisle deliveries more than offsetting the impact of higher single aisle deliveries.
The changes in Unallocated items, eliminations and other in 2018, 2017 and 2016 primarily reflect the timing of
eliminations for intercompany aircraft deliveries and the sale of aircraft previously leased to customers.

Earnings from operations in 2018 increased by $1,643 million compared with 2017, primarily due to higher earnings at
BCA and BGS, which more than offset the decrease at BDS and the change in Unallocated items, eliminations and
other. BCA earnings from operations increased by $2,427 million in 2018 due to higher revenues and improved
operating margins. The increase in operating margins is primarily due to higher 787 margins, improved cost
performance and favorable delivery mix. BGS earnings from operations increased by $276 million in 2018 primarily due
to higher revenues, partially offset by higher period costs. BDS earnings from operations in 2018 decreased by $599
million compared with 2017 as earnings’ growth from higher revenues was more than offset by charges of $691 million
related to winning the T-X Trainer and MQ-25 competitions, as well as $199 million of higher KC-46A Tanker reach-
forward losses.
Earnings from operations in 2017 increased by $3,817 million compared with 2016 due to higher earnings at BCA and
BDS, partially offset by the change in Unallocated items, eliminations and other. BCA earnings from operations
increased by $3,471 million in 2017 primarily due to lower reach-forward losses, lower research and development
costs, and improved margins reflecting favorable cost performance. In 2016, BCA recorded reach-forward losses of
$1,258 million on the 747 program and reclassified $1,235 million of 787 flight test aircraft inventory costs to research
and development. The reclassification of flight test aircraft costs was recorded in the second quarter of 2016 as a result
of our determination that two 787 flight test aircraft were no longer commercially saleable. BDS earnings from
operations increased by $515 million in 2017 primarily due to lower charges on the KC-46A Tanker and Commercial
Crew programs.
During 2018, 2017 and 2016, we recorded reach-forward losses on the KC-46A Tanker program. In 2018, we recorded
charges of $736 million, of which $500 million was recorded at BCA, $222 million at BDS, and $14 million at BGS.
During 2017, we recorded charges of $445 million: $378 million at BCA, $44 million at BGS, and $23 million at BDS.
During 2016, we recorded charges of $1,127 million: $772 million at BCA and $351 million at BDS.
Core operating earnings for 2018 increased by $1,754 million compared with 2017 primarily due to higher earnings at
BCA and BGS, partially offset by lower earnings at BDS and higher unallocated expenses.

Unallocated Items, Eliminations and Other The most significant items included in Unallocated items, eliminations
and other are shown in the following table:
(Dollars in millions)   
Years ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016
Share-based plans ($76) ($77) ($66)
Deferred compensation (19) (240) (46)
Eliminations and other unallocated items (1,319) (782) (595)
Unallocated items, eliminations and other ($1,414) ($1,099) ($707)
Deferred compensation expense decreased by $221 million in 2018 and increased by $194 million in 2017, primarily
driven by changes in broad stock market conditions and our stock price.
Eliminations and other unallocated expense increased by $537 million in 2018 primarily due to timing of expense
allocations, higher research and development expense and a $148 million charge incurred related to the outcome of
the Spirit litigation. See the discussion in Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
Eliminations and other unallocated expense increased by $187 million in 2017 primarily due to the timing of expense
allocations.
A portion of service cost is recognized in Earnings from operations in the period incurred and the remainder is included
in inventory at the end of the reporting period and recorded in Earnings from operations in subsequent periods.
Net periodic pension benefit costs included in Earnings from operations were as follows:
(Dollars in millions) Pension
Years ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016
Allocated to business segments ($1,318)($1,637) ($2,286)
Pension FAS/CAS service cost adjustment 1,005 1,127 1,029
Net periodic benefit cost included in Earnings from operations ($313) ($510) ($1,257)
The pension FAS/CAS service cost adjustment recognized in earnings in 2018, 2017, and 2016 were largely consistent
across all periods. The decrease in net periodic benefit costs included in Earnings from operations in 2017 was
primarily due to lower service costs reflecting the transition of employees in 2016 to defined contribution retirement
savings plans.

Net earnings from continuing operations $10,460 $8,458 $5,034
Other income/(loss), net decreased by $31 million in 2018 primarily due to lower gains from foreign exchange, partially
offset by higher interest income. Other income/(loss), net increased by $561 million in 2017 primarily due to a decrease
in non-operating pension and postretirement costs and higher gains from foreign exchange. The non-operating pension
expense included in Other income/(loss), net was a benefit of $143 million in 2018 and $117 million in 2017, compared
with an expense of $327 million in 2016. The benefits in 2018 and 2017 reflect expected returns in excess of interest
cost and amortization of actuarial losses. The expense in 2016 reflects the amortization of non-service costs previously
capitalized as inventory in prior years, primarily interest cost and amortization of actuarial losses in excess of expected
returns.
Interest and debt expense increased by $115 million in 2018 as a result of higher debt balances and lower capitalized
interest and increased by $54 million in 2017 as a result of lower capitalized interest.
For additional discussion related to Income Taxes, see Note 6 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
Total Costs and Expenses (“Cost of Sales”)
Cost of sales, for both products and services, consists primarily of raw materials, parts, sub-assemblies, labor,
overhead and subcontracting costs. Our BCA segment predominantly uses program accounting to account for cost of
sales. Under program accounting, cost of sales for each commercial airplane program equals the product of (i) revenue
recognized in connection with customer deliveries and (ii) the estimated cost of sales percentage applicable to the total
remaining program. For long-term contracts, the amount reported as cost of sales is recognized as incurred.
Substantially all contracts at our BDS segment, certain military derivative aircraft contracts at BCA and certain contracts
at our BGS segment are long-term contracts with the U.S. government and other customers that generally extend over
several years. Costs on these contracts are recorded as incurred.
The following table summarizes cost of sales:
(Dollars in millions)    
Years ended December

Cost of sales $81,490 $76,612 $4,878  $76,612 $79,026 ($2,414)
Cost of sales as a % of
revenues 80.6% 81.5% (0.9%) 81.5% 84.5% (3.0)%
Cost of sales in 2018 increased by $4,878 million, or 6%, compared with 2017, primarily due to higher revenue and
higher reach-forward losses at BCA and BDS.
Cost of sales in 2017 decreased by $2,414 million, or 3%, compared with 2016, primarily due to lower reach-forward
losses at BCA and BDS.

Total $3,269 $3,179 $4,626
Research and development expense in 2018 increased by $90 million compared with 2017 due to investment in
product development, partially offset by lower spending on 777X and 787-10.
Research and development expense in 2017 decreased by $1,447 million compared with 2016 primarily due to the
reclassification of $1,235 million of costs from inventory in the second quarter of 2016 related to the fourth and fifth 787
flight test aircraft as well as lower spending on the 737 MAX, 787-10, and 777X.
Backlog
Our backlog at December 31 was as follows:
(Dollars in millions)  
Years ended December 31, 2018 2017
Commercial Airplanes $412,307 $410,986
Defense, Space & Security 57,166 44,049

Contractual backlog 462,070 456,984
Unobligated backlog 28,411 $17,656
Total Backlog $490,481 $474,640
Contractual backlog of unfilled orders excludes purchase options, announced orders for which definitive contracts have
not been executed, and unobligated U.S. and non-U.S. government contract funding. The increase in contractual
backlog during 2018 was primarily due to BDS orders and funding for contract awards in excess of revenue recognized.
Unobligated backlog includes U.S. and non-U.S. government definitive contracts for which funding has not been
authorized. The increase in unobligated backlog in 2018 was primarily due to contract awards, partially offset by
reclassifications to contractual backlog related to BDS and BGS contracts.
Additional Considerations
KC-46A Tanker In 2011, we were awarded a contract from the U.S. Air Force (USAF) to design, develop, manufacture
and deliver four next generation aerial refueling tankers. The KC-46A Tanker is a derivative of our 767 commercial
aircraft. This Engineering, Manufacturing and Development (EMD) contract is a fixed-price incentive fee contract valued
at $4.9 billion and involves highly complex designs and systems integration. In 2016, following our achievement of key
flight testing milestones, the USAF authorized two LRIP lots for 7 and 12 aircraft valued at $2.8 billion, and in 2017, the
USAF authorized an additional LRIP lot for 15 aircraft valued at $2.1 billion. On September 10, 2018, the USAF
authorized an additional LRIP lot for 18 aircraft valued at $2.9 billion. The contract contains production options for both
LRIP aircraft and
23
Table of Contents
full rate production aircraft. If all options under the contract are exercised, we expect to deliver 179 aircraft for a total
expected contract value of approximately $30 billion. In January 2019, we delivered the first KC-46A Tanker to the
USAF.
During 2016, we recorded reach-forward losses of $1,127 million related to the EMD contract and LRIP aircraft. During
2017, we recorded reach-forward losses of $445 million related to this program, primarily reflecting higher estimated
costs associated with certification and incorporating changes into LRIP aircraft. During 2018, we recorded additional
reach-forward losses of $736 million primarily reflecting higher estimated costs associated with certification, flight
testing and change incorporation on aircraft, as well as higher than expected effort to meet customer requirements in
order to support delivery of the initial aircraft. As with any development program, this program remains subject to
additional reach-forward losses and/or delivery delays if we experience further production, technical or quality issues,
and delays in flight testing, certification and/or delivery.
Export-Import Bank of the United States Many of our non-U.S. customers finance purchases through the Export-
Import Bank of the United States. Following the expiration of the bank’s charter on June 30, 2015, the bank’s charter
was reauthorized in December 2015. The bank is now authorized through September 30, 2019. However, until the U.S.
Senate confirms members sufficient to reconstitute a quorum of the bank’s board of directors, the bank will not be able
to approve any transaction totaling more than $10 million. As a result, we may fund additional commitments and/or
enter into new financing arrangements with customers. Certain of our non-U.S. customers also may seek to delay
purchases if they cannot obtain financing at reasonable costs, and there may be further impacts with respect to future
sales campaigns involving non-U.S. customers. We continue to work with our customers to mitigate risks associated
with the lack of a quorum of the bank’s board of directors and assist with alternative third party financing sources.
Global Trade On June 1, 2018, the U.S. Government began imposing tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. In
response to these tariffs, several major U.S. trading partners have imposed, or announced their intention to impose,
tariffs on U.S. goods. We continue to monitor the potential for any extra costs that may result from these actions.
On July 6, 2018, the U.S. and China began imposing tariffs on approximately $34 billion of each other's exports.
Certain aircraft parts and components that Boeing procures are subject to these tariffs. Subsequently, the U.S. imposed
tariffs on an additional $216 billion in Chinese goods, and China imposed tariffs on an additional $76 billion worth of
U.S goods. On December 1, 2018, the U.S. and China agreed to a 90-day timetable to negotiate a resolution to the
trade dispute. We continue to monitor the potential for any disruption and adverse revenue and/or cost impacts that
may result from these actions or future geopolitical economic developments.
The U.S. Government continues to impose and/or threaten to impose sanctions on certain businesses and individuals
in Russia. Although our operations or sales in Russia have not been impacted to date, we continue to monitor
additional sanctions that may be imposed by the U.S. Government and any responses from Russia that could affect our
supply chain, business partners or customers.

Segment Results of Operations and Financial Condition
Commercial Airplanes
Business Environment and Trends
Airline Industry Environment Global economic growth, a primary driver for air travel, was above the long-term
average of approximately 3% in 2018. Passenger traffic is estimated to grow by 6.5% in 2018, exceeding the long-term
average of approximately 5%. While growth was strong across all major world regions, there continues to be variation
between regions and airline business models. Airlines operating in Asia Pacific, Europe and North America, as well as
low-cost-carriers globally, are currently leading the growth in passenger traffic. Air cargo traffic growth is expected to be
between 4.0% and 4.5% in 2018, around the long-term average.
Airline financial performance also plays a role in the demand for new capacity. Airlines continue to focus on increasing
revenue through alliances, partnerships, new marketing initiatives, and effective leveraging of ancillary services and
related revenues. Airlines are also focusing on reducing costs and renewing fleets to leverage more efficient airplanes.
Net profits in 2018 are expected to approximate $32 billion.
The long-term outlook for the industry continues to remain positive due to the fundamental drivers of air travel demand:
economic growth and the increasing propensity to travel due to increased trade, globalization, and improved airline
services driven by liberalization of air traffic rights between countries. Our 20-year forecast projects a long-term
average growth rate of 4.7% per year for passenger traffic and 4.2% for cargo traffic. Based on long-term global
economic growth projections of 2.8% average annual GDP growth, we project a $6.3 trillion market for approximately
42,700 new airplanes over the next 20 years. The industry remains vulnerable to exogenous developments including
fuel price spikes, credit market shocks, acts of terrorism, natural disasters, conflicts, epidemics and increased global
environmental regulations.
Industry Competitiveness The commercial jet airplane market and the airline industry remain extremely competitive.
Market liberalization in Europe, the Middle East and Asia is enabling low-cost airlines to continue gaining market share.
These airlines are increasing the pressure on airfares. This results in continued cost pressures for all airlines and price
pressure on our products. Major productivity gains are essential to ensure a favorable market position at acceptable
profit margins.
Continued access to global markets remains vital to our ability to fully realize our sales potential and long-term
investment returns. Approximately 88% of Commercial Airplanes’ total backlog, in dollar terms, is with non-U.S. airlines.
We face aggressive international competitors who are intent on increasing their market share. They offer competitive
products and have access to most of the same customers and suppliers. With government support, Airbus has
historically invested heavily to create a family of products to compete with ours. Regional jet makers, Embraer and
Bombardier, continue to develop and market larger and increasingly more capable airplanes. During 2018, Airbus
acquired a majority share of Bombardier’s C Series (now A220) and is in the 100-150 seat transcontinental market,
while Embraer’s first E195-E2 delivered in 2018. Additionally, other competitors from Russia, China and Japan are
developing commercial jet aircraft. Some of these competitors have historically enjoyed access to government-provided
financial support, including “launch aid,” which greatly reduces the cost and commercial risks associated with airplane
development activities. This has enabled the development of airplanes without commercial viability; others to be
brought to market more quickly than otherwise possible; and many offered for sale below market-based prices. Many
competitors have continued to make improvements in efficiency, which may result in funding product development,
gaining market share and improving earnings. This market environment has resulted in intense pressures on pricing
and other competitive factors, and we expect these pressures to continue or intensify in the coming years.

Table of Contents
We are focused on improving our products and services and continuing our cost-reduction efforts, which enhances our
ability to compete. We are also focused on taking actions to ensure that Boeing is not harmed by unfair subsidization of
competitors.

BCA revenues increased by $2,701 million or 5% in 2018 compared with 2017 due to higher 737 and 787 deliveries
and favorable 737 and 787 model mix, which more than offset lower 777 and 747 deliveries. BCA revenues decreased
by $1,364 million or 2% in 2017 compared with 2016 primarily due to delivery mix, with fewer twin aisle deliveries more
than offsetting the impact of higher single aisle deliveries.

Earnings From Operations
Earnings from operations in 2018 increased by $2,427 million compared with 2017. The increase in operating earnings
reflects higher revenues and improved operating margins. The increase in operating margins is primarily due to higher
787 margins, improved cost performance and favorable delivery mix.
Earnings from operations in 2017 increased by $3,471 million compared with 2016. The increase in operating earnings
and operating margins is primarily due to lower reach-forward losses, lower research and development costs, and
improved margins reflecting favorable cost performance, which more than offset the impact of lower revenues.
Research and development expense in 2016 reflects the reclassification from inventory to research and development
expense of $1,235 million related to the fourth and fifth 787 flight test aircraft and higher planned spending related to
the 777X program.
26
Table of Contents
Reach-forward losses of $500 million, $378 million and $772 million were recorded related to the KC-46A Tanker in
2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. During 2016, we recorded reach-forward losses on the 747 program of $1,258
million.
Backlog
Our total backlog represents the estimated transaction prices on unsatisfied and partially satisfied performance
obligations to our customers where we believe it is probable that we will collect the consideration due and where no
contingencies remain before we and the customer are required to perform. Backlog does not include prospective orders
where customer controlled contingencies remain, such as the customer receiving approval from its board of directors,
shareholders or government or completing financing arrangements. All such contingencies must be satisfied or have
expired prior to recording a new firm order even if satisfying such conditions is highly certain. Backlog excludes options
and BCC orders. A number of our customers may have contractual remedies that may be implicated by program
delays. We address customer claims and requests for other contractual relief as they arise. The value of orders in
backlog is adjusted as changes to price and schedule are agreed to with customers and is reported in accordance with
the requirements of ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606).
BCA total backlog of $412,307 million at December 31, 2018 increased from $410,986 million at December 31, 2017,
primarily due to net orders in excess of deliveries.
Accounting Quantity The accounting quantity is our estimate of the quantity of airplanes that will be produced for
delivery under existing and anticipated contracts. The determination of the accounting quantity is limited by the ability to
make reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and cost of existing and anticipated contracts. It is a key
determinant of the gross margins we recognize on sales of individual airplanes throughout a program’s life. Estimation
of each program’s accounting quantity takes into account several factors that are indicative of the demand for that
program, including firm orders, letters of intent from prospective customers and market studies. We review our program
accounting quantities quarterly.
The accounting quantity for each program may include units that have been delivered, undelivered units under contract,
and units anticipated to be under contract in the reasonable future (anticipated orders). In developing total program
estimates, all of these items within the accounting quantity must be considered.

Program Highlights
737 Program The accounting quantity for the 737 program increased by 600 units during 2018 due to the program’s
normal progress of obtaining additional orders and delivering airplanes. We delivered the first 737 MAX 8 in May 2017,
announced the launch of the 737 MAX 10 in June 2017 and delivered the first 737 MAX 9 in March 2018. The
production rate increased from 47 per month to 52 per month in the second quarter of 2018, however the timing of
deliveries in 2018 was adversely affected by delays in the supply chain. We continue to plan to increase the production
rate to 57 per month in 2019.
747 Program During the fourth quarter of 2018, we received a firm order for 4 new aircraft and increased the
accounting quantity by 4 units to 1,574 aircraft. The program accounting quantity now includes aircraft scheduled to be
produced through 2022. We are currently producing at a rate of 0.5 aircraft per month having reduced the rate from 1.0
per month in September 2016. In 2016, we recorded reach-forward losses of $1,258 million as lower than expected
demand for large commercial passenger and freighter aircraft and slower than expected growth of global freight traffic
resulted in lower anticipated revenues from future sales and higher costs to produce fewer airplanes. We continue to
evaluate the viability of the 747 program. We believe that a decision to end production of the 747 at the end of the
current accounting quantity would not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash
flows.
28
Table of Contents
767 Program The accounting quantity for the 767 program increased by 24 units during the first quarter of 2018 due to
the program's normal progress of obtaining additional orders and delivering airplanes. The 767 assembly line includes
a 767 derivative to support the tanker program. We are currently producing at a rate of 2.5 per month and plan to
increase to 3 per month in 2020.
777 Program The accounting quantity for the 777 program increased by 55 units during 2018 due to the program’s
normal progress of obtaining additional orders and delivering airplanes. We are currently producing at a rate of 5 per
month. In 2013, we launched the 777X, which features a new composite wing, new engines and folding wing-tips. The
777X will have a separate program accounting quantity, which will be determined in the year of first airplane delivery,
targeted for 2020.
787 Program The accounting quantity for the 787 program increased by 200 units during 2018 due to the program’s
normal progress of obtaining additional orders and delivering airplanes. We are currently producing at a rate of 12 per
month and plan to increase to 14 per month in 2019. We delivered the first 787-10 in March 2018.
Fleet Support We provide the operators of our commercial airplanes with assistance and services to facilitate efficient
and safe airplane operation. Collectively known as fleet support services, these activities and services begin prior to
airplane delivery and continue throughout the operational life of the airplane. They include flight and maintenance
training, field service support, engineering services, information services and systems and technical data and
documents. The costs for fleet support are expensed as incurred and have historically been approximately 1.0% of total
consolidated costs of products and services.
Program Development The following chart summarizes the time horizon between go-ahead and planned initial
delivery for major Commercial Airplanes derivatives and programs.

We launched the 737 MAX 7, 8 and 9 in August 2011 and the 737 MAX 10 in June 2017. We launched the 787-10 in
June 2013 and the 777X in November 2013.
Additional Considerations
The development and ongoing production of commercial aircraft is extremely complex, involving extensive coordination
and integration with suppliers and highly-skilled labor from employees and other partners. Meeting or exceeding our
performance and reliability standards, as well as those of customers and regulators, can be costly and technologically
challenging. In addition, the introduction of new aircraft and derivatives, such as the 777X, involves increased risks
associated with meeting development, production and certification schedules. As a result, our ability to deliver aircraft
on time, satisfy performance and reliability standards and achieve or maintain, as applicable, program profitability is
subject to significant risks. Factors that could result in lower margins (or a material charge if an airplane program has or
is determined to have reach-forward losses) include the following: changes to the program accounting quantity,
customer and model mix, production costs and rates, changes to price escalation factors due to changes in the inflation
rate or other economic indicators, performance or reliability issues involving completed aircraft, capital expenditures
and other costs associated with increasing or adding new
29

production capacity, learning curve, additional change incorporation, achieving anticipated cost reductions, flight test
and certification schedules, costs, schedule and demand for new airplanes and derivatives and status of customer
claims, supplier assertions and other contractual negotiations. While we believe the cost and revenue estimates
incorporated in the consolidated financial statements are appropriate, the technical complexity of our airplane programs
creates financial risk as additional completion costs may become necessary or scheduled delivery dates could be
extended, which could trigger termination provisions, order cancellations or other financially significant exposure.

The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, passed in February 2018, raised the 2011 Budget Control Act spending caps for
fiscal years 2018 and 2019 (FY18 and FY19). The consolidated spending bills signed into law in September 2018
provide defense funding for FY19, in compliance with the revised caps. These bills also provide FY19 appropriations for
most of the federal government. Full year funding for the departments and agencies not covered by enacted FY19
appropriations, including the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA), remains uncertain. The unfunded departments and agencies affected by the partial government
shutdown (December 22, 2018 through January 25, 2019) are now covered by a Continuing Resolution that extends
funding at FY18 levels through February 15, 2019. Congress and the President must agree to FY19 appropriations or
an additional Continuing Resolution to fund affected departments and agencies beyond the February 15 deadline in
order to prevent a second partial government shutdown. The impact of a partial government shutdown to the
Company’s operations would increase as the shutdown continues. 
There continues to be uncertainty with respect to future program-level appropriations for the U.S. DoD and other
government agencies, including NASA. The 2011 Budget Control Act continues to mandate limits on U.S. government
discretionary spending for fiscal years 2020 and 2021 (FY20 and FY21). The lower budget caps will take effect again in
FY20 and FY21 unless Congress acts to raise the spending caps or to repeal or suspend the law. As a result,
continued budget uncertainty and the risk of future sequestration cuts remain. Future budget cuts or investment priority
changes could result in reductions, cancellations and/or delays of existing contracts or programs. Any of these impacts
could have a material effect on the results of the Company’s operations, financial position and/or cash flows.
 
Non-U.S. Defense Environment Overview The non-U.S. market continues to be driven by complex and evolving
security challenges and the need to modernize aging equipment and inventories. BDS expects that it will continue to
have a wide range of opportunities across Asia, Europe and the Middle East given the diverse regional threats. At the
end of 2018, 30% of BDS backlog was attributable to non-U.S. customers.

Since our operating cycle is long-term and involves many different types of development and production contracts with
varying delivery and milestone schedules, the operating results of a particular year, or year-to-year comparisons of
revenues, earnings and backlog may not be indicative of future operating results. In addition, depending on the
customer and their funding sources, our orders might be structured as annual follow-on contracts, or as one large multi-
year order or long-term award. As a result, period-to-period comparisons of backlog are not necessarily indicative of
future workloads. The following discussions of comparative results among periods should be viewed in this context.

Revenues
BDS revenues in 2018 increased by $2,634 million compared with 2017 primarily due to non-US contract awards for
fighters, higher weapons revenue, the final C-17 aircraft sale and higher satellites revenue. Net favorable cumulative
contract catch-up adjustments to revenue for 2018 were $214 million lower than the comparable period in the prior
year, reflecting increased unfavorable adjustments on the KC-46A Tanker recorded in 2018.
BDS revenues in 2017 increased by $381 million compared with 2016 primarily due to higher weapons revenue. Net
favorable cumulative contract catch-up adjustments to revenue for 2017 were $81 million higher than the comparable
period in the prior year, reflecting decreased unfavorable adjustments on the KC-46A Tanker recorded in 2017.
Earnings From Operations
BDS earnings from operations in 2018 decreased by $599 million compared with 2017 as earnings’ growth from higher
revenues was more than offset by charges of $691 million related to winning the T-X Trainer and MQ-25 competitions,
as well as $199 million of higher KC-46A Tanker reach-forward losses. Net favorable cumulative contract catch-up
adjustments to earnings for 2018 were $315 million lower than the comparable period in the prior year, driven by higher
charges on development programs in 2018.
31
Table of Contents
BDS earnings from operations in 2017 increased by $515 million compared with 2016 primarily due to lower charges on
the KC-46A Tanker and Commercial Crew programs. Higher earnings reflect the favorable impact of cumulative catch-
up adjustments which were $374 million higher in 2017 than in 2016, primarily driven by lower charges on development
programs in 2017.
BDS earnings from operations include equity earnings of $147 million, $183 million and $249 million primarily from our
ULA and non-U.S. joint ventures in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
During 2018, 2017 and 2016, BDS recorded charges related to the KC-46A Tanker contract of $222 million, $23 million
and $351 million, respectively.
Backlog
Total backlog of $57,166 million at December 31, 2018 increased by 30% from $44,049 million at December 31, 2017,
primarily due to current year contract awards in many of our programs greater than revenue recognized. Significant
orders included Satellites, F/A-18 fighters, Ground-based Midcourse Defense, weapons, VC-25B Presidential Aircraft,
V-22 Osprey, CH-47 Chinook, MQ-25 Stingray and T-X Trainer.
Additional Considerations
Our BDS business includes a variety of development programs which have complex design and technical challenges.
Many of these programs have cost-type contracting arrangements. In these cases, the associated financial risks are
primarily in reduced fees, lower profit rates or program cancellation if cost, schedule or technical performance issues
arise. Examples of these programs include Ground-based Midcourse Defense, Proprietary and Space Launch System
programs.
Some of our development programs are contracted on a fixed-price basis and BDS customers are increasingly seeking
fixed priced proposals for new programs. Examples of significant fixed-price development programs include
Commercial Crew, Saudi F-15, USAF KC-46A Tanker, T-X Trainer, VC-25B Presidential Aircraft, MQ-25 Stingray, and
commercial and military satellites. New programs could also have risk for reach-forward loss upon contract award and
during the period of contract performance. In the third quarter, we were awarded contracts to develop the T-X Trainer
aircraft with complementary devices and the MQ-25 Stingray. We recorded orders of $1,618 million and recognized
losses of $691 million associated with these contracts. Many development programs have highly complex designs. As
technical or quality issues arise during development, we may experience schedule delays and cost impacts, which
could increase our estimated cost to perform the work or reduce our estimated price, either of which could result in a
material charge or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition. These programs are ongoing, and while we
believe the cost and fee estimates incorporated in the financial statements are appropriate, the technical complexity of
these programs creates financial risk as additional completion costs may become necessary or scheduled delivery
dates could be extended, which could trigger termination provisions, the loss of satellite in-orbit incentive payments, or
other financially significant exposure. These programs have risk for reach-forward losses if our estimated costs exceed
our estimated contract revenues.

T-X Trainer In September 2018, we were selected by the U.S. Air Force to build the next generation training capability,
known as T-X. The program includes aircraft and simulators as well as support and ground equipment. The contract is
structured as an indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (IDIQ) fixed-price contract with a minimum of 206 aircraft and a
maximum of 475 aircraft. The EMD contract is a fixed-price contract valued at $813 million and includes five aircraft
and seven simulators, with a period of performance that runs through 2022. The production and support contracts are
structured as options that begin with authorization from fiscal year 2022 to 2034. In connection with winning this
competition, we recorded a reach-forward loss of $400 million associated with anticipated losses on the options for 346
aircraft that we believe are probable of being exercised. We believe that our investment in this contract positions us for
additional market opportunities for both trainer and light attack aircraft.
MQ-25 Stingray In August 2018, we were awarded an EMD contract to build the MQ-25 Stingray for the U.S. Navy.
The EMD contract is a fixed-price contract that includes development and delivery of four aircraft and test articles at a
contract price of $805 million. In connection with winning this competition, we recognized a reach-forward loss of $291
million. The period of performance runs from 2018 through 2024. The MQ-25 Stingray is the U.S. Navy’s first
operational carrier-based unmanned aircraft, and we believe that our investment in this contract positions us for long-
term leadership in autonomy and artificial intelligence technologies along with additional market opportunities.
Global Services
Business Environment and Trends
The aerospace markets we serve include parts distribution, logistics, and other inventory services; maintenance,
engineering, and upgrades; training and professional services; and information services. We expect the market to grow
by around 3.5% annually.
As the size of the worldwide commercial airline fleet continues to grow, so does demand for aftermarket services
designed to increase efficiency and extend the economic lives of airplanes. Airlines are using data analytics to plan
flight operations and predictive maintenance to improve their productivity and efficiency. Airlines continue to look for
opportunities to reduce the size and cost of their spare parts inventory, frequently outsourcing spares management to
third parties.
Government services market segments are growing on pace with related fleets, but vary based on the utilization and
age of the aircraft. The U.S. government services market is the single largest individual market, comprising over 50
percent of the government services markets served. Over the next decade, we expect U.S. growth to remain flat and
non-U.S. fleets, led by Middle East and Asia Pacific customers, to add rotorcraft and commercial derivative aircraft at
the fastest rates. We expect less than 20 percent of the worldwide fleet of military aircraft to be retired and replaced
over the next ten years, driving increased demand for services to maintain aging aircraft and enhance aircraft
capability.
BGS’ major customer, the U.S. government, remains subject to the spending limits and uncertainty described on page
30, which could restrict the execution of certain program activities and delay new programs or competitions.
Industry Competitiveness Aviation services is a competitive market with many domestic and international
competitors. This market environment has resulted in intense pressures on pricing and we expect these pressures to
continue or intensify in the coming years. Continued access to global markets remains vital to our ability to fully realize
our sales growth potential and long-term investment returns.

Revenues
BGS revenues in 2018 increased by $2,437 million compared with 2017 due to growth across our services portfolio,
primarily driven by higher parts revenue including the acquisition of KLX. Net favorable cumulative contract catch-up
adjustments to revenue were $63 million lower in 2018 than in 2017.
BGS revenues in 2017 increased by $762 million compared with 2016 primarily due to higher commercial parts
revenues. Net favorable cumulative contract catch-up adjustments to revenue were $19 million higher in 2017 than in
2016.
Earnings From Operations
BGS earnings from operations in 2018 increased by $276 million compared with 2017 primarily due to higher revenues,
partially offset by higher period costs. Net favorable cumulative contract catch-up adjustments were $25 million lower in
2018 than in 2017.
BGS earnings from operations in 2017 increased by $87 million compared with 2016 primarily due to higher revenues,
partially offset by commercial services mix. Net favorable cumulative contract catch-up adjustments were $51 million
lower in 2017 than in 2016.
Backlog
BGS total backlog of $21,008 million at December 31, 2018 increased by 7% from $19,605 million at December 31,
2017, primarily due to current year contract awards, partially offset by revenue recognized on contracts awarded in
prior years.

Boeing Capital
Business Environment and Trends
BCC’s gross customer financing and investment portfolio at December 31, 2018 totaled $2,792 million. A substantial
portion of BCC’s portfolio is related to customers that we believe have less than investment-grade credit. BCC’s
portfolio is also concentrated by varying degrees across Boeing aircraft product types, most notably 717 and 747-8
aircraft.
BCC provided customer financing of $601 million and $480 million during 2018 and 2017. While we may be required to
fund a number of new aircraft deliveries in 2019 and/or provide refinancing for existing bridge debt, we expect
alternative financing will be available at reasonable prices from broad and globally diverse sources. However, a number
of factors could cause BCC’s new business volume to increase further, including if the Export-Import Bank of the United
States continues to be unable to, or does not, approve new financing transactions.
Aircraft values and lease rates are impacted by the number and type of aircraft that are currently out of service.
Approximately 1,700 western-built commercial jet aircraft (6.7% of current world fleet) were parked at the end of 2018,
including both in-production and out-of-production aircraft types. Of these parked aircraft, approximately 2% are not
expected to return to service. At the end of 2017 and 2016, 8.3% and 8.8% of the western-built commercial jet aircraft
were parked. Aircraft valuations could decline if significant numbers of additional aircraft, particularly types with
relatively few operators, are placed out of service.

Revenues
BCC segment revenues consist principally of lease income from equipment under operating lease, interest income from
financing receivables and notes, and other income. BCC’s revenues in 2018 decreased by $33 million compared with
2017 primarily due to lower lease income driven by a smaller portfolio, partially offset by gain on sale of assets. BCC’s
revenues in 2017 were consistent with 2016.
Earnings From Operations
BCC’s earnings from operations are presented net of interest expense, provision for (recovery of) losses, asset
impairment expense, depreciation on leased equipment and other operating expenses. Earnings from operations in
2018 decreased by $35 million primarily due to lower revenues. Earnings from operations in 2017 increased by $55
million primarily due to lower asset impairment and depreciation expenses.

BCC’s customer financing and investment portfolio at December 31, 2018 decreased from December 31, 2017,
primarily due to $812 million of note payoffs, asset sales and portfolio run-off, partially offset by new volume.
Aircraft subject to leases with a carrying value of approximately $84 million are scheduled to be returned off lease
during 2019. We are seeking to remarket these aircraft or have the leases extended.
BCC enters into certain transactions with Boeing, reflected in Unallocated items, eliminations and other, in the form of
intercompany guarantees and other subsidies that mitigate the effects of certain credit quality or asset impairment
issues on the BCC segment.

billion during 2017 and $10.5 billion in 2016. The increase of $2.0 billion in 2018 was primarily driven by higher
earnings and lower spending on inventory, partially offset by lower advances. The increase of $2.9 billion in 2017 was
primarily driven by higher advances more than offsetting inventory increases.
36
Table of Contents
Advances and progress billings increased by $2.6 billion in 2018, increased by $4.7 billion in 2017 and decreased by
$1.3 billion in 2016. During 2017, our discretionary contributions to our pension plans included $14.4 million shares of
our common stock with an aggregate value of $3.5 billion and $0.5 billion in cash. Discretionary contributions to our
pension plans were insignificant in 2018 and 2016.
Investing Activities Cash used by investing activities during 2018, 2017 and 2016 was $4.6 billion, $2.1 billion and
$3.4 billion primarily due to acquisitions during the second half of 2018 and the timing of investments. Acquisitions net
of cash acquired were $3.2 billion in 2018, compared with $0.3 billion in 2017 and 2016. Capital expenditures totaled
$1.7 billion in both 2018 and 2017, down from $2.6 billion in 2016. We expect capital expenditures in 2019 to be higher
than 2018. Net proceeds from investments was $0.3 billion in 2018 and insignificant in 2017, compared with net
contributions to investments of $0.5 billion in 2016.
Financing Activities Cash used by financing activities was $11.7 billion during 2018, an increase of $0.4 billion
compared with 2017 primarily due to higher dividend payments partially offset by higher net borrowings. Cash used by
financing activities was $11.4 billion during 2017, an increase of $1.8 billion compared with 2016, primarily due to
higher share repurchases and dividend payments. Net borrowings were $1.4 billion in 2018, $1.1 billion in 2017 and
insignificant in 2016.
At December 31, 2018 and 2017 the recorded balance of debt was $13.8 billion and $11.1 billion of which $3.2 billion
and $1.3 billion was classified as short-term. At December 31, 2018 and 2017 this included $2.5 billion of debt
attributable to BCC, of which $0.5 billion and $0.9 billion were classified as short-term.
During 2018 and 2017 we repurchased 26.1 million and 46.1 million shares totaling $9.0 billion and $9.2 billion through
our open market share repurchase program. In 2018 and 2017, we had 0.7 million shares transferred to us from
employees for tax withholdings. At December 31, 2018, the amount available under the share repurchase plan,
announced on December 17, 2018, totaled $20 billion.
Capital Resources We have substantial borrowing capacity. Any future borrowings may affect our credit ratings and
are subject to various debt covenants as described below. We have a commercial paper program that serves as a
source of short-term liquidity. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, commercial paper borrowings totaling $1,895 million
and $600 million, which were supported by unused commitments under the revolving credit agreement. We had no
commercial paper borrowings in 2016. At December 31, 2018, we had $5.1 billion of unused borrowing capacity on
revolving credit line agreements. We anticipate that these credit lines will primarily serve as backup liquidity to support
our general corporate borrowing needs.
Financing commitments totaled $19.5 billion and $10.2 billion at December 31, 2018 and 2017. The increase primarily
relates to commercial airplane orders received in 2018. We anticipate that we will not be required to fund a significant
portion of our financing commitments as we continue to work with third party financiers to provide alternative financing
to customers. Historically, we have not been required to fund significant amounts of outstanding commitments.
However, there can be no assurances that we will not be required to fund greater amounts than historically required. In
addition, many of our non-U.S. customers finance aircraft purchases through the Export-Import Bank of the United
States. Following the expiration of the bank’s charter on June 30, 2015, the bank’s charter was reauthorized in
December 2015. The bank is now authorized through September 30, 2019. However, until the U.S. Senate confirms
members sufficient to reconstitute a quorum of the bank’s board of directors, the bank will not be able to approve any
transaction totaling more than $10 million. As a result, we may fund additional commitments and/or enter into new
financing arrangements with customers.
In the event we require additional funding to support strategic business opportunities, our commercial aircraft financing
commitments, unfavorable resolution of litigation or other loss contingencies, or other business requirements, we
expect to meet increased funding requirements by issuing commercial paper or term debt. We believe our ability to
access external capital resources should be sufficient to satisfy existing short-term and long-term commitments and
plans, and also to provide adequate financial flexibility
37
Table of Contents
to take advantage of potential strategic business opportunities should they arise within the next year. However, there
can be no assurance of the cost or availability of future borrowings under our commercial paper program or in the debt
markets.
At December 31, 2018 and 2017, our pension plans were $15.3 billion and $16.4 billion underfunded as measured
under GAAP. On an Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) basis our plans are 96% funded at December
31, 2018 with minimal required contributions in 2019. We do not expect to make contributions to our pension plans in
2019. We may be required to make higher contributions to our pension plans in future years.
At December 31, 2018, we were in compliance with the covenants for our debt and credit facilities. The most restrictive
covenants include a limitation on mortgage debt and sale and leaseback transactions as a percentage of consolidated
net tangible assets (as defined in the credit agreements), and a limitation on consolidated debt as a percentage of total
capital (as defined). When considering debt covenants, we continue to have substantial borrowing capacity.

million, was $2,392 million. For further discussion of income taxes, see Note 6 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. We are not able to
reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows related to uncertain tax positions.
Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits Pension cash requirements are based on an estimate of our minimum
funding requirements, pursuant to ERISA regulations, although we may make additional discretionary contributions.
Estimates of other postretirement benefits are based on both our estimated future benefit payments and the estimated
contributions to plans that are funded through trusts.
Purchase Obligations Purchase obligations represent contractual agreements to purchase goods or services that are
legally binding; specify a fixed, minimum or range of quantities; specify a fixed, minimum, variable, or indexed price
provision; and specify approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations include amounts recorded as well as
amounts that are not recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.
38
Table of Contents
Purchase Obligations Not Recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position Purchase obligations
not recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position include agreements for inventory procurement,
tooling costs, electricity and natural gas contracts, property, plant and equipment, customer financing equipment, and
other miscellaneous production related obligations. The most significant obligation relates to inventory procurement
contracts. We have entered into certain significant inventory procurement contracts that specify determinable prices
and quantities, and long-term delivery timeframes. In addition, we purchase raw materials on behalf of our suppliers.
These agreements require suppliers and vendors to be prepared to build and deliver items in sufficient time to meet our
production schedules. The need for such arrangements with suppliers and vendors arises from the extended
production planning horizon for many of our products. A significant portion of these inventory commitments is supported
by firm contracts and/or has historically resulted in settlement through reimbursement from customers for penalty
payments to the supplier should the customer not take delivery. These amounts are also included in our forecasts of
costs for program and contract accounting. Some inventory procurement contracts may include escalation adjustments.
In these limited cases, we have included our best estimate of the effect of the escalation adjustment in the amounts
disclosed in the table above.
Purchase Obligations Recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position Purchase obligations
recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position primarily include accounts payable and certain other
current and long-term liabilities including accrued compensation.
Industrial Participation Agreements We have entered into various industrial participation agreements with certain
customers outside of the U.S. to facilitate economic flow back and/or technology or skills transfer to their businesses or
government agencies as the result of their procurement of goods and/or services from us. These commitments may be
satisfied by our local operations there, placement of direct work or vendor orders for supplies, opportunities to bid on
supply contracts, transfer of technology or other forms of assistance. However, in certain cases, our commitments may
be satisfied through other parties (such as our vendors) who purchase supplies from our non-U.S. customers. In certain
cases, penalties could be imposed if we do not meet our industrial participation commitments. During 2018, we incurred
no such penalties. As of December 31, 2018, we have outstanding industrial participation agreements totaling $18.4
billion that extend through 2030. Purchase order commitments associated with industrial participation agreements are
included in purchase obligations in the table above. To be eligible for such a purchase order commitment from us, a
non-U.S. supplier must have sufficient capability to meet our requirements and must be competitive in cost, quality and
schedule.

Commercial aircraft financing commitments include commitments to provide financing related to aircraft on order, under
option for deliveries or proposed as part of sales campaigns or refinancing with respect to delivered aircraft, based on
estimated earliest potential funding dates. Based on historical experience, we anticipate that we will not be required to
fund a significant portion of our financing commitments. However, there can be no assurances that we will not be
required to fund greater amounts than historically required, particularly if the Export-Import Bank of the United States
continues to be unable to, or does not, provide new financing support. See Note 14 to our Consolidated Financial
Statements.
Contingent Obligations
We have significant contingent obligations that arise in the ordinary course of business, which include the following:
Legal Various legal proceedings, claims and investigations are pending against us. Legal contingencies are discussed
in Note 22 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
Environmental Remediation We are involved with various environmental remediation activities and have recorded a
liability of $555 million at December 31, 2018. For additional information, see Note 14 to our Consolidated Financial
Statements.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We are a party to certain off-balance sheet arrangements including certain guarantees. For discussion of these
arrangements, see Note 15 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
Non-GAAP Measures
Core Operating Earnings, Core Operating Margin and Core Earnings Per Share
Our Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in
the United States of America (GAAP) which we supplement with certain non-GAAP financial information. These non-
GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP measures, and other
companies may define such measures differently. We encourage investors to review our financial statements and
publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. Core operating earnings, core
operating margin and core earnings per share exclude the FAS/CAS service cost adjustment. The FAS/CAS service
cost adjustment represents the difference between the FAS pension and postretirement service costs calculated under
GAAP and costs allocated to the business segments. Core earnings per share excludes both the FAS/CAS service cost
adjustment and non-operating pension and postretirement expenses. Non-operating pension and postretirement
expenses represent the components of net periodic benefit costs other than service cost. Pension costs, comprising
service and prior service costs computed in accordance with GAAP are allocated
40
Table of Contents
to BCA and certain BGS businesses supporting commercial customers. Pension costs allocated to BDS and BGS
businesses supporting government customers are computed in accordance with U.S. Government Cost Accounting
Standards (CAS), which employ different actuarial assumptions and accounting conventions than GAAP. CAS costs are
allocable to government contracts. Other postretirement benefit costs are allocated to all business segments based on
CAS, which is generally based on benefits paid.
The Pension FAS/CAS service cost adjustment recognized in earnings during 2018 was a benefit of $1,005 million,
largely consistent with a benefit of $1,127 million in 2017 and $1,029 million in 2016. The non-operating pension
expense included in Other income/(loss), net was a benefit of $143 million in 2018 and $117 million in 2017, compared
with an expense of $327 million in 2016. The benefits in 2018 and 2017 reflect expected returns in excess of interest
cost and amortization of actuarial losses. The expense in 2016 reflects the amortization of non-service costs previously
capitalized as inventory in prior years, primarily interest cost and amortization of actuarial losses in excess of expected
returns.
For further discussion of pension and other postretirement costs see the Management’s Discussion and Analysis on
page 21 of this Form 10-K and see Note 23 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Management uses core
operating earnings, core operating margin and core earnings per share for purposes of evaluating and forecasting
underlying business performance. Management believes these core earnings measures provide investors additional
insights into operational performance as unallocated pension and other postretirement benefit cost, primarily represent
costs driven by market factors and costs not allocable to U.S. government contracts.

Section 219 of the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012 and Section 13(r) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, require disclosure of certain activities, transactions or dealings relating to Iran that
occurred during the period covered by this report. Disclosure is required even if the activities, transactions or dealings
were conducted in compliance with applicable law. In connection with the U.S. withdrawal from the Joint
Comprehensive Plan of Action (Iran Nuclear Agreement), we engaged in activities during the third quarter that were
required to unwind and terminate all agreements with Iranian airlines entered into prior to the withdrawal. These
activities were authorized by a license from the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), and generated no
revenues or profits. In addition, during the fourth quarter Iran Aseman Airlines requested Boeing support, and we
replied that the current laws of the United States do not permit Boeing to provide any services, parts, or aircraft without
a license from OFAC.
Critical Accounting Policies
Accounting for long-term contracts
Substantially all contracts at BDS, certain military derivative aircraft contracts at BCA and certain contracts at BGS are
long-term contracts. Our long-term contracts typically represent a single distinct performance obligation due to the
highly interdependent and interrelated nature of the underlying goods and/or services and the significant service of
integration that we provide.
Accounting for long-term contracts involves a judgmental process of estimating the total sales, costs, and profit for each
performance obligation. Cost of sales is recognized as incurred and revenue is determined by adding a proportionate
amount of the estimated profit to the amount reported as cost of sales.
Due to the size, duration and nature of many of our long-term contracts, the estimation of total sales and costs through
completion is complicated and subject to many variables. Total sales estimates are based on negotiated contract prices
and quantities, modified by our assumptions regarding contract options, change orders, incentive and award provisions
associated with technical performance, and price adjustment clauses (such as inflation or index-based clauses). The
majority of these long-term contracts are with the U.S. government where the price is generally based on estimated
cost to produce the product or service plus profit. Federal Acquisition Regulations provide guidance on the types of cost
that will be reimbursed in establishing contract price. Total cost estimates are largely based on negotiated or estimated
purchase contract terms, historical performance trends, business base and other economic projections. Factors that
influence these estimates include inflationary trends, technical and schedule risk, internal and subcontractor
performance trends, business volume assumptions, asset utilization, and anticipated labor agreements.
Revenue and cost estimates for all significant long-term contract performance obligations are reviewed and reassessed
quarterly. Changes in these estimates could result in recognition of cumulative catch-up adjustments to the
performance obligation’s inception to date revenues, cost of sales and profit, in the period in which such changes are
made. Changes in revenue and cost estimates could also result in a reach-forward loss or an adjustment to a reach-
forward loss, which would be recorded immediately in earnings. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2016 net
unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments, including reach-forward losses, across all long-term contracts decreased
Earnings from operations by $190 million and $263 million. For the year ended December 31, 2017, net favorable
cumulative catch-up adjustments, including reach-forward losses, across all long-term contracts increased Earnings
from operations by $250 million.
Due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above, it is likely that materially different
earnings could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change.
Changes in underlying assumptions/estimates, supplier performance, or circumstances
43

may adversely or positively affect financial performance in future periods. If the combined gross margin for all long-term
contract performance obligations for all of 2018 had been estimated to be higher or lower by 1%, it would have
increased or decreased pre-tax income for the year by approximately $297 million. In addition, a number of our fixed
price development contracts are in a reach-forward loss position. Changes to estimated losses are recorded
immediately in earnings.
Program Accounting
Program accounting requires the demonstrated ability to reliably estimate the relationship of sales to costs for the
defined program accounting quantity. A program consists of the estimated number of units (accounting quantity) of a
product to be produced in a continuing, long-term production effort for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts.
The determination of the accounting quantity is limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates of the
revenue and cost of existing and anticipated contracts. For each program, the amount reported as cost of sales is
determined by applying the estimated cost of sales percentage for the total remaining program to the amount of sales
recognized for airplanes delivered and accepted by the customer.
Factors that must be estimated include program accounting quantity, sales price, labor and employee benefit costs,
material costs, procured part costs, major component costs, overhead costs, program tooling and other non-recurring
costs, and warranty costs. Estimation of the accounting quantity for each program takes into account several factors
that are indicative of the demand for the particular program, such as firm orders, letters of intent from prospective
customers, and market studies. Total estimated program sales are determined by estimating the model mix and sales
price for all unsold units within the accounting quantity, added together with the sales prices for all undelivered units
under contract. The sales prices for all undelivered units within the accounting quantity include an escalation
adjustment for inflation that is updated quarterly. Cost estimates are based largely on negotiated and anticipated
contracts with suppliers, historical performance trends, and business base and other economic projections. Factors that
influence these estimates include production rates, internal and subcontractor performance trends, customer and/or
supplier claims or assertions, asset utilization, anticipated labor agreements, and inflationary or deflationary trends.
To ensure reliability in our estimates, we employ a rigorous estimating process that is reviewed and updated on a
quarterly basis. Changes in estimates are normally recognized on a prospective basis; however, when estimated costs
to complete a program exceed estimated revenues from undelivered units in the accounting quantity, a loss provision is
recorded in the current period for the estimated loss on all undelivered units in the accounting quantity. For example, in
2016, we recorded a reach-forward loss of $1,258 million on the 747 program.
The program method of accounting allocates tooling and other non-recurring and production costs over the accounting
quantity for each program. Because of the higher unit production costs experienced at the beginning of a new program
and substantial investment required for initial tooling and other non-recurring costs, new commercial aircraft programs,
such as the 787 and 777X programs, typically have lower initial margins than established programs. In addition, actual
costs incurred for earlier units in excess of the estimated average cost of all units in the program accounting quantity
are included within program inventory as deferred production costs. Deferred production, unamortized tooling and other
non-recurring costs are expected to be fully recovered when all units in the accounting quantity are delivered as the
expected unit cost for later deliveries is below the estimated average cost as learning curve and other improvements
are realized.
Due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above, it is reasonably possible that changes in
underlying circumstances or assumptions could have a material effect on program gross margins. If the combined
gross margin percentages for our commercial airplane programs had been estimated to be 1% higher or lower it would
have a similar effect on the Commercial Airplane segment’s
44
Table of Contents
operating margins. For the year ended December 31, 2018, a 1% increase or decrease in operating margins for our
Commercial Airplane segment would have a $607 million impact on operating earnings.
Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Impairments
We test goodwill for impairment by performing a qualitative assessment or using a two-step impairment process. If we
choose to perform a qualitative assessment, we evaluate economic, industry and company-specific factors as an initial
step in assessing the fair value of operations. If we determine it is more likely than not that the carrying value of the net
assets is more than the fair value of the related operations, the two-step impairment process is then performed;
otherwise, no further testing is required. For operations where the two-step impairment process is used, we first
compare the book value of net assets to the fair value of the related operations. If the fair value is determined to be less
than book value, a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment. In this process, a fair value for
goodwill is estimated, based in part on the fair value of the operations, and is compared to its carrying value. The
shortfall of the fair value below carrying value represents the amount of goodwill impairment.
We estimate the fair values of the related operations using discounted cash flows. Forecasts of future cash flows are
based on our best estimate of future sales and operating costs, based primarily on existing firm orders, expected future
orders, contracts with suppliers, labor agreements and general market conditions. Changes in these forecasts could
significantly change the amount of impairment recorded, if any.
The cash flow forecasts are adjusted by an appropriate discount rate derived from our market capitalization plus a
suitable control premium at the date of evaluation. Therefore, changes in the stock price may also affect the amount of
impairment recorded, if any.
We completed our assessment of goodwill as of April 1, 2018 and determined that there is no impairment of goodwill.
As of December 31, 2018, we estimated that the fair value of each reporting unit significantly exceeded its
corresponding carrying value. Changes in our forecasts, or decreases in the value of our common stock could cause
book values of certain operations to exceed their fair values which may result in goodwill impairment charges in future
periods.
As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had $490 million of indefinite-lived intangible assets related to the Jeppesen
and Aviall brand and trade names acquired in business combinations. We test these intangibles for impairment by
comparing their carrying value to current projections of discounted cash flows attributable to the brand and trade
names. Any excess carrying value over the amount of discounted cash flows represents the amount of the impairment.
A 10% decrease in the discounted cash flows would not impact the carrying value of these indefinite-lived intangible
assets.
Pension Plans
The majority of our employees have earned benefits under defined benefit pension plans. Nonunion and the majority of
union employees that had participated in defined benefit pension plans transitioned to a company-funded defined
contribution retirement savings plan in 2016. Additional union employees transitioned to company-funded defined
contribution retirement savings plans effective January 1, 2019. Accounting rules require an annual measurement of
our projected obligation and plan assets. These measurements are based upon several assumptions, including the
discount rate and the expected long-term rate of asset return. Future changes in assumptions or differences between
actual and expected outcomes can significantly affect our future annual expense, projected benefit obligation and
Shareholders’ equity.

The following table shows the sensitivity of our pension plan liability and net periodic cost to a 25 basis point change in
the discount rate as of December 31, 2018.

Pension cost is also sensitive to changes in the expected long-term rate of asset return. A decrease or increase of 25
basis points in the expected long-term rate of asset return would have increased or decreased 2018 net periodic
pension cost by $154 million.
Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
Interest Rate Risk
We have financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk, principally fixed-rate debt obligations, and customer
financing assets and liabilities. Additionally, BCC uses interest rate swaps with certain debt obligations to manage
exposure to interest rate changes. Historically, we have not experienced material gains or losses on our customer
financing assets and liabilities due to interest rate changes. As of December 31, 2018, the impact over the next 12
months of a 100 basis point rise in interest rates to our pre-tax earnings would not be significant. The investors in our
fixed-rate debt obligations do not generally have the right to demand we pay off these obligations prior to maturity.
Therefore, exposure to interest rate risk is not believed to be material for our fixed-rate debt.
Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk
We are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk relating to receipts from customers and payments to suppliers in
foreign currencies. We use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the price risk associated with firmly committed
and forecasted foreign denominated payments and receipts related to our ongoing business. Foreign currency forward
contracts are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. At December 31, 2018, a 10% increase or
decrease in the exchange rate in our portfolio of foreign currency contracts would have increased or decreased our
unrealized losses by $262 million. Consistent with the use of these contracts to neutralize the effect of exchange rate
fluctuations, such unrealized losses or gains would be offset by corresponding gains or losses, respectively, in the
remeasurement of the underlying transactions being hedged. When taken together, these forward currency contracts
and the offsetting underlying commitments do not create material market risk.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
Years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016
(Dollars in millions, except per share data)
Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation
The Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report have been prepared by management of The Boeing
Company (herein referred to as “Boeing,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”). These statements include the accounts
of all majority-owned subsidiaries and variable interest entities that are required to be consolidated. All significant
intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. As described in Note 23, effective July 1, 2017, we now
operate in four reportable segments: Commercial Airplanes (BCA); Defense, Space & Security (BDS), Global Services
(BGS), and Boeing Capital (BCC). Amounts in prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current year
presentation.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Operating Cycle
For classification of certain current assets and liabilities, we use the duration of the related contract or program as our
operating cycle, which is generally longer than one year.
Standards Issued and Implemented
In the first quarter of 2018, we adopted the following Accounting Standards Updates (ASUs): ASU 2014-09, Revenue
from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606); ASU 2017-07,Compensation - Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Improving
the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost; ASU 2016-18 Statement
of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash; ASU 2018-02, Income Statement—Reporting Comprehensive Income
(Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income.
The impact of the adoption of these standards to our Consolidated Financial Statements is presented in Note 2 and the
additional disclosures are shown in Notes 9 and 23.
ASU 2014-09 In the first quarter of 2018, we adopted ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic
606), using the full retrospective method. Topic 606 requires revenue to be recognized when promised goods or
services are transferred to customers in amounts that reflect the consideration to which the Company expects to be
entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
Most of our defense contracts at our BDS and BGS segments and certain military derivative aircraft contracts at our
BCA segment now recognize revenue under the new standard as costs are incurred. Under previous GAAP, revenue
was generally recognized when deliveries were made, performance milestones were attained, or as costs were
incurred. The new standard accelerates the timing of when the revenue is recognized, however, it does not change the
total amount of revenue recognized on these contracts. The new standard does not affect revenue recognition or the
use of program accounting for commercial airplane contracts in our BCA business. We continue to recognize revenue
for these contracts
54
Table of Contents
at the point in time when the customer accepts delivery of the airplane. The adoption resulted in a cumulative
adjustment to increase Retained earnings by $901 at January 1, 2016, an increase of $139 to Net earnings for the year
ended December 31, 2016, and an increase of $261 to Net earnings for the year ended December 31, 2017.
ASU 2017-07 In the first quarter of 2018, we adopted ASU 2017-07, Compensation - Retirement Benefits (Topic 715):
Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost. The standard
requires non-service cost components of net periodic benefit cost to be presented in non-operating earnings using a
retrospective transition method. We applied a practical expedient as the estimation basis for the reclassification of prior
period non-service cost components of net periodic benefit cost from Earnings from operations to Other income/(loss),
net. Through the end of 2017, a portion of net periodic pension and other postretirement income or expense was not
recognized in net earnings in the year incurred because it was allocated to production as product costs, and reflected in
inventory at the end of the reporting periods. Effective January 1, 2018, in accordance with our adoption of ASU 2017-
07, only service costs may be allocated to production costs and capitalized in inventory on a prospective basis. The
impact of adoption was not material.
ASU 2016-18 In the first quarter of 2018, we adopted ASU 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted
Cash. The standard requires companies to include restricted amounts with Cash & cash equivalents when reconciling
the beginning and end of period total amounts shown on the Statements of Cash Flows. The impact of adoption was
not material.
ASU 2018-02 In the first quarter of 2018, we early adopted ASU 2018-02, Income Statement—Reporting
Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive
Income. The standard allows companies to reclassify from Accumulated other comprehensive income/loss to Retained
earnings the difference between the historical corporate income tax rate of 35% and the 21% rate enacted in the Tax
Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) in December 2017. This resulted in an increase of $2,997 to Retained earnings and an
increase of $2,997 to Accumulated other comprehensive loss.
Revenue and Related Cost Recognition
Commercial aircraft contracts The majority of our BCA segment revenue is derived from commercial aircraft
contracts. For each contract, we determine the transaction price based on the consideration expected to be received.
We allocate the transaction price to each commercial aircraft performance obligation based on relative standalone
selling prices adjusted by an escalation formula as specified in the customer agreement. Revenue is recognized for
each commercial aircraft performance obligation at the point in time when the aircraft is completed and accepted by the
customer. We use program accounting to determine the amount reported as cost of sales.
Where an aircraft is still in our possession, and title and risk of loss has passed to the customer (known as a bill-and-
hold arrangement), revenue will be recognized when all specific requirements for transfer of control under a bill-and-
hold arrangement have been met.
Payments for commercial aircraft sales are received in accordance with the customer agreement, which generally
includes a deposit upon order and additional payments in accordance with a payment schedule, with the balance being
due immediately prior to or at aircraft delivery. Advances and progress billings (contract liabilities) are normal and
customary for commercial aircraft contracts and not considered a significant financing component as they are intended
to protect us from the other party failing to adequately complete some or all of its obligations under the contract.
Long-term contracts Substantially all contracts at BDS, certain military derivative aircraft contracts at BCA and certain
contracts at BGS are long-term contracts with the U.S. government and other customers that generally extend over
several years. Products sales under long-term contracts primarily include fighter
55
Table of Contents
jets, rotorcraft, cybersecurity products, surveillance suites, advanced weapons, missile defense, military derivative
aircraft, satellite systems, and modification of commercial passenger aircraft to cargo freighters. Services sales under
long-term contracts primarily include support and maintenance agreements associated with our commercial and
defense products and space travel on Commercial Crew.
For each long-term contract, we determine the transaction price based on the consideration expected to be received.
We allocate the transaction price to each distinct performance obligation to deliver a good or service, or a collection of
goods and/or services, based on the relative standalone selling prices. A long-term contract will typically represent a
single distinct performance obligation due to the highly interdependent and interrelated nature of the underlying goods
and/or services and the significant service of integration that we provide. While the scope and price on certain long-
term contracts may be modified over their life, the transaction price is based on current rights and obligations under the
contract and does not include potential modifications until they are agreed upon with the customer. When applicable, a
cumulative adjustment or separate recognition for the additional scope and price may result. Long-term contracts can
be negotiated with a fixed price or a price in which we are reimbursed for costs incurred plus an agreed upon profit. The
Federal Acquisition Regulations provide guidance on the types of cost that will be reimbursed in establishing the price
for contracts with the U.S. government. Certain long-term contracts include in the transaction price variable
consideration, such as incentive and award fees, if specified targets are achieved. The amount included in the
transaction price represents the expected value, based on a weighted probability, or the most likely amount.
Long-term contract revenue is recognized over the contract term (over time) as the work progresses, either as products
are produced or as services are rendered. We generally recognize revenue over time as we perform on long-term
contracts because of continuous transfer of control to the customer. For U.S. government contracts, this continuous
transfer of control to the customer is supported by clauses in the contract that allow the customer to unilaterally
terminate the contract for convenience, pay us for costs incurred plus a reasonable profit and take control of any work
in process. Similarly, for non-U.S. government contracts, the customer typically controls the work in process as
evidenced either by contractual termination clauses or by our rights to payment of the transaction price associated with
work performed to date on products or services that do not have an alternative use to the Company.
The accounting for long-term contracts involves a judgmental process of estimating total sales, costs and profit for each
performance obligation. Cost of sales is recognized as incurred. The amount reported as revenues is determined by
adding a proportionate amount of the estimated profit to the amount reported as cost of sales. Recognizing revenue as
costs are incurred provides an objective measure of progress on the long-term contract and thereby best depicts the
extent of transfer of control to the customer.
Changes in estimated revenues, cost of sales and the related effect on operating income are recognized using a
cumulative catch-up adjustment which recognizes in the current period the cumulative effect of the changes on current
and prior periods based on a long-term contract’s percentage-of-completion. When the current estimates of total sales
and costs for a long-term contract indicate a loss, a provision for the entire reach-forward loss on the long-term contract
is recognized.
Net cumulative catch-up adjustments to prior years' revenue and earnings, including certain reach-forward losses,
across all long-term contracts were as follows:
 2018 2017 2016
Increase to Revenue $137 $559 $394
Increase/(decrease) to Earnings from Operations ($190) $250 ($263)
Increase/(decrease) to Diluted EPS ($0.29) $0.34 ($0.36)
Significant adjustments during the three years ended December 31, 2018 included reach-forward losses of $736, $445
and $1,127 on the USAF KC-46A Tanker contract recorded during 2018, 2017 and 2016.
56
Table of Contents
Due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process changes in underlying assumptions/estimates, supplier
performance, or circumstances may adversely or positively affect financial performance in future periods.
Payments under long-term contracts may be received before or after revenue is recognized. The U.S. government
customer typically withholds payment of a small portion of the contract price until contract completion. Therefore, long-
term contracts typically generate Unbilled receivables (contract assets) but may generate Advances and progress
billings (contract liabilities). Long-term contract Unbilled receivables and Advances and progress billings are not
considered a significant financing component because they are intended to protect either the customer or the Company
in the event that some or all of the obligations under the contract are not completed.
Commercial spare parts contracts Certain contracts at our BGS segment include sales of commercial spare parts.
For each contract, we determine the transaction price based on the consideration expected to be received. The spare
parts have discrete unit prices that represent fair value. We generally consider each spare part to be a separate
performance obligation. Revenue is recognized for each commercial spare part performance obligation at the point in
time of delivery to the customer. We may provide our customers with a right to return a commercial spare part where a
customer may receive a full or partial refund, a credit applied to amounts owed, a different product in exchange, or any
combination of these items. We consider the potential for customer returns in the estimated transaction price. The
amount reported as cost of sales is recorded at average cost. Payments for commercial spare parts sales are typically
received shortly after delivery.
Other service revenue contracts Certain contracts at our BGS segment are for sales of services to commercial
customers including maintenance, training, data analytics and information-based services. We recognize revenue for
these service performance obligations over time as the services are rendered. The method of measuring progress
(such as straight-line or billable amount) varies depending upon which method best depicts the transfer of control to the
customer based on the type of service performed. Cost of sales is recorded as incurred.
Concession Sharing Arrangements We account for sales concessions to our customers in consideration of their
purchase of products and services as a reduction of the transaction price and the revenue that is recognized for the
related performance obligations. The sales concessions incurred may be partially reimbursed by certain suppliers in
accordance with concession sharing arrangements. We record these reimbursements, which are presumed to
represent reductions in the price of the vendor’s products or services, as a reduction in Cost of products.
Unbilled Receivables and Advances and Progress Billings
Unbilled receivables (contract assets) arise when the Company recognizes revenue for amounts which cannot yet be
billed under terms of the contract with the customer. Advances and progress billings (contract liabilities) arise when the
Company receives payments from customers in advance of recognizing revenue. The amount of Unbilled receivables
or Advances and progress billings is determined for each contract.
Financial Services Revenue We record financial services revenue associated with sales-type/finance leases,
operating leases, and notes receivable.
Lease and financing revenue arrangements are included in Sales of services on the Consolidated Statements of
Operations. For sales-type/finance leases, we record an asset at lease inception. This asset is recorded at the
aggregate of future minimum lease payments, estimated residual value of the leased equipment, and deferred
incremental direct costs less unearned income. Income is recognized over the life of the lease to approximate a level
rate of return on the net investment. Residual values, which are reviewed periodically, represent the estimated amount
we expect to receive at lease termination from the disposition of the leased equipment. Actual residual values realized
could differ from these estimates.
57
Table of Contents
Declines in estimated residual value that are deemed other-than-temporary are recognized in the period in which the
declines occur.
For operating leases, revenue on leased aircraft and equipment is recorded on a straight-line basis over the term of the
lease. Operating lease assets, included in Customer financing, are recorded at cost and depreciated over the period
that we project we will hold the asset to an estimated residual value, using the straight-line method. We periodically
review our estimates of residual value and recognize forecasted changes by prospectively adjusting depreciation
expense.
For notes receivable, notes are recorded net of any unamortized discounts and deferred incremental direct costs.
Interest income and amortization of any discounts are recorded ratably over the related term of the note.
Reinsurance Revenue Our wholly-owned insurance subsidiary, Astro Ltd., participates in a reinsurance pool for
workers’ compensation. The member agreements and practices of the reinsurance pool minimize any participating
members’ individual risk. Reinsurance revenues were $145, $141 and $147 during 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
Reinsurance costs related to premiums and claims paid to the reinsurance pool were $136, $144 and $139 during
2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Revenues and costs are presented net in Cost of sales in the Consolidated
Statements of Operations.
Fleet Support
We provide assistance and support to facilitate efficient and safe aircraft operation to the operators of all our
commercial airplane models. Collectively known as fleet support, these activities and support services include flight and
maintenance training, field service support, engineering support, and technical data and documents. Fleet support
activity begins prior to aircraft delivery as the customer receives training, manuals, and technical consulting support.
This activity continues throughout the aircraft’s operational life. Services provided after delivery include field service
support, consulting on maintenance, repair, and operational issues brought forth by the customer or regulators,
updating manuals and engineering data, and the issuance of service bulletins that impact the entire model’s fleet. Field
service support involves our personnel located at customer facilities providing and coordinating fleet support activities
and requests. The costs for fleet support are expensed as incurred as Cost of services.
Research and Development
Research and development includes costs incurred for experimentation, design, and testing, as well as bid and
proposal efforts related to government products and services which are expensed as incurred unless the costs are
related to certain contractual arrangements with customers. Costs that are incurred pursuant to such contractual
arrangements are recorded over the period that revenue is recognized, consistent with our contract accounting policy.
We have certain research and development arrangements that meet the requirement for best efforts research and
development accounting. Accordingly, the amounts funded by the customer are recognized as an offset to our research
and development expense rather than as contract revenues. Research and development expense included bid and
proposal costs of $234, $288 and $311 in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
Share-Based Compensation
We provide various forms of share-based compensation to our employees. For awards settled in shares, we measure
compensation expense based on the grant-date fair value net of estimated forfeitures. For awards settled in cash, or
that may be settled in cash, we measure compensation expense based on the fair value at each reporting date net of
estimated forfeitures. The expense is recognized over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period
of the award.
58
Table of Contents
Income Taxes
Provisions for U.S. federal, state and local, and non-U.S. income taxes are calculated on reported Earnings before
income taxes based on current tax law and also include, in the current period, the cumulative effect of any changes in
tax rates from those used previously in determining deferred tax assets and liabilities. Such provisions differ from the
amounts currently receivable or payable because certain items of income and expense are recognized in different time
periods for financial reporting purposes than for income tax purposes. Significant judgment is required in determining
income tax provisions and evaluating tax positions.
The accounting for uncertainty in income taxes requires a more-likely-than-not threshold for financial statement
recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We record a liability for the
difference between the benefit recognized and measured for financial statement purposes and the tax position taken or
expected to be taken on our tax return. To the extent that our assessment of such tax positions changes, the change in
estimate is recorded in the period in which the determination is made. Tax-related interest and penalties are classified
as a component of Income tax expense.
Postretirement Plans
The majority of our employees have earned benefits under defined benefit pension plans. Nonunion and the majority of
union employees that had participated in defined benefit pension plans transitioned to a company-funded defined
contribution retirement savings plan in 2016. We also provide postretirement benefit plans other than pensions,
consisting principally of health care coverage to eligible retirees and qualifying dependents. Benefits under the pension
and other postretirement benefit plans are generally based on age at retirement and years of service and, for some
pension plans, benefits are also based on the employee’s annual earnings. The net periodic cost of our pension and
other postretirement plans is determined using the projected unit credit method and several actuarial assumptions, the
most significant of which are the discount rate, the long-term rate of asset return, and medical trend (rate of growth for
medical costs). A portion of the service cost component of net periodic pension and other postretirement income or
expense is not recognized in net earnings in the year incurred because it is allocated to production as product costs,
and reflected in inventory at the end of a reporting period. Actuarial gains and losses, which occur when actual
experience differs from actuarial assumptions, are reflected in Shareholders’ equity (net of taxes). If actuarial gains and
losses exceed ten percent of the greater of plan assets or plan liabilities we amortize them over the average future
service period of employees. The funded status of our pension and postretirement plans is reflected on the
Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.
Postemployment Plans
We record a liability for postemployment benefits, such as severance or job training, when payment is probable, the
amount is reasonably estimable, and the obligation relates to rights that have vested or accumulated.
59
Table of Contents
Environmental Remediation
We are subject to federal and state requirements for protection of the environment, including those for discharge of
hazardous materials and remediation of contaminated sites. We routinely assess, based on in-depth studies, expert
analyses and legal reviews, our contingencies, obligations, and commitments for remediation of contaminated sites,
including assessments of ranges and probabilities of recoveries from other responsible parties and/or insurance
carriers. Our policy is to accrue and charge to current expense identified exposures related to environmental
remediation sites when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated.
The amount of the liability is based on our best estimate or the low end of a range of reasonably possible exposure for
investigation, cleanup, and monitoring costs to be incurred. Estimated remediation costs are not discounted to present
value as the timing of payments cannot be reasonably estimated. We may be able to recover a portion of the
remediation costs from insurers or other third parties. Such recoveries are recorded when realization of the claim for
recovery is deemed probable.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid instruments, such as commercial paper, time deposits, and other
money market instruments, which have original maturities of three months or less. We aggregate our cash balances by
bank where conditions for right of set-off are met, and reclassify any negative balances, consisting mainly of uncleared
checks, to Accounts payable. Negative balances reclassified to Accounts payable were $127 and $116 at December
31, 2018 and 2017.
Inventories
Inventoried costs on commercial aircraft programs and long-term contracts include direct engineering, production and
tooling and other non-recurring costs, and applicable overhead, which includes fringe benefits, production related
indirect and plant management salaries and plant services, not in excess of estimated net realizable value. To the
extent a material amount of such costs are related to an abnormal event or are fixed costs not appropriately attributable
to our programs or contracts, they are expensed in the current period rather than inventoried. Inventoried costs include
amounts relating to programs and contracts with long-term production cycles, a portion of which is not expected to be
realized within one year. Included in inventory for federal government contracts is an allocation of allowable costs
related to manufacturing process reengineering.
Commercial aircraft programs inventory includes deferred production costs and supplier advances. Deferred production
costs represent actual costs incurred for production of early units that exceed the estimated average cost of all units in
the program accounting quantity. Higher production costs are experienced at the beginning of a new or derivative
airplane program. Units produced early in a program require substantially more effort (labor and other resources) than
units produced later in a program because of volume efficiencies and the effects of learning. We expect that these
deferred costs will be fully recovered when all units included in the accounting quantity are delivered as the expected
unit cost for later deliveries is below the estimated average cost of all units in the program. Supplier advances
represent payments for parts we have contracted to receive from suppliers in the future. As parts are received, supplier
advances are amortized to work in process.
The determination of net realizable value of long-term contract costs is based upon quarterly reviews that estimate
costs to be incurred to complete all contract requirements. When actual contract costs and the estimate to complete
exceed total estimated contract revenues, a loss provision is recorded. The determination of net realizable value of
commercial aircraft program costs is based upon quarterly program reviews that estimate revenue and cost to be
incurred to complete the program accounting quantity. When estimated costs to complete exceed estimated program
revenues to go, a program loss provision is recorded in the current period for the estimated loss on all undelivered units
in the accounting quantity.
60
Table of Contents
Used aircraft purchased by the Commercial Airplanes segment and general stock materials are stated at cost not in
excess of net realizable value. See ‘Aircraft Valuation’ within this Note for a discussion of our valuation of used aircraft.
Spare parts inventory is stated at lower of average unit cost or net realizable value. We review our commercial spare
parts and general stock materials quarterly to identify impaired inventory, including excess or obsolete inventory, based
on historical sales trends, expected production usage, and the size and age of the aircraft fleet using the part. Impaired
inventories are charged to Cost of products in the period the impairment occurs.
Included in inventory for commercial aircraft programs are amounts paid or credited in cash, or other consideration to
certain airline customers, that are referred to as early issue sales consideration. Early issue sales consideration is
recognized as a reduction to revenue when the delivery of the aircraft under contract occurs. If an airline customer does
not perform and take delivery of the contracted aircraft, we believe that we would have the ability to recover amounts
paid. However, to the extent early issue sales consideration exceeds advances and is not considered to be otherwise
recoverable, it would be written off in the current period.
Precontract Costs
We may, from time to time, incur costs in excess of the amounts required for existing contracts. If we determine the
costs are probable of recovery from future orders, then we capitalize the precontract costs we incur, excluding start-up
costs which are expensed as incurred. Capitalized precontract costs are included in Inventories in the accompanying
Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Should future orders not materialize or we determine the costs are no
longer probable of recovery, the capitalized costs would be written off.
Property, Plant and Equipment
Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost, including applicable construction-period interest, less accumulated
depreciation and are depreciated principally over the following estimated useful lives: new buildings and land
improvements, from 10 to 40 years; and new machinery and equipment, from 4 to 20 years. The principal methods of
depreciation are as follows: buildings and land improvements, 150% declining balance; and machinery and equipment,
sum-of-the-years’ digits. Capitalized internal use software is included in Other assets and amortized using the straight
line method over 5 years. Capitalized software as a service is included in Other assets and amortized using the straight
line method over the term of the hosting arrangement which is typically no greater than 5 years. We periodically
evaluate the appropriateness of remaining depreciable lives assigned to long-lived assets, including assets that may be
subject to a management plan for disposition.
Long-lived assets held for sale are stated at the lower of cost or fair value less cost to sell. Long-lived assets held for
use are subject to an impairment assessment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
amount may not be recoverable. If the carrying value is no longer recoverable based upon the undiscounted future
cash flows of the asset, the amount of the impairment is the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value
of the asset.
Asset Retirement Obligations
We record all known asset retirement obligations for which the liability’s fair value can be reasonably estimated,
including certain asbestos removal, asset decommissioning and contractual lease restoration obligations. Recorded
amounts are not material.
We also have known conditional asset retirement obligations, such as certain asbestos remediation and asset
decommissioning activities to be performed in the future, that are not reasonably estimable due to insufficient
information about the timing and method of settlement of the obligation. Accordingly, these
61
Table of Contents
obligations have not been recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements. A liability for these obligations will be
recorded in the period when sufficient information regarding timing and method of settlement becomes available to
make a reasonable estimate of the liability’s fair value. In addition, there may be conditional asset retirement obligations
that we have not yet discovered (e.g. asbestos may exist in certain buildings but we have not become aware of it
through the normal course of business), and therefore, these obligations also have not been included in the
Consolidated Financial Statements.
Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangibles
Goodwill and other acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized, but are tested for impairment
annually and when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is more likely than not that an impairment
may exist. Our annual testing date is April 1.
We test goodwill for impairment by performing a qualitative assessment or using a two-step impairment process. If we
choose to perform a qualitative assessment and determine it is more likely than not that the carrying value of the net
assets is more than the fair value of the related operations, the two-step impairment process is then performed;
otherwise, no further testing is required. For operations where the two-step impairment process is used, we first
compare the carrying value of net assets to the fair value of the related operations. If the fair value is determined to be
less than carrying value, a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment. In this process, a fair
value for goodwill is estimated, based in part on the fair value of the operations, and is compared to its carrying value.
The shortfall of the fair value below carrying value represents the amount of goodwill impairment.
Indefinite-lived intangibles consist of brand and trade names acquired in business combinations. We test these
intangibles for impairment by comparing their carrying value to current projections of discounted cash flows attributable
to the brand and trade names. Any excess carrying value over the amount of discounted cash flows represents the
amount of the impairment.
Our finite-lived acquired intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives as
follows: developed technology, from 4 to 14 years; product know-how, from 6 to 30 years; customer base, from 3 to 17
years; distribution rights, from 3 to 27 years; and other, from 2 to 32 years. We evaluate the potential impairment of
finite-lived acquired intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount
may not be recoverable. If the carrying value is no longer recoverable based upon the undiscounted future cash flows
of the asset, the amount of the impairment is the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the
asset.
Investments
Time deposits are held-to-maturity investments that are carried at cost.
Available-for-sale debt securities include commercial paper, U.S. government agency securities, and corporate debt
securities. Available-for-sale debt securities are recorded at fair value, and unrealized gains and losses are recorded,
net of tax, as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Realized gains and losses on available-for-
sale debt securities are recognized based on the specific identification method. Available-for-sale debt securities are
assessed for impairment quarterly.
The equity method of accounting is used to account for investments for which we have the ability to exercise significant
influence, but not control, over an investee. Significant influence is generally deemed to exist if we have an ownership
interest in the voting stock of an investee of between 20% and 50%. The cumulative earnings approach is used for
cash flow classification of distributions received from equity method investments.
62
Table of Contents
Other Equity investments are recorded at fair value, with gains and losses recorded through net earnings. Equity
investments without readily determinable fair value are measured at cost, less impairments, plus or minus observable
price changes. Equity investments without readily determinable fair value are assessed for impairment quarterly.
We classify investment income and loss on our Consolidated Statements of Operations based on whether the
investment is operating or non-operating in nature. Operating investments align strategically and are integrated with our
operations. Earnings from operating investments, including our share of income or loss from equity method
investments, dividend income from other equity investments, and any impairments or gain/loss on the disposition of
these investments, are recorded in Income from operating investments, net. Non-operating investments are those we
hold for non-strategic purposes. Earnings from non-operating investments, including interest and dividends on
marketable securities, and any impairments or gain/loss on the disposition of these investments are recorded in Other
income/(loss), net.
Derivatives
All derivative instruments are recognized in the financial statements and measured at fair value regardless of the
purpose or intent of holding them. We use derivative instruments to principally manage a variety of market risks. For
derivatives designated as hedges of the exposure to changes in fair value of the recognized asset or liability or a firm
commitment (referred to as fair value hedges), the gain or loss is recognized in earnings in the period of change
together with the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the risk being hedged. The effect of that
accounting is to include in earnings the extent to which the hedge is not effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair
value. For our cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the derivative’s gain or loss is initially reported in
comprehensive income and is subsequently reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the
hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. The ineffective portion of the gain or loss of a cash flow hedge is
reported in earnings immediately. We have agreements to purchase and sell aluminum to address long-term strategic
sourcing objectives and international business requirements. These agreements are derivatives for accounting
purposes but are not designated for hedge accounting treatment. We also hold certain derivative instruments for
economic purposes that are not designated for hedge accounting treatment. For these aluminum agreements and for
other derivative instruments not designated for hedge accounting treatment, the changes in their fair value are recorded
in earnings immediately.
Aircraft Valuation
Used aircraft under trade-in commitments and aircraft under repurchase commitments In conjunction with
signing a definitive agreement for the sale of new aircraft (Sale Aircraft), we have entered into trade-in commitments
with certain customers that give them the right to trade in used aircraft at a specified price upon the purchase of Sale
Aircraft. Additionally, we have entered into contingent repurchase commitments with certain customers wherein we
agree to repurchase the Sale Aircraft at a specified price, generally 10 to 15 years after delivery of the Sale Aircraft. Our
repurchase of the Sale Aircraft is contingent upon a future, mutually acceptable agreement for the sale of additional
new aircraft. If we execute an agreement for the sale of additional new aircraft, and if the customer exercises its right to
sell the Sale Aircraft to us, a contingent repurchase commitment would become a trade-in commitment. Our historical
experience is that contingent repurchase commitments infrequently become trade-in commitments.
63
Table of Contents
Exposure related to trade-in commitments may take the form of:
(1)adjustments to revenue for the difference between the contractual trade-in price in the definitive agreement
and our best estimate of the fair value of the trade-in aircraft as of the date of such agreement, which would
be recognized upon delivery of the Sale Aircraft, and/or
(2)charges to cost of products for adverse changes in the fair value of trade-in aircraft that occur subsequent to
signing of a definitive agreement for Sale Aircraft but prior to the purchase of the used trade-in aircraft.
Estimates based on current aircraft values would be included in Accrued liabilities.
The fair value of trade-in aircraft is determined using aircraft-specific data such as model, age and condition, market
conditions for specific aircraft and similar models, and multiple valuation sources. This process uses our assessment of
the market for each trade-in aircraft, which in most instances begins years before the return of the aircraft. There are
several possible markets in which we continually pursue opportunities to place used aircraft. These markets include,
but are not limited to, the resale market, which could potentially include the cost of long-term storage; the leasing
market, with the potential for refurbishment costs to meet the leasing customer’s requirements; or the scrap market.
Trade-in aircraft valuation varies significantly depending on which market we determine is most likely for each aircraft.
On a quarterly basis, we update our valuation analysis based on the actual activities associated with placing each
aircraft into a market or using current published third-party aircraft valuations based on the type and age of the aircraft,
adjusted for individual attributes and known conditions.
Used aircraft acquired by the Commercial Airplanes segment are included in Inventories at the lower of cost or net
realizable value as it is our intent to sell these assets. To mitigate costs and enhance marketability, aircraft may be
placed on operating lease. While on operating lease, the assets are included in Customer financing.
Customer financing Customer financing includes operating lease equipment, notes receivable, and sales-type/finance
leases. Sales-type/finance leases are treated as receivables, and allowances for losses are established as necessary.
We assess the fair value of the assets we own, including equipment under operating leases, assets held for sale or re-
lease, and collateral underlying receivables, to determine if their fair values are less than the related assets’ carrying
values. Differences between carrying values and fair values of sales-type/finance leases and notes and other
receivables, as determined by collateral value, are considered in determining the allowance for losses on receivables.
We use a median calculated from published collateral values from multiple third-party aircraft value publications based
on the type and age of the aircraft to determine the fair value of aircraft. Under certain circumstances, we apply
judgment based on the attributes of the specific aircraft or equipment, usually when the features or use of the aircraft
vary significantly from the more generic aircraft attributes covered by outside publications.
Impairment review for assets under operating leases and held for sale or re-lease We evaluate for impairment
assets under operating lease or assets held for sale or re-lease when events or changes in circumstances indicate that
the expected undiscounted cash flow from the asset may be less than the carrying value. We use various assumptions
when determining the expected undiscounted cash flow, including our intentions for how long we will hold an asset
subject to operating lease before it is sold, the expected future lease rates, lease terms, residual value of the asset,
periods in which the asset may be held in preparation for a follow-on lease, maintenance costs, remarketing costs and
the remaining economic life of the asset. We record assets held for sale at the lower of carrying value or fair value less
costs to sell.
64
Table of Contents
When we determine that impairment is indicated for an asset, the amount of impairment expense recorded is the
excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the asset.
Allowance for losses on customer financing receivables We record the potential impairment of customer financing
receivables in a valuation account, the balance of which is an accounting estimate of probable but unconfirmed losses.
The allowance for losses on receivables relates to two components of receivables: (a) receivables that are evaluated
individually for impairment and (b) all other receivables.
We determine a receivable is impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be
unable to collect amounts due according to the original contractual terms of the receivable agreement, without regard to
any subsequent restructurings. Factors considered in assessing collectability include, but are not limited to, a
customer’s extended delinquency, requests for restructuring and filings for bankruptcy. We determine a specific
impairment allowance based on the difference between the carrying value of the receivable and the estimated fair value
of the related collateral we would expect to realize.
We review the adequacy of the allowance attributable to the remaining receivables (after excluding receivables subject
to a specific impairment allowance) by assessing both the collateral exposure and the applicable cumulative default
rate. Collateral exposure for a particular receivable is the excess of the carrying value of the receivable over the fair
value of the related collateral. A receivable with an estimated fair value in excess of the carrying value is considered to
have no collateral exposure. The applicable cumulative default rate is determined using two components: customer
credit ratings and weighted average remaining contract term. Internally assigned credit ratings, our credit quality
indicator, are determined for each customer in the portfolio. Those ratings are updated based upon public information
and information obtained directly from our customers.
We have entered into agreements with certain customers that would entitle us to look beyond the specific collateral
underlying the receivable for purposes of determining the collateral exposure as described above. Should the proceeds
from the sale of the underlying collateral asset resulting from a default condition be insufficient to cover the carrying
value of our receivable (creating a shortfall condition), these agreements would, for example, permit us to take the
actions necessary to sell or retain certain other assets in which the customer has an equity interest and use the
proceeds to cover the shortfall.
Each quarter we review customer credit ratings, published historical credit default rates for different rating categories,
and multiple third-party aircraft value publications as a basis to validate the reasonableness of the allowance for losses
on receivables. There can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from estimates or that the consideration of
these factors in the future will not result in an increase or decrease to the allowance for losses on receivables.
Warranties
In conjunction with certain product sales, we provide warranties that cover factors such as non-conformance to
specifications and defects in material and design. The majority of our warranties are issued by our Commercial
Airplanes segment. Generally, aircraft sales are accompanied by a 3 to 4-year standard warranty for systems,
accessories, equipment, parts, and software manufactured by us or manufactured to certain standards under our
authorization. These warranties are included in the programs’ estimate at completion. On occasion we have made
commitments beyond the standard warranty obligation to correct fleet-wide major issues of a particular model, resulting
in additional accrued warranty expense. Warranties issued by our BDS segment principally relate to sales of military
aircraft and weapons hardware and are included in the contract cost estimates. These sales are generally
accompanied by a six month to two-year warranty period and cover systems, accessories, equipment, parts, and
software manufactured by us to certain contractual specifications. Estimated costs related to standard warranties are
recorded in the period in which the related product delivery occurs. The warranty liability recorded at each balance
sheet date reflects the estimated number of months of warranty coverage outstanding for products delivered
65
Table of Contents
times the average of historical monthly warranty payments, as well as additional amounts for certain major warranty
issues that exceed a normal claims level. Estimated costs of these additional warranty issues are considered changes
to the initial liability estimate.
We provide guarantees to certain commercial airplane customers which include compensation provisions for failure to
meet specified aircraft performance targets. We account for these performance guarantees as warranties. The
estimated liability for these warranties is based on known and anticipated operational characteristics and forecasted
customer operation of the aircraft relative to contractually specified performance targets, and anticipated settlements
when contractual remedies are not specified. Estimated payments are recorded as a reduction of revenue at delivery of
the related aircraft. We have agreements that require certain suppliers to compensate us for amounts paid to
customers for failure of supplied equipment to meet specified performance targets. Claims against suppliers under
these agreements are included in Inventories and recorded as a reduction in Cost of products at delivery of the related
aircraft. These performance warranties and claims against suppliers are included in the programs’ estimate at
completion.
Supplier Penalties
We record an accrual for supplier penalties when an event occurs that makes it probable that a supplier penalty will be
incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable. Until an event occurs, we fully anticipate accepting all products
procured under production-related contracts.
Guarantees
We record a liability in Accrued liabilities for the fair value of guarantees that are issued or modified after December 31,
2002. For credit guarantees, the liability is equal to the present value of the expected loss. We determine the expected
loss by multiplying the creditor’s default rate by the guarantee amount reduced by the expected recovery, if applicable,
for each future period the credit guarantee will be outstanding. If at inception of a guarantee, we determine there is a
probable related contingent loss, we will recognize a liability for the greater of (a) the fair value of the guarantee as
described above or (b) the probable contingent loss amount.
Standards Issued and Not Yet Implemented
In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-02,
Leases (Topic 842). The new standard is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018 and early
adoption is permitted. The standard will require lessees to report most leases as assets and liabilities on the balance
sheet, while lessor accounting will remain substantially unchanged. The standard permits two approaches, one
requiring retrospective application of the new guidance with restatement of prior years, and one requiring prospective
application of the new guidance. We plan to adopt the new lease standard effective January 1, 2019 and apply it
prospectively. We do not expect the new lease standard to have a material effect on our financial position, results of
operations or cash flows.

Note 3 – Acquisitions and Joint Ventures
KLX Inc.
On October 9, 2018, we acquired all the outstanding shares of KLX Inc. (KLX). KLX is a global provider of aviation
parts and services in the aerospace industry. Its capabilities include distribution and supply chain services. The KLX
acquisition is intended to accelerate growth in our services business by allowing Boeing to offer commercial, defense,
business and general aviation customers a broader range of offerings. The results of KLX’s operations have been
included in our Global Services segment from the acquisition date. KLX’s revenues and earnings from operations from
October 9, 2018 through December 31, 2018 were $356 and $50.
The preliminary allocation of the purchase price was as follows:
Cash and cash equivalents $225
Accounts receivable 260
Inventories 1,321
Other current assets 41
Property, plant & equipment 36
Goodwill 2,110
Intangible assets 965
Other assets 65
Current liabilities (347)
Other long-term liabilities (180)
Long-term debt (1,210)
Total net assets acquired $3,286
The goodwill has been allocated to the Global Services and Commercial Airplanes segments based on revenue
synergies expected to be realized from the integration of KLX’s products and services and expected cost synergies
primarily resulting from the consolidation of procurement spending and functional support. Approximately $533 of the
acquired goodwill and intangible assets is deductible for tax purposes. The acquired intangible assets primarily relate to
customer and supplier relationships and have a weighted-average useful life of 17.5 years.
Strategic Partnership with Embraer
On July 5, 2018, we and Embraer S.A. (Embraer) announced the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding to
establish a strategic partnership between the two companies. On December 17, 2018, the terms of the strategic
partnership were agreed by both companies. The agreed terms define the joint venture comprising the commercial
aircraft and services operations of Embraer, in which Boeing will acquire an 80 percent ownership stake for $4.2 billion.
The companies have also agreed to the terms of another joint venture to promote and develop new markets for the
multi-mission medium airlift KC-390, in which Boeing will hold a 49 percent ownership stake. On January 10, 2019, the
Government of Brazil reviewed the terms of the strategic partnership and advised it would not exercise its Golden
Share veto power, allowing the transaction to move forward. On January 11, 2019, the Embraer Board of Directors
ratified its prior approval of the strategic partnership and authorized execution of the definitive transaction documents.
On January 24, 2019, the definitive transaction documents were executed. The transaction remains subject to Embraer
shareholder and regulatory approvals, as well as other customary closing conditions. Assuming approvals are received
in a timely manner, the transaction is intended to close by
71

the end of 2019. If the transaction is not completed due to failure to obtain antitrust approvals, we would be required to
pay a termination fee of $100.

Note 5 – Earnings Per Share
Basic and diluted earnings per share are computed using the two-class method, which is an earnings allocation method
that determines earnings per share for common shares and participating securities. The undistributed earnings are
allocated between common shares and participating securities as if all earnings had been distributed during the period.
Participating securities and common shares have equal rights to undistributed earnings.
Basic earnings per share is calculated by taking net earnings, less earnings available to participating securities, divided
by the basic weighted average common shares outstanding.
Diluted earnings per share is calculated by taking net earnings, less earnings available to participating securities,
divided by the diluted weighted average common shares outstanding.
The elements used in the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share were as follows:
(In millions - except per share amounts)    
Years ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016
Net earnings $10,460 $8,458 $5,034

restricted stock units and performance awards.
The following table includes the number of shares that may be dilutive potential common shares in the future. These
shares were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because the effect was either antidilutive or
the performance condition was not met.

Total income tax expense $1,144 $1,649 $749
Net income tax payments were $1,326, $896 and $1,460 in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
The following is a reconciliation of the U.S. federal statutory tax rate to our effective income tax rates:
Years ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016
U.S. federal statutory tax 21.0 % 35.0 % 35.0 %
Foreign derived intangible income(1)(4.7)
Federal audit settlements(2)(3.6) (3.1)
Research and development credits (1.8) (1.6) (5.0)
Excess tax benefits(3)(1.6) (2.1) (1.8)
Other provision adjustments 1.3 (0.2) (0.3)
Impact of Tax Cuts and Jobs Act(4)(1.0) (12.6)  
Tax on non-US activities 0.3 (0.9) (0.5)
Tax basis adjustment(5)(7.6)
U.S. manufacturing activity tax benefit (1.3) (3.7)
Effective income tax rate 9.9 % 16.3 % 13.0 %
(1) On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) was enacted. The TCJA revised the U.S. corporate
income tax by, among other things, lowering the rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, implementing a
territorial tax system and imposing a one-time tax on deemed repatriated earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries. The
TCJA also enacted provisions which effectively apply a lower U.S. tax rate to intangible income derived from
serving non-U.S. markets. In 2018, we recorded a $549 tax benefit related to foreign derived intangible income.
(2) In the third quarter of 2018, we recorded a tax benefit of $412 related to the settlement of the 2013-2014
74
Table of Contents
federal tax audit. In the third quarter of 2016, a tax benefit of $177 was recorded related to the settlement of the
2011-2012 federal tax audit.
(3) In 2018, 2017 and 2016, we recorded excess tax benefits related to employee share-based payments of $181,
$207 and $105.
(4) In accordance with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (SAB 118), in the
fourth quarter of 2017, we recorded provisional tax benefits of $1,430 related to the remeasurement of our net U.S.
deferred tax liabilities to reflect the reduction in the corporate tax rate and a provisional tax expense of $159 related
to tax on non-U.S. activities resulting from the TCJA. During the fourth quarter of 2018 and in accordance with SAB
118, the Company completed its accounting for the provisional amounts recognized at December 31, 2017 and
recorded an incremental benefit related to refinements to these provisional amounts which was not significant.
(5) In the third quarter of 2016, we recorded incremental tax benefits of $440 related to the application of a 2012
Federal Court of Claims decision which held that the tax basis in certain assets could be increased (tax basis
adjustment).
Significant components of our deferred tax (liabilities)/assets at December 31 were as follows:
 2018 2017
Inventory and long-term contract methods of income recognition (5,422) (6,459)
Pension benefits 3,344 3,565
Fixed assets, intangibles and goodwill (net of valuation allowance of $16 and $16) (1,616) (1,253)
Retiree health care benefits 1,124 1,304
Other employee benefits 873 847
Accrued expenses and reserves 411 334
Customer and commercial financing (309) (369)
Net operating loss, credit and capital loss carryovers (net of valuation allowance of $77
and $53)(1)258 299
Other (115) (135)
Net deferred tax (liabilities)/assets(2)($1,452) ($1,867)
(1)  Of the deferred tax asset for net operating loss and credit carryovers, $244 expires on or before December 31,
2037 and $14 may be carried over indefinitely.
(2)  Included in the net deferred tax (liabilities)/assets as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 are deferred tax assets in the
amounts of $4,275 and $4,636 related to Accumulated other comprehensive loss.
Net deferred tax (liabilities)/assets at December 31 were as follows:
2018 2017
Deferred tax assets $8,835 $8,399
Deferred tax liabilities (10,194) (10,197)
Valuation allowance (93) (69)
Net deferred tax (liabilities)/assets ($1,452) ($1,867)
The deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if, based upon available evidence, it is more likely than
not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
In accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Company has made an accounting policy election to treat Global Intangible Low
Tax Income (GILTI) as a current year tax expense in the period in which it is incurred.
75
Table of Contents
Therefore, we have not provided any deferred tax impacts of GILTI in our Consolidated Financial Statements for the
year ended December 31, 2018.
The TCJA one-time repatriation tax and GILTI liabilities effectively taxed the undistributed earnings previously deferred
from U.S. income taxes. We have not provided for foreign withholding tax on the undistributed earnings from our non-
U.S. subsidiaries because such earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested. If such earnings were to be
distributed, any foreign withholding tax would not be significant.
As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the amounts accrued for the payment of income tax-related interest and penalties
included in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position were not significant. The amounts of interest included in
the Consolidated Statements of Operations were not significant for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and
2016.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:
 2018 2017 2016
Unrecognized tax benefits – January 1 $1,736 $1,557 $1,617
Gross increases – tax positions in prior periods 87 3 17
Gross decreases – tax positions in prior periods (410) (44) (348)
Gross increases – current-period tax positions 1,208 220 344
Settlements (206)  (73)
Statute Lapse (3)  
Unrecognized tax benefits – December 31 $2,412 $1,736 $1,557
As of December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits was $2,412, $1,736 and
$1,557, respectively, of which $1,405, $1,568 and $1,402 would affect the effective tax rate, if recognized. As of
December 31, 2018, these amounts are primarily associated with uncertainties in the TCJA and the amount of research
tax credits claimed. Also included in these amounts are accruals for domestic state tax issues such as the allocation of
income among various state tax jurisdictions and the amount of state tax credits claimed.
Federal income tax audits have been settled for all years prior to 2015. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is expected
to begin the 2015-2017 federal tax audit in the first quarter of 2019. We are also subject to examination in major state
and international jurisdictions for the 2001-2017 tax years. We believe appropriate provisions for all outstanding tax
issues have been made for all jurisdictions and all open years.
Audit outcomes and the timing of audit settlements are subject to significant uncertainty. It is reasonably possible that
within the next 12 months unrecognized tax benefits related to state matters under audit may decrease by up to $460
based on current estimates.

Note 9– Contracts with Customers
Unbilled receivables increased from $8,194 at December 31, 2017 to $10,025 at December 31, 2018, primarily driven
by revenue recognized at BDS, BGS and BCA in excess of billings.
Advances and progress billings increased from $48,042 at December 31, 2017 to $50,676 at December 31, 2018,
primarily driven by advances on orders received in excess of revenue recognized at BCA.
Revenues recognized for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 from amounts recorded as Advances and
progress billings at the beginning of each year were $24,737 and $22,796.
The following table summarizes our contract assets under long-term contracts that were unbillable or related to

subject to uncertainty concerning their determination or ultimate realization.
Note 10 – Customer Financing
Customer financing primarily relates to our BCC segment. Prior period amounts have been adjusted to conform with
the current year presentation as a result of the adoption of Topic 606. Customer financing consisted of the following at

The components of investment in sales-type/finance leases at December 31 were as follows:
 2018 2017
Minimum lease payments receivable $908 $1,159
Estimated residual value of leased assets 425 495
Unearned income (208) (290)
Total $1,125 $1,364
Operating lease equipment primarily includes large commercial jet aircraft.
Financing receivable balances evaluated for impairment at December 31 were as follows:
 2018 2017
Individually evaluated for impairment $409 $422
Collectively evaluated for impairment 1,446 1,964
Total financing receivables $1,855 $2,386
We determine a receivable is impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be
unable to collect amounts due according to the original contractual terms. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, we
individually evaluated for impairment customer financing receivables of $409 and $422, of which $398 and $411 were
determined to be impaired. We recorded no allowance for losses on these impaired receivables as the collateral values
exceeded the carrying values of the receivables.
Income recognition is generally suspended for financing receivables at the date full recovery of income and principal
becomes not probable. Income is recognized when financing receivables become contractually current and
performance is demonstrated by the customer. The average recorded investment in impaired financing receivables for
the year ended December 31, 2018 was $403, and the related interest income was insignificant.
The change in the allowance for losses on financing receivables for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and
2016, consisted of the following:
 2018 2017 2016
Beginning balance - January 1 ($12) ($10) ($16)
Customer financing valuation benefit/(cost) 3 (2) 6
Ending balance - December 31 ($9) ($12) ($10)
Collectively evaluated for impairment ($9) ($12) ($10)
The adequacy of the allowance for losses is assessed quarterly. Three primary factors influencing the level of our
allowance for losses on customer financing receivables are customer credit ratings, default rates and collateral values.
We assign internal credit ratings for all customers and determine the creditworthiness of each customer based upon
publicly available information and information obtained directly from our customers. Our rating categories are
comparable to those used by the major credit rating agencies.
79
Table of Contents
Our financing receivable balances at December 31 by internal credit rating category are shown below:
Rating categories 2018 2017
BBB $883 $1,170
BB 430 627
B 135 177
CCC 407 412
Total carrying value of financing receivables $1,855 $2,386
At December 31, 2018, our allowance related to receivables with ratings of B, BB and BBB. We applied default rates
that averaged 22.8%, 6.5% and 0.7%, respectively, to the exposure associated with those receivables.
Customer Financing Exposure
Customer financing is collateralized by security in the related asset. The value of the collateral is closely tied to
commercial airline performance and overall market conditions and may be subject to reduced valuation with market
decline. Declines in collateral values could result in asset impairments, reduced finance lease income, and an increase
in the allowance for losses. Our customer financing collateral is concentrated in 747-8 and out-of-production aircraft.
Generally, out-of-production aircraft have experienced greater collateral value declines than in-production aircraft.
The majority of customer financing carrying values are concentrated in the following aircraft models at December 31:
 2018 2017
717 Aircraft ($204 and $269 accounted for as operating leases) $918 $1,081
747-8 Aircraft ($132 and $138 accounted for as operating leases) 477 483
737 Aircraft ($263 and $127 Accounted for as operating leases) 290 161
MD-80 Aircraft (Accounted for as sales-type finance leases) 204 231
757 Aircraft ($24 and $27 accounted for as operating leases) 200 217
747-400 Aircraft ($45 and $88 Accounted for as operating leases) 116 170
777 Aircraft ($60 and $0 accounted for as operating leases) 68 14
767 Aircraft ($0 and $25 accounted for as operating leases)  98
Charges related to customer financing asset impairment for the years ended December 31 were as follows:

Customer Financing included $250 of lease incentives with one customer that is currently experiencing liquidity issues
and is seeking additional capital. Should the customer fail to address its liquidity issues the lease incentive asset could
become impaired, and we could incur charges of up to $250.

Rental expense for leased properties was $307, $283 and $287, for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and
2016, respectively. At December 31, 2018, minimum rental payments under capital leases aggregated $164. Minimum
rental payments under operating leases with initial or remaining terms of one year or more aggregated $1,838, net of
sublease payments of $12 at December 31, 2018. Payments due under operating and capital leases net of sublease
amounts and non-cancellable future rentals during the next five years are as follows:
 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023
Minimum operating lease payments, net of sublease amounts $272 $232 $194 $165 $126
Minimum capital lease payments 58 45 30 16 4
Accounts payable related to purchases of property, plant and equipment were $338 and $196 for the years ended
December 31, 2018 and 2017.

Note 13 – Other Assets
Sea Launch
At December 31, 2018 and 2017, Other assets included $244 and $356 of receivables related to our former investment
in the Sea Launch venture which became payable by certain Sea Launch partners following Sea Launch’s bankruptcy
filing in June 2009. The net amounts owed to Boeing by each of the partners are as follows: S.P. Koroley Rocket and
Space Corporation Energia of Russia (RSC Energia) – $111, PO Yuzhnoye Mashinostroitelny Zavod of Ukraine – $89
and KB Yuzhnoye of Ukraine – $44.
In 2013, we filed an action in the United States District Court for the Central District of California seeking
reimbursement from the other Sea Launch partners. In 2016, the United States District Court for the Central District of
California issued a judgment in favor of Boeing. Later that year, we reached an agreement which we believe will enable
us to recover the outstanding receivable balance from RSC Energia over the next several years. We continue to pursue
collection efforts against the former Ukrainian partners in connection with the court judgment. We continue to believe
the partners have the financial wherewithal to pay and intend to pursue vigorously all of our rights and remedies. In the
event we are unable to secure reimbursement from RSC Energia and the Ukrainian Sea Launch partners, we could
incur additional charges.

Spirit AeroSystems
At December 31, 2017, Other assets included $137 of receivables related to indemnifications from Spirit AeroSystems,
Inc. (Spirit) for costs incurred related to pension and retiree medical obligations of former Boeing employees who were
subsequently employed by Spirit. On July 12, 2018, the Delaware Supreme Court denied Boeing’s claim for
indemnification. As a result, in the second quarter we wrote off the receivables attributable to the Spirit indemnifications.

Beginning balance – January 1 $524 $562
Reductions for payments made (37) (45)

Ending balance – December 31 $555 $524
The liabilities recorded represent our best estimate or the low end of a range of reasonably possible costs expected to
be incurred to remediate sites, including operation and maintenance over periods of up to 30 years. It is reasonably
possible that we may incur charges that exceed these recorded amounts because of regulatory agency orders and
directives, changes in laws and/or regulations, higher than expected costs and/or the discovery of new or additional
contamination. As part of our estimating process, we develop a range of reasonably possible alternate scenarios that
includes the high end of a range of reasonably possible cost estimates for all remediation sites for which we have
sufficient information based on our experience and existing laws and regulations. There are some potential remediation
obligations where the costs of remediation cannot be reasonably estimated. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, the high
end of the estimated range of reasonably possible remediation costs exceeded our recorded liabilities by $796 and
$868.

Commercial Aircraft Commitments
In conjunction with signing definitive agreements for the sale of new aircraft (Sale Aircraft), we have entered into trade-
in commitments with certain customers that give them the right to trade in used aircraft at a specified price upon the
purchase of Sale Aircraft. The probability that trade-in commitments will be exercised is determined by using both
quantitative information from valuation sources and qualitative information from other sources. The probability of
exercise is assessed quarterly, or as events trigger a change, and takes into consideration the current economic and
airline industry environments. Trade-in commitments, which can be terminated by mutual consent with the customer,
may be exercised only during the period specified in the agreement, and require advance notice by the customer.
Trade-in commitment agreements at December 31, 2018 have expiration dates from 2019 through 2026. At December
31, 2018 and 2017, total contractual trade-in commitments were $1,519 and $1,462. As of December 31, 2018 and
2017, we estimated that it was probable we would be obligated to perform on certain of these commitments with net
amounts payable to customers totaling $522 and $155 and the fair value of the related trade-in aircraft was $485 and
$155.
Financing Commitments
Financing commitments related to aircraft on order, including options and those proposed in sales campaigns, and
refinancing of delivered aircraft, totaled $19,462 and $10,221 as of December 31, 2018 and 2017. The estimated
earliest potential funding dates for these commitments as of December 31, 2018 are as follows:
 Total
2019 $2,331
2020 3,432
2021 2,784
2022 1,787
2023 3,402
Thereafter 5,726
 $19,462
As of December 31, 2018, $18,785 of these financing commitments related to customers we believe have less than
investment-grade credit. We have concluded that no reserve for future potential losses is required for these financing
commitments based upon the terms, such as collateralization and interest rates, under which funding would be
provided.

Standby Letters of Credit and Surety Bonds
We have entered into standby letters of credit and surety bonds with financial institutions primarily relating to the
guarantee of our future performance on certain contracts. Contingent liabilities on outstanding letters of credit
agreements and surety bonds aggregated approximately $3,761 and $3,708 as of December 31, 2018 and 2017.
Company Owned Life Insurance
McDonnell Douglas Corporation insured its executives with Company Owned Life Insurance (COLI), which are life
insurance policies with a cash surrender value. Although we do not use COLI currently, these obligations from the
merger with McDonnell Douglas are still a commitment at this time. We have loans in place to cover costs paid or
incurred to carry the underlying life insurance policies. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the cash surrender value
was $466 and $489 and the total loans were $447 and $470. As we have the right to offset the loans against the cash
surrender value of the policies, we present the net asset in Other assets on the Consolidated Statements of Financial
Position as of December 31, 2018 and 2017.
United States Government Defense Environment Overview
The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, passed in February 2018, raised the 2011 Budget Control Act spending caps for
fiscal years 2018 and 2019 (FY18 and FY19). The consolidated spending bills signed into law in September 2018
provide defense funding for FY19, in compliance with the revised caps. These bills also provide FY19 appropriations for
most of the federal government. Full year funding for the departments and agencies not covered by enacted FY19
appropriations, including the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA), remains uncertain. The unfunded departments and agencies affected by the partial government
shutdown (December 22, 2018 through January 25, 2019) are now covered by a Continuing Resolution that extends
funding at FY18 levels through February 15, 2019. Congress and the President must agree to FY19 appropriations or
an additional Continuing Resolution to fund affected departments and agencies beyond the February 15 deadline in
order to prevent a second partial government shutdown. The impact of a partial government shutdown to the
Company’s operations would increase as the shutdown continues. 
There continues to be uncertainty with respect to future program-level appropriations for the U.S. DoD and other
government agencies, including NASA. The 2011 Budget Control Act continues to mandate limits on U.S. government
discretionary spending for fiscal years 2020 and 2021 (FY20 and FY21). The lower budget caps will take effect again in
FY20 and FY21 unless Congress acts to raise the spending caps or to repeal or suspend the law. As a result,
continued budget uncertainty and the risk of future sequestration cuts remain. Future budget cuts or investment priority
changes could result in reductions, cancellations and/or delays of existing contracts or programs. Any of these impacts
could have a material effect on the results of the Company’s operations, financial position and/or cash flows.
BDS Fixed-Price Development Contracts
Fixed-price development work is inherently uncertain and subject to significant variability in estimates of the cost and
time required to complete the work. BDS fixed-price contracts with significant development work include Commercial
Crew, Saudi F-15, USAF KC-46A Tanker, T-X Trainer, VC-25B Presidential Aircraft, MQ-25 Stingray, and commercial
and military satellites. The operational and technical complexities of these contracts create financial risk, which could
trigger termination provisions, order cancellations or other financially significant exposure. Changes to cost and
revenue estimates could result in lower margins or material charges for reach-forward losses. For example, we have
recorded reach-forward losses on the KC-46A Tanker in 2018 as well as in prior years, and we continue to have risk for
further losses if we experience further production, technical or quality issues, and delays in flight testing, certification
and/or
85
Table of Contents
delivery. In addition, in 2018, in connection with winning the T-X Trainer and MQ-25 Stingray competitions, we recorded
a loss of $400 associated with options for 346 T-X Trainer aircraft and a loss of $291 related to the MQ-25 Stingray
Engineering, Manufacturing and Development (EMD) contract. Moreover, our fixed-price development programs remain
subject to additional reach-forward losses if we experience further technical or quality issues, schedule delays, or
increased costs. 
KC-46A Tanker
In 2011, we were awarded a contract from the U.S. Air Force (USAF) to design, develop, manufacture and deliver four
next generation aerial refueling tankers. This EMD contract is a fixed-price incentive fee contract valued at $4.9 billion
and involves highly complex designs and systems integration. In 2016, the USAF authorized two LRIP lots for 7 and 12
aircraft valued at $2.8 billion and in 2017, the USAF authorized an additional LRIP lot for 15 aircraft valued at $2.1
billion. On September 10, 2018, the USAF authorized an additional LRIP lot for 18 aircraft valued at $2.9 billion. In
January 2019, we delivered the first KC-46A Tanker to the USAF.
At December 31, 2018, we had approximately $370 of capitalized precontract costs and $550 of potential termination
liabilities to suppliers.
Recoverable Costs on Government Contracts
Our final incurred costs for each year are subject to audit and review for allowability by the U.S. government, which can
result in payment demands related to costs they believe should be disallowed. We work with the U.S. government to
assess the merits of claims and where appropriate reserve for amounts disputed. If we are unable to satisfactorily
resolve disputed costs, we could be required to record an earnings charge and/or provide refunds to the U.S.
government.
Note 15 – Arrangements with Off-Balance Sheet Risk
We enter into arrangements with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business, primarily in the form of
guarantees.
The following table provides quantitative data regarding our third party guarantees. The maximum potential payments
represent a “worst-case scenario,” and do not necessarily reflect amounts that we expect to pay. Estimated proceeds
from collateral and recourse represent the anticipated values of assets we could liquidate or receive from other parties
to offset our payments under guarantees. The carrying amount of liabilities represents the amount included in Accrued
liabilities.

proceeds from collateral/recourse in the table above represent the lower of the contracted repurchase price or the
expected fair value of each aircraft at the specified repurchase date.
Indemnifications to ULA In 2006, we agreed to indemnify ULA through December 31, 2020 against potential non-
recoverability and non-allowability of $1,360 of Boeing Delta launch program inventory included in contributed assets
plus $1,860 of inventory subject to an inventory supply agreement which ends on March 31, 2021. See Note 8. ULA
has yet to consume $52 of contributed inventory.
We also agreed to indemnify ULA for up to $261 in the event ULA was unable to obtain sufficient additional contract
pricing from the USAF for certain satellite missions. In the fourth quarter of 2018, ULA and the USAF entered into a
settlement agreement which resulted in the USAF making a payment of $240 to ULA.
Potential payments for Other Delta contracts include $85 related to deferred support costs and $91 related to deferred
production costs. In June 2011, the Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA) notified ULA that it had determined
that $271 of deferred support costs are not recoverable under government contracts. In December 2011, the DCMA
notified ULA of the potential non-recoverability of an additional $114 of deferred production costs. ULA and Boeing
believe that all costs are recoverable and in November 2011, ULA filed a certified claim with the USAF for collection of
deferred support and production costs. The USAF issued a final decision denying ULA’s certified claim in May 2012. In
2012, Boeing and ULA, through its subsidiary United Launch Services, filed a suit in the Court of Federal Claims
seeking recovery of the deferred support and production costs from the U.S. government, which subsequently asserted
a counterclaim for credits that it alleges were offset by deferred support cost invoices. We believe that the U.S.
government’s counterclaim is without merit. The discovery phase of the litigation completed in 2017. Boeing filed a
motion on November 17, 2017, asking the court to award full recovery without a trial. The court denied Boeing’s motion
on August 29, 2018. The court has entered the parties’ proposed pre-trial schedule providing for a final pre-trial
conference on or before October 17, 2019. If, contrary to our belief, it is determined that some or all of the deferred
support or production costs are not recoverable, we could be required to record pre-tax losses and make
indemnification payments to ULA for up to $317 of the costs questioned by the DCMA.
Other Indemnifications In conjunction with our sales of Electron Dynamic Devices, Inc. and Rocketdyne Propulsion
and Power businesses and our BCA facilities in Wichita, Kansas and Tulsa and McAlester, Oklahoma, we agreed to
indemnify, for an indefinite period, the buyers for costs relating to pre-closing environmental conditions and certain
other items. We are unable to assess the potential number of future claims that may be asserted under these
indemnifications, nor the amounts thereof (if any). As a result, we cannot estimate the maximum potential amount of
future payments under these indemnities and therefore, no liability has been recorded. To the extent that claims have
been made under these indemnities and/or are probable and reasonably estimable, liabilities associated with these
indemnities are included in the environmental liability disclosure in Note 14.
Credit Guarantees We have issued credit guarantees where we are obligated to make payments to a guaranteed
party in the event that the original lessee or debtor does not make payments or perform certain specified services.
Generally, these guarantees have been extended on behalf of guaranteed parties with less than investment-grade
credit and are collateralized by certain assets. Current outstanding credit guarantees expire through 2036.

Industrial Revenue Bonds
Industrial Revenue Bonds (IRB) issued by St. Louis County were used to finance the purchase and/or construction of
real and personal property at our St. Louis site. Tax benefits associated with IRBs include a twelve-year property tax
abatement and sales tax exemption from St. Louis County. We record these properties on our Consolidated Statements
of Financial Position. We have also purchased the IRBs and therefore are the bondholders as well as the
borrower/lessee of the properties purchased with the IRB proceeds. The liabilities and IRB assets are equal and are
reported net in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.
As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the assets and liabilities associated with the IRBs were $271 and $166.
Note 16 – Debt
On February 23, 2018, we issued $1,400 of fixed rate senior notes consisting of $350 due March 1, 2023 that bear an
annual interest rate of 2.8%, $350 due March 1, 2028 that bear an annual interest rate of 3.25%, $350 due
March 1, 2038 that bear an annual interest rate of 3.55%, and $350 due March 1, 2048 that bear an annual interest
rate of 3.625%. The notes are unsecured senior obligations and rank equally in right of payment with our existing and
future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The net proceeds of the issuance totaled $1,338, after deducting
underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses.
On October 31, 2018, we issued $700 of fixed rate senior notes consisting of $350 due November 1, 2028 that bear an
annual interest rate of 3.45%, and $350 due November 1, 2048 that bear an annual interest rate of 3.85%. The notes
are unsecured senior obligations and rank equally in right of payment with our existing and future unsecured and
unsubordinated indebtedness. The net proceeds of the issuance totaled $663, after deducting underwriting discounts,
commissions and offering expenses.
Interest incurred, including amounts capitalized, was $624, $541 and $535 for the years ended December 31, 2018,
2017 and 2016, respectively. Interest expense recorded by BCC is reflected as Boeing Capital interest expense on our
Consolidated Statements of Operations. Total Company interest payments were $616, $527 and $523 for the years
ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
We have $5,120 currently available under credit line agreements, of which $2,610 is a 364-day revolving credit facility
expiring in October, 2019 and $2,510 expires in October, 2023. The 364-day credit facility has a one-year term out
option which allows us to extend the maturity of any borrowings one year beyond the aforementioned expiration date.
We continue to be in full compliance with all covenants contained in our debt or credit facility agreements.

Note 17 – Postretirement Plans
The majority of our employees have earned benefits under defined benefit pension plans. Nonunion and the majority of
union employees that had participated in defined benefit pension plans transitioned to a company-funded defined
contribution retirement savings plan in 2016. Additional union employees transitioned to company-funded defined
contribution retirement savings plans effective January 1, 2019.
We fund our major pension plans through trusts. Pension assets are placed in trust solely for the benefit of the plans’
participants, and are structured to maintain liquidity that is sufficient to pay benefit obligations as well as to keep pace
over the long-term with the growth of obligations for future benefit payments.
We also have other postretirement benefits (OPB) other than pensions which consist principally of health care
coverage for eligible retirees and qualifying dependents, and to a lesser extent, life insurance to certain groups of
retirees. Retiree health care is provided principally until age 65 for approximately half those retirees who are eligible for
health care coverage. Certain employee groups, including employees covered by most United Auto Workers bargaining
agreements, are provided lifetime health care coverage.
89
Table of Contents
The funded status of the plans is measured as the difference between the plan assets at fair value and the projected
benefit obligation (PBO). We have recognized the aggregate of all overfunded plans in Other assets, and the aggregate
of all underfunded plans in either Accrued retiree health care or Accrued pension plan liability, net. The portion of the
amount by which the actuarial present value of benefits included in the PBO exceeds the fair value of plan assets,
payable in the next 12 months, is reflected in Accrued liabilities.

2017. Key information for our plans with ABO and PBO in excess of plan assets as of December 31 was as follows:
2018 2017
Accumulated benefit obligation $66,306 $71,975
Fair value of plan assets 52,894 58,353
2018 2017
Projected benefit obligation $68,354 $74,953
Fair value of plan assets 52,894 58,353
Assumptions
The following assumptions, which are the weighted average for all plans, are used to calculate the benefit obligation at
December 31 of each year and the net periodic benefit cost for the subsequent year.
December 31, 2018 2017 2016
Discount rate:    
Pension 4.20% 3.60% 4.00%
Other postretirement benefits 4.00% 3.30% 3.70%
Expected return on plan assets 6.80% 6.80% 6.80%
Rate of compensation increase 5.30% 5.30% 4.40%
Interest crediting rates for cash balance plans 5.15% 5.15% 5.15%
The discount rate for each plan is determined based on the plans’ expected future benefit payments using a yield curve
developed from high quality bonds that are rated as Aa or better by at least half of the four rating agencies utilized as of
the measurement date. The yield curve is fitted to yields developed from bonds at various maturity points. Bonds with
the ten percent highest and the ten percent lowest yields are omitted. The present value of each plan’s benefits is
calculated by applying the discount rates to projected benefit cash flows.
The pension fund’s expected return on plan assets assumption is derived from a review of actual historical returns
achieved by the pension trust and anticipated future long-term performance of individual asset classes. While
consideration is given to recent trust performance and historical returns, the assumption represents a long-term,
prospective return. The expected return on plan assets component of the net periodic benefit cost for the upcoming
plan year is determined based on the expected return on plan assets assumption and the market-related value of plan
assets (MRVA). Since our adoption of the accounting standard for pensions in 1987, we have determined the MRVA
based on a five-year moving average of plan assets. As of December 31, 2018, the MRVA was approximately $3,435
more than the fair market value of assets.
Assumed health care cost trend rates were as follows:
December 31, 2018 2017 2016
Health care cost trend rate assumed next year 5.50% 6.00% 6.50%
Ultimate trend rate 4.50% 4.50% 5.00%
Year that trend reached ultimate rate 2021 2021 2021

Plan Assets
Investment Strategy The overall objective of our pension assets is to earn a rate of return over time to satisfy the
benefit obligations of the pension plans and to maintain sufficient liquidity to pay benefits and address other cash
requirements of the pension fund. Specific investment objectives for our long-term investment strategy include reducing
the volatility of pension assets relative to pension liabilities, achieving a competitive total investment return, achieving
diversification between and within asset classes and managing other risks. Investment objectives for each asset class
are determined based on specific risks and investment opportunities identified.
We periodically update our long-term, strategic asset allocations. We use various analytics to determine the optimal
asset mix and consider plan liability characteristics, liquidity characteristics, funding requirements, expected rates of
return and the distribution of returns. We identify investment benchmarks to evaluate performance for the asset classes
in the strategic asset allocation that are market-based and investable where possible. Actual allocations to each asset
class vary from target allocations due to periodic investment strategy changes, market value fluctuations, the length of
time it takes to fully implement investment allocation positions, and the timing of benefit payments and contributions.
Short-term investments and exchange-traded derivatives are used to rebalance the actual asset allocation to the target
asset allocation. The asset allocation is monitored and rebalanced periodically. The actual and target allocations by
asset class for the pension assets at December 31 were as follows:
 Actual Allocations Target Allocations
Asset Class 2018 2017 2018 2017
Fixed income 48% 46% 47% 47%
Global equity 28 31 29 29
Private equity 5 5 5 5
Real estate and real assets 9 8 9 9
Hedge funds 10 10 10 10
Total 100% 100% 100% 100%
Fixed income securities are invested primarily in a diversified portfolio of long duration instruments. Global equity
securities are invested in a diversified portfolio of U.S. and non-U.S. companies, across various industries and market
capitalizations.
Real estate and real assets include global private investments that may be held through an investment in a limited
partnership (LP) or other fund structures and publicly traded investments (such as Real Estate Investment Trusts
(REITs) in the case of real estate). Real estate includes, but is not limited to, investments in office, retail, apartment and
industrial properties. Real assets include, but are not limited to, investments in natural resources (such as energy,
farmland and timber), commodities and infrastructure. Private equity investment vehicles are primarily limited
partnerships (LPs) that mainly invest in U.S. and non-U.S. leveraged buyout, venture capital and special situation
strategies.
Hedge fund investments seek to capitalize on inefficiencies identified across and within different asset classes or
markets. Hedge fund strategy types include, but are not limited to directional, event driven, relative value, long-short
and multi-strategy.
Investment managers are retained for explicit investment roles specified by contractual investment guidelines. Certain
investment managers are authorized to use derivatives, such as equity or bond futures, swaps, options and currency
futures or forwards. Derivatives are used to achieve the desired market exposure of a security or an index, transfer
value-added performance between asset classes, achieve the desired currency exposure, adjust portfolio duration or
rebalance the total portfolio to the target asset allocation.

Table of Contents
As a percentage of total pension plan assets, derivative net notional amounts were 4.4% and 5.0% for fixed income,
including to-be-announced mortgage-backed securities and treasury forwards, and 5.5% and 6.9% for global equity
and commodities at December 31, 2018 and 2017.
In 2017, the Company contributed $3,500 of our common stock to the pension fund. An independent fiduciary was
retained to manage and liquidate the stock over time at its discretion. The liquidation of the common stock holdings was
completed in the fourth quarter of 2017.
Risk Management In managing the plan assets, we review and manage risk associated with funded status risk,
interest rate risk, market risk, counterparty risk, liquidity risk and operational risk. Liability matching and asset class
diversification are central to our risk management approach and are integral to the overall investment strategy. Further,
asset classes are constructed to achieve diversification by investment strategy, by investment manager, by industry or
sector and by holding. Investment manager guidelines for publicly traded assets are specified and are monitored
regularly through the custodian. Credit parameters for counterparties have been established for managers permitted to
trade over-the-counter derivatives. Valuation is governed through several types of procedures, including reviews of
manager valuation policies, custodian valuation processes, pricing vendor practices, pricing reconciliation, and periodic,
security-specific valuation testing.

Fair Value Measurements The following table presents our plan assets using the fair value hierarchy as of December
31, 2018 and 2017. The fair value hierarchy has three levels based on the reliability of the inputs used to determine fair
value. Level 1 refers to fair values determined based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. Level 2
refers to fair values estimated using significant other observable inputs, and Level 3 includes fair values estimated
using significant unobservable inputs.

Table of Contents
Fixed income securities are primarily valued upon a market approach, using matrix pricing and considering a security’s
relationship to other securities for which quoted prices in an active market may be available, or an income approach,
converting future cash flows to a single present value amount. Inputs used in developing fair value estimates include
reported trades, broker quotes, benchmark yields, and base spreads.
Common/collective/pooled funds are typically common or collective trusts valued at their NAVs that are calculated by
the investment manager or sponsor of the fund and have daily or monthly liquidity. Derivatives included in the table
above are over-the-counter and are primarily valued using an income approach with inputs that include benchmark
yields, swap curves, cash flow analysis, rating agency data and interdealer broker rates. Exchange-traded derivative
positions are reported in accordance with changes in daily variation margin which is settled daily and therefore reflected
in the payables and receivables portion of the table.
Cash equivalents and other short-term investments (which are used to pay benefits) are held in a separate account
which consists of a commingled fund (with daily liquidity) and separately held short-term securities and cash
equivalents. All of the investments in this cash vehicle are valued daily using a market approach with inputs that include
quoted market prices for similar instruments. In the event a market price is not available for instruments with an original
maturity of one year or less, amortized cost is used as a proxy for fair value. Common and preferred stock equity
securities are primarily valued using a market approach based on the quoted market prices of identical instruments.
Private equity and private debt NAV valuations are based on the valuation of the underlying investments, which include
inputs such as cost, operating results, discounted future cash flows and market based comparable data. For those
investments reported on a one-quarter lagged basis (primarily LPs) we use NAVs, adjusted for subsequent cash flows
and significant events.
Real estate and real asset NAV valuations are based on valuation of the underlying investments, which include inputs
such as cost, discounted future cash flows, independent appraisals and market based comparable data. For those
investments reported on a one-quarter lagged basis (primarily LPs) NAVs are adjusted for subsequent cash flows and
significant events. Publicly traded REITs and infrastructure stocks are valued using a market approach based on
quoted market prices of identical instruments. Exchange-traded commodities futures positions are reported in
accordance with changes in daily variation margin which is settled daily and therefore reflected in the payables and
receivables portion of the table.
Hedge fund NAVs are generally based on the valuation of the underlying investments. This is primarily done by
applying a market or income valuation methodology depending on the specific type of security or instrument held.
Investments in private equity, private debt, real estate, real assets, and hedge funds are primarily calculated and
reported by the General Partner (GP), fund manager or third party administrator. Additionally, some investments in fixed
income and equity are made via commingled vehicles and are valued in a similar fashion. Pension assets invested in
commingled and limited partnership structures rely on the NAV of these investments as the practical expedient for the
valuations.

OPB Plan Assets The majority of OPB plan assets are invested in a balanced index fund which is comprised of
approximately 60% equities and 40% debt securities. The index fund is valued using a market approach based on the
quoted market price of an identical instrument (Level 1). The expected rate of return on these assets does not have a
material effect on the net periodic benefit cost.

Cash Flows
Contributions Required pension contributions under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), as well
as rules governing funding of our non-US pension plans, are not expected to be significant in 2019. We do not expect
to make contributions to our pension plans in 2019.
Estimated Future Benefit Payments The table below reflects the total pension benefits expected to be paid from the
plans or from our assets, including both our share of the benefit cost and the participants’ share of the cost, which is
funded by participant contributions. OPB payments reflect our portion only.

Net other postretirement benefits $469 $469 $460 $458 $447 $1,976
Termination Provisions
Certain of the pension plans provide that, in the event there is a change in control of the Company which is not
approved by the Board of Directors and the plans are terminated within five years thereafter, the assets in the plan first
will be used to provide the level of retirement benefits required by ERISA, and then any surplus will be used to fund a
trust to continue present and future payments under the postretirement medical and life insurance benefits in our group
insurance benefit programs.
Should we terminate certain pension plans under conditions in which the plan’s assets exceed that plan’s obligations,
the U.S. government will be entitled to a fair allocation of any of the plan’s assets based on plan contributions that were
reimbursed under U.S. government contracts.
Defined Contribution Plans
We provide certain defined contribution plans to all eligible employees. The principal plans are the Company-sponsored
401(k) plans. The expense for these defined contribution plans was $1,480, $1,522 and $1,413 in 2018, 2017 and
2016, respectively.
Note 18 – Share-Based Compensation and Other Compensation Arrangements
Share-Based Compensation
Our 2003 Incentive Stock Plan, as amended and restated, permits awards of incentive and non-qualified stock options,
stock appreciation rights, restricted stock or units, performance shares, performance restricted stock or units,
performance units and other stock and cash-based awards to our employees, officers, directors, consultants, and
independent contractors. The aggregate number of shares of our stock authorized for issuance under the plan is
87,000,000.
Shares issued as a result of stock option exercises or conversion of stock unit awards will be funded out of treasury
shares, except to the extent there are insufficient treasury shares, in which case new shares will be issued. We believe
we currently have adequate treasury shares to satisfy these issuances during 2019.

Table of Contents
Share-based plans expense is primarily included in General and administrative expense since it is incentive
compensation issued primarily to our executives. The share-based plans expense and related income tax benefit were
as follows:

Stock Options
We discontinued granting options in 2014, replacing them with performance-based restricted stock units. Options
granted through January 2014 had an exercise price equal to the fair market value of our stock on the date of grant and
expire ten years after the date of grant. The stock options vested over a period of three years and were fully vested at
December 31, 2018.

December 31, 2018 and 2017. The grant date fair value of stock options vested during the year ended December 31,
2016 was $27.
Restricted Stock Units
In February 2018, 2017 and 2016, we granted to our executives 260,730, 523,835 and 777,837 restricted stock units
(RSUs) as part of our long-term incentive program with grant date fair values of $361.13, $178.72 and $117.50 per unit,
respectively. The RSUs granted under this program will vest and settle in common stock (on a one-for-one basis) on
the third anniversary of the grant date. If an executive terminates employment because of retirement, involuntary layoff,
disability, or death, the employee (or beneficiary) will receive a proration of stock units based on active employment
during the three-year service period. In all other cases, the RSUs will not vest and all rights to the stock units will
terminate. In addition to RSUs awarded under our long-term incentive program, we grant RSUs to certain executives
and employees to encourage retention or to reward various achievements. These RSUs are labeled other RSUs in the
table below. The fair values of all RSUs are estimated using the average of the high and low stock prices on the date of
grant.

Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units
Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units (PBRSUs) are stock units that pay out based on the Company’s total
shareholder return as compared to a group of peer companies over a three-year period. The award payout can range
from 0% to 200% of the initial PBRSU grant. PBRSUs granted in February 2017 and 2016 will not exceed 400% of the
initial value (excluding dividend equivalent credits). The PBRSUs granted under this program will vest at the payout
amount and settle in common stock (on a one-for-one basis) on the third anniversary of the grant date. If an executive
terminates employment because of retirement, involuntary layoff, disability, or death, the employee (or beneficiary)
remains eligible under the award and, if the award is earned, will receive a proration of stock units based on active
employment during the three-year service period. In all other cases, the PBRSUs will not vest and all rights to the stock
units will terminate.
In February 2018, 2017 and 2016, we granted to our executives 241,284, 492,273 and 721,176 PBRSUs as part of our
long-term incentive program. Compensation expense for the award is recognized over the three-year performance
period based upon the grant date fair value. The grant date fair values were estimated using a Monte-Carlo simulation
model with the assumptions presented below. The model includes no expected dividend yield as the units earn
dividend equivalents.

Other Compensation Arrangements
Performance Awards
Performance Awards are cash units that pay out based on the achievement of long-term financial goals at the end of a
three-year period. Each unit has an initial value of $100 dollars. The amount payable at the end of the three-year
performance period may be anywhere from $0 to $200 dollars per unit, depending on the Company’s performance
against plan for a three-year period. The Compensation Committee has the discretion to pay these awards in cash,
stock, or a combination of both after the three-year performance period. Compensation expense, based on the
estimated performance payout, is recognized ratably over the performance period.
During 2018, 2017 and 2016, we granted Performance Awards to our executives as part of our long-term incentive
program with the payout based on the achievement of financial goals for each three-year period following the grant
date. The minimum payout amount is $0 and the maximum amount we could be required to pay out for the 2018, 2017
and 2016 Performance Awards is $369, $332 and $310, respectively. The 2016 grant is expected to be paid out in cash
in March 2019.
Deferred Compensation
The Company has deferred compensation plans which permit employees to defer a portion of their salary, bonus,
certain other incentive awards, and retirement contributions. Participants can diversify these amounts among 22
investment funds including a Boeing stock unit account.
Total expense related to deferred compensation was $19, $240 and $46 in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. As of
December 31, 2018 and 2017, the deferred compensation liability which is being marked to market was $1,572 and
$1,547.

Note 20 – Derivative Financial Instruments
Cash Flow Hedges
Our cash flow hedges include foreign currency forward contracts and commodity purchase contracts. We use foreign
currency forward contracts to manage currency risk associated with certain transactions, specifically forecasted sales
and purchases made in foreign currencies. Our foreign currency contracts hedge forecasted transactions through 2024.
We use commodity derivatives, such as fixed-price purchase commitments to hedge against potentially unfavorable
price changes for items used in production. Our commodity contracts hedge forecasted transactions through 2021.
Fair Value Hedges
Interest rate swaps under which we agree to pay variable rates of interest are designated as fair value hedges of fixed-
rate debt. The net change in fair value of the derivatives and the hedged items is reported in Boeing Capital interest
expense.

Derivative Instruments Not Receiving Hedge Accounting Treatment
We have entered into agreements to purchase and sell aluminum to address long-term strategic sourcing objectives
and non-U.S. business requirements. These agreements are derivative instruments for accounting purposes. The
quantities of aluminum in these agreements offset and are priced at prevailing market prices. We also hold certain
foreign currency forward contracts which do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment.

Table of Contents
We have derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features. For foreign exchange contracts with original
maturities of at least five years, our derivative counterparties could require settlement if we default on our five-year
credit facility. For certain commodity contracts, our counterparties could require collateral posted in an amount
determined by our credit ratings. The fair value of foreign exchange and commodity contracts that have credit-risk-
related contingent features that are in a net liability position at December 31, 2018 was $35. At December 31, 2018,
there was no collateral posted related to our derivatives.
Note 21 – Fair Value Measurements
The fair value hierarchy has three levels based on the reliability of the inputs used to determine fair value. Level 1
refers to fair values determined based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. Level 2 refers to fair
values estimated using significant other observable inputs, and Level 3 includes fair values estimated using significant
unobservable inputs. The following table presents our assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a
recurring basis and are categorized using the fair value hierarchy.

Derivatives ($112) ($112) ($13) ($13)
Total liabilities ($112) ($112) ($13) ($13)
Money market funds, available-for-sale debt investments and equity securities are valued using a market approach
based on the quoted market prices or broker/dealer quotes of identical or comparable instruments.
Derivatives include foreign currency, commodity and interest rate contracts. Our foreign currency forward contracts are
valued using an income approach based on the present value of the forward rate less the contract rate multiplied by the
notional amount. Commodity derivatives are valued using an income approach based on the present value of the
commodity index prices less the contract rate multiplied by the notional amount. The fair value of our interest rate
swaps is derived from a discounted cash flow analysis based on the terms of the contract and the interest rate curve.

Certain assets have been measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level
3). The following table presents the nonrecurring losses recognized for the years ended December 31 due to long-lived
asset impairment, and the fair value and asset classification of the related assets as of the impairment date:

Other assets and Acquired intangible assets 14 (23)
Property, plant and equipment 44 (4) 8 (2)
Total $145 ($93) $113 ($101)
Investments, Acquired intangible assets and Property, plant and equipment were primarily valued using an income
approach based on the discounted cash flows associated with the underlying assets. The fair value of the impaired
operating lease equipment is derived by calculating a median collateral value from a consistent group of third party
aircraft value publications. The values provided by the third party aircraft publications are derived from their knowledge
of market trades and other market factors. Management reviews the publications quarterly to assess the continued
appropriateness and consistency with market trends. Under certain circumstances, we adjust values based on the
attributes and condition of the specific aircraft or equipment, usually when the features or use of the aircraft vary
significantly from the more generic aircraft attributes covered by third party publications, or on the expected net sales
price for the aircraft.
For Level 3 assets that were measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis during the year ended December 31, 2018,
the following table presents the fair value of those assets as of the measurement date, valuation techniques and related
unobservable inputs of those assets.

adjustments based on consideration of individual aircraft attributes and condition. The positive amount represents
the sum of all such upward adjustments.

and commercial paper (10,380) (11,923)  (11,823) ($100)
The fair values of notes receivable are estimated with discounted cash flow analysis using interest rates currently
offered on loans with similar terms to borrowers of similar credit quality. The fair value of our debt that is traded in the
secondary market is classified as Level 2 and is based on current market yields. For our debt that is not traded in the
secondary market, the fair value is classified as Level 2 and is based on our indicative borrowing cost derived from
dealer quotes or discounted cash flows. The fair values of our debt classified as Level 3 are based on discounted cash
flow models using the implied yield from similar securities. With regard to other financial instruments with off-balance
sheet risk, it is not practicable to estimate the fair value of our indemnifications and financing commitments because the
amount and timing of those arrangements are uncertain. Items not included in the above disclosures include cash,
restricted cash, time deposits and other deposits, commercial paper, money market funds, Accounts receivable,
Unbilled receivables, Other current assets, Accounts payable and long-term payables. The carrying values of those
items, as reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position, approximate their fair value at December 31,
2018 and 2017. The fair value of assets and liabilities whose carrying value approximates fair value is determined using
Level 2 inputs, with the exception of cash (Level 1).
Note 22 – Legal Proceedings
Various legal proceedings, claims and investigations related to products, contracts, employment and other matters are
pending against us.
In addition, we are subject to various U.S. government inquiries and investigations from which civil, criminal or
administrative proceedings could result or have resulted in the past. Such proceedings involve or could involve claims
by the government for fines, penalties, compensatory and treble damages, restitution and/or forfeitures. Under
government regulations, a company, or one or more of its operating divisions or subdivisions, can also be suspended or
debarred from government contracts, or lose its export privileges, based on the results of investigations. We believe,
based upon current information, that the outcome of any such legal proceeding, claim, or government dispute and
investigation will not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

Note 23 – Segment and Revenue Information
Our primary profitability measurements to review a segment’s operating results are Earnings from operations and
operating margins. We operate in four reportable segments: BCA, BDS, BGS, and BCC. All other activities fall within
Unallocated items, eliminations and other. See page 53 for the Summary of Business Segment Data, which is an
integral part of this note.
BCA develops, produces and markets commercial jet aircraft principally to the commercial airline industry worldwide.
Revenue on commercial aircraft contracts is recognized at the point in time when an aircraft is completed and accepted
by the customer. Revenue on certain military derivative aircraft contracts is recognized over the contract term (over
time) as costs are incurred.
BDS engages in the research, development, production and modification of the following products and related services:
manned and unmanned military aircraft and weapons systems, surveillance and engagement, strategic defense and
intelligence systems, satellite systems and space exploration. BDS revenue is generally recognized over the contract
term (over time) as costs are incurred.
BGS provides parts, maintenance, modifications, logistics support, training, data analytics and information-based
services to commercial and government customers worldwide. BGS segment revenue and costs include certain
services provided to other segments. Revenue on commercial spare parts contracts is recognized at the point in time
when a spare part is delivered to the customer. Revenue on other contracts is generally recognized over the contract
term (over time) as costs are incurred.
BCC facilitates, arranges, structures and provides selective financing solutions for our Boeing customers.
While our principal operations are in the United States, Canada and Australia, some key suppliers and subcontractors
are located in Europe and Japan. Revenues, including foreign military sales, are reported by customer location and
consist of the following:
Years ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016

Revenues from the U.S. government (including foreign military sales through the U.S. government), primarily recorded
at BDS and BGS, represented 31%, 31% and 30% of consolidated revenues for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
Approximately 4% of operating assets were located outside the United States as of December 31, 2018 and 2017.
The following tables present BCA, BDS and BGS revenues from contracts with customers disaggregated in a number
of ways, such as geographic location, contract type and the method of revenue recognition. We believe these best
depict how the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of our revenues and cash flows are affected by economic
factors.

Backlog
Our total backlog represents the estimated transaction prices on performance obligations to our customers for which
work remains to be performed. Backlog is converted into revenue in future periods as work is performed, primarily
based on the cost incurred or at delivery and acceptance of products, depending on the applicable accounting method.
Our backlog at December 31, 2018 was $490,481. We expect approximately 19% to be converted to revenue through
2019 and approximately 65% through 2022, with the remainder thereafter.

Unallocated Items, Eliminations and other
Unallocated items, eliminations and other include common internal services that support Boeing’s global business
operations, intercompany guarantees provided to BCC and eliminations of certain sales between segments. Such sales
include airplanes accounted for as operating leases and considered transferred to the BCC segment and airplanes
transferred to the BDS segment for further modification prior to delivery to the customer. The revenues and cost of
sales for these transfers are eliminated in the Unallocated items, eliminations and other caption. We generally allocate
costs to business segments based on the U.S. federal cost accounting standards. Components of Unallocated items,
eliminations and other are shown in the following table.

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Expense
Pension costs, comprising GAAP service and prior service costs, are allocated to BCA and the commercial operations
at BGS. Pension costs are allocated to BDS and BGS businesses supporting government customers using U.S.
Government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS), which employ different actuarial assumptions and accounting
conventions than GAAP. These costs are allocable to government contracts. Other postretirement benefit costs are
allocated to business segments based on CAS, which is generally based on benefits paid. FAS/CAS service cost
adjustment represents the difference between the FAS pension and postretirement service costs calculated under
GAAP and costs allocated to the business segments. Non-operating pension and postretirement expenses represent
the components of net periodic benefit costs other than service cost. These expenses are included in Other
income/(loss), net.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of The Boeing Company
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial position of The Boeing Company and
subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the related consolidated statements of operations,
comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018,
and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, and
the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018, in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria
established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 8, 2019, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting.
Change in Accounting Principle
As discussed in Notes 1 and 2 to the financial statements, in 2018 the Company changed its method of accounting for
revenue from contracts with customers.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the
PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities
laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material
misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to
those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of The Boeing Company
Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of The Boeing Company and subsidiaries (the “Company”)
as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company
maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based
on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018, of the
Company and our report dated February 8, 2019, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and
included an explanatory paragraph related to the Company’s change in method of accounting for revenue from
contracts with customers.
As described in Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, management excluded from its
assessment the internal control over financial reporting at KLX Inc., which was acquired on October 9, 2018 and whose
financial statements constitute approximately 4% of Total assets and less than 1% of each Total revenues and Earnings
from operations of the consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018.
Accordingly, our audit did not include the internal control over financial reporting at KLX Inc.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying
Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with
the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal
securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating
effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies
and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of

management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on
the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that
controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies
or procedures may deteriorate.

None.
Item 9A. Controls and Procedures
(a)Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.
Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have evaluated our disclosure controls and procedures as of
December 31, 2018 and have concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that
information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and
Exchange Commission’s rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure.
(b)Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as
such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f). Our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness
of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control – Integrated Framework
(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation
under the framework in Internal Control – Integrated Framework, our management concluded that our internal control
over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2018.
Our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018 did not
include an assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting of KLX Inc. (KLX), which was
acquired on October 9, 2018. The operating results of KLX are included in our consolidated financial statements from
the period subsequent to the acquisition date and represent approximately 4 percent of our Total assets as of
December 31, 2018 and less than 1 percent of each our Total revenues and Earnings from operations for the year then
ended. We will perform an assessment of the effectiveness of KLX’s internal control over financial reporting within one
year of the date of acquisition.
Our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an
independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included in Item 8 of this report and is
incorporated by reference herein.
(c)Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting.
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth quarter of 2018
that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.
