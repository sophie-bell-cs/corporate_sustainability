GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES
PART I
Item 1. Business
General Motors Company (sometimes referred to as we, our, us, ourselves, the Company, General Motors, or GM) was
incorporated as a Delaware corporation in 2009. We design, build and sell trucks, crossovers, cars and automobile parts worldwide.
Cruise is our global segment responsible for the development and commercialization of autonomous vehicle technology. We also
provide automotive financing services through General Motors Financial Company, Inc. (GM Financial). Except for per share
amounts or as otherwise specified, amounts presented within tables are stated in millions.
On July 31, 2017, we closed the sale of the Opel and Vauxhall businesses and certain other assets in Europe (the Opel/Vauxhall
Business) to Peugeot, S.A. (PSA Group). On October 31, 2017, we closed the sale of the European financing subsidiaries and
branches (the Fincos, and together with the Opel/Vauxhall Business, the European Business) to Banque PSA Finance S.A. and BNP
Paribas Personal Finance S.A. The European Business is presented as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial
statements for all periods presented. Unless otherwise indicated, information in this report relates to our continuing operations.
Automotive Our automotive operations meet the demands of our customers through our automotive segments: GM North America
(GMNA) and GM International (GMI). GMNA meets the demands of customers in North America with vehicles developed,
manufactured and/or marketed under the Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet and GMC brands. GMI primarily meets the demands of
customers outside North America with vehicles developed, manufactured and/or marketed under the Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet,
GMC and Holden brands. We also have equity ownership stakes in entities that meet the demands of customers in other countries,
primarily in China, with vehicles developed, manufactured and/or marketed under the Baojun, Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet and
Wuling brands.
In addition to the vehicles we sell through our dealer network to retail customers, we also sell vehicles directly or through our
dealer network to fleet customers, including daily rental car companies, commercial fleet customers, leasing companies and
governments. Our customers can obtain a wide range of aftersale vehicle services and products through our dealer network, such as
maintenance, light repairs, collision repairs, vehicle accessories and extended service warranties.
Refer to Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) and Note 24 to our
consolidated financial statements for financial information about our segments.
Competitive Position and Vehicle Sales The principal factors that determine consumer vehicle preferences in the markets in
which we operate include overall vehicle design, price, quality, available options, safety, reliability, fuel economy and functionality.
Market leadership in individual countries in which we compete varies widely.
We present both wholesale and total vehicle sales data to assist in the analysis of our revenue and our market share. Wholesale
vehicle sales data consists of sales to GM's dealers and distributors as well as sales to the U.S. Government and excludes vehicles
sold by our joint ventures. Wholesale vehicle sales data correlates to our revenue recognized from the sale of vehicles, which is the
largest component of Automotive net sales and revenue. In the year ended December 31, 2020, 30.5% of our wholesale vehicle
sales volume was generated outside the U.S. The following table summarizes wholesale vehicle sales by automotive segment
(vehicles in thousands):
Years Ended December 31,
2020 2019 2018
GMNA 2,707 80.3 % 3,214 76.4 % 3,555 75.5 %
GMI 663 19.7 % 995 23.6 % 1,152 24.5 %
Total 3,370 100.0 % 4,209 100.0 % 4,707 100.0 %
Total vehicle sales data represents: (1) retail sales (i.e., sales to consumers who purchase new vehicles from dealers or
distributors); (2) fleet sales, such as sales to large and small businesses, governments, and daily rental car companies; and (3)
vehicles used by dealers in their businesses, including courtesy transportation vehicles. Total vehicle sales data includes all sales by
joint ventures on a total vehicle basis, not based on our percentage ownership interest in the joint venture. Certain joint venture
agreements in China allow for the contractual right to report vehicle sales of non-GM trademarked vehicles by those joint ventures,
which are included in the total vehicle sales we report for China. While total vehicle sales data does not correlate

GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES
directly to the revenue we recognize during a particular period, we believe it is indicative of the underlying demand for our
vehicles. Total vehicle sales data represents management's good faith estimate based on sales reported by GM's dealers, distributors,
and joint ventures, commercially available data sources such as registration and insurance data, and internal estimates and forecasts
when other data is not available.
The following table summarizes industry and GM total vehicle sales and our related competitive position by geographic region

GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES
As discussed above, total vehicle sales and market share data provided in the table above includes fleet vehicles. Certain fleet
transactions, particularly sales to daily rental car companies, are generally less profitable than retail sales to end customers. The
following table summarizes estimated fleet sales and those sales as a percentage of total vehicle sales (vehicles in thousands):
Years Ended December 31,
2020 2019 2018
GMNA 493 741 740 
GMI 351 498 478 
Total fleet sales 844 1,239 1,218 
Fleet sales as a percentage of total vehicle sales 12.4 % 16.1 % 14.5 %
Product Pricing Several methods are used to promote our products, including the use of dealer, retail and fleet incentives such as
customer rebates and finance rate support. The level of incentives is dependent upon the level of competition in the markets in
which we operate and the level of demand for our products.
Cyclical and Seasonal Nature of Business The market for vehicles is cyclical and depends in part on general economic
conditions, credit availability and consumer spending. Vehicle markets are also seasonal. Production varies from month to month.
Vehicle model changeovers occur throughout the year as a result of new market entries.
Relationship with Dealers We market vehicles and automotive parts worldwide primarily through a network of independent
authorized retail dealers. These outlets include distributors, dealers and authorized sales, service and parts outlets. The number of
authorized dealerships were 4,697 in GMNA and 7,661 in GMI at December 31, 2020.
We and our joint ventures enter into a contract with each authorized dealer agreeing to sell to the dealer one or more specified
product lines at wholesale prices and granting the dealer the right to sell those vehicles to retail customers from an approved
location. Our dealers often offer more than one GM brand at a single dealership in a number of our markets. Authorized dealers
offer parts, accessories, service and repairs for GM vehicles in the product lines that they sell using GM parts and accessories. Our
dealers are authorized to service GM vehicles under our limited warranty program, and those repairs are made only with GM parts.
Our dealers generally provide their customers with access to credit or lease financing, vehicle insurance and extended service
contracts provided by GM Financial and other financial institutions.
The quality of GM dealerships and our relationship with our dealers and distributors are critical to our success given that dealers
maintain the primary sales and service interface with the end consumer of our products. In addition to the terms of our contracts
with our dealers, we are regulated by various country and state franchise laws and regulations that may supersede those contractual
terms and impose specific regulatory requirements and standards for initiating dealer network changes, pursuing terminations for
cause and other contractual matters.
Research, Product and Business Development and Intellectual Property Costs for research, manufacturing engineering, product
engineering and design and development activities primarily relate to developing new products or services or improving existing
products or services, including activities related to vehicle and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions control, improved fuel economy,
electrification, autonomous vehicles, and the safety of drivers and passengers. Research and development expenses were $6.2
billion, $6.8 billion and $7.8 billion in the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.
Product Development The Product Development organization is responsible for designing and integrating vehicle and propulsion
components while aiming to maximize part sharing across multiple vehicle segments. Global teams in Design, Program
Management, Component & Subsystem Engineering, Product Integrity, Safety, Propulsion Systems and Purchasing & Supply
Chain collaborate to meet customer requirements and maximize global economies of scale.
Our global vehicle architecture development is headquartered at our Global Technical Center in Warren, Michigan. Cross-
segment part sharing is an essential enabler to optimize our current vehicle portfolio, as we expect that more than 75% of our global
sales volume will come from five vehicle architectures by mid-decade. We will continue to leverage our current architecture
portfolio to accommodate our customers around the world while achieving our financial goals.
Battery Electric Vehicles We have committed to an all-electric future and are investing in multiple technologies offering
increasing levels of vehicle electrification with a core focus on zero emission battery electric vehicles as part of our long-term
strategy to reduce petroleum consumption and GHG emissions. We currently offer the Chevrolet Bolt EV, which has an
3

GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-estimated range of 259 miles on a full charge with the 2020 model year. We have also
announced our all-new Ultium battery electric architecture capable of more than 400 miles of GM-estimated range on a full charge
that will launch on the upcoming GMC Hummer EV in 2021, followed by the Cadillac LYRIQ in 2022 and additional models by
2025. This new platform will be flexible, allowing quick response to customer preferences with a shorter design and development
lead time compared to our internal combustion engine vehicles. Ultium will be leveraged across multiple brands and vehicle sizes,
styles and drive configurations. Our new electric vehicle assembly facilities will include Detroit-Hamtramck Assembly, renamed
"Factory ZERO". In January 2020, we announced a $2.2 billion investment in our Factory ZERO assembly plant, which is being re-
tooled into a fully-dedicated electric vehicle facility to produce the GMC Hummer EV, Cruise Origin, a shared self-driving vehicle,
and other electric vehicles. In October 2020, we also announced a $2.0 billion investment in our Spring Hill Manufacturing facility
in Tennessee, where we will build the Cadillac LYRIQ. In addition, we have announced plans to mass-produce battery cells for
these and other future battery electric vehicles at Ultium Cells LLC (an equally owned joint venture with LG Chem, Ltd.) in
Lordstown, Ohio.
To support mass market adoption of electric vehicles, we are working to ensure that our customers will have access to
comprehensive charging solutions. For personal vehicles, this means strategically addressing charging needs at home, the
workplace and in public locations. For fleet vehicles, this means turnkey charging solutions and fleet and facility energy
management services. We have announced collaborative work with several charge network operators to filter real-time data on their
respective networks and charge station health into our Energy Assist feature within the myChevrolet app, currently available to
Chevrolet Bolt EV drivers.
In January 2021, we announced a new business, BrightDrop, which will offer an ecosystem of electric first-to-last mile products,
software and services designed to help delivery and logistics companies deliver goods more efficiently. In addition, we plan to
invest approximately CAD $1.0 billion to convert our CAMI manufacturing plant in Ingersoll, Ontario to produce the BrightDrop
EV600 electric cargo van.
Autonomous Technology    We expect autonomous technology to lead to a future of zero crashes, zero emissions and zero
congestion. We believe that building all-electric vehicles with autonomous capabilities integrated from the beginning, rather than
through retrofits, is the most efficient way to unlock the tremendous potential societal benefits of self-driving cars. In January 2020,
the Cruise Origin was unveiled by Cruise which is being co-developed by GM, Cruise and Honda Motor Company, Ltd. (Honda).
The Cruise Origin will be built on General Motors’ all-new modular architecture, powered by the Ultium battery system. In
October 2020, Cruise received a permit from the California Department of Motor Vehicles to remove back-up drivers from Cruise
AV test vehicles in San Francisco and subsequently began truly driverless testing. Also in October 2020, GM and Cruise announced
they will file an exemption petition with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) seeking regulatory
approval for the Origin’s deployment, and have withdrawn an earlier exemption petition that was limited to the Cruise AVs derived
from the Chevrolet Bolt platform. In January 2021, we announced that Microsoft Corporation (Microsoft) will join us and other
investors in a $2.2 billion investment in Cruise. Cruise may continue to opportunistically seek additional funding in this round in
2021. Given the potential of all-electric self-driving vehicles to help save lives, reshape our cities and reduce emissions, the goal of
Cruise is to deliver its self-driving services as soon as possible, with safety being the gating metric.
Alternative Fuel Vehicles We believe alternative fuels offer significant potential to reduce petroleum consumption and resulting
GHG emissions in the transportation sector. By leveraging experience and capability developed around these technologies in our
global operations, we continue to develop FlexFuel vehicles that can run on ethanol-gasoline blend fuels as well as technologies
that support compressed natural gas and liquefied petroleum gas. We offer several 2021 model year FlexFuel vehicles in the U.S.
and Canada to retail and fleet customers capable of operating on gasoline, E85 ethanol or any combination of the two. We also
support the development of biodiesel blend fuels, which are alternative diesel fuels produced from renewable sources.
Hydrogen Fuel Cell Technology Another part of our long-term strategy toward electrification and the reduction of petroleum
consumption and GHG emissions is our commitment to the development of our Hydrotec hydrogen fuel cell technology. We
believe hydrogen fuel cells will play an important role in many automotive applications, such as commercial vehicles, where
customers will derive additional benefits from the ability to refuel quickly, extended range, and suitability for heavier payloads and
central refueling of large fleets. GM is also evaluating promising fuel cell end-use applications for aerospace, stationary backup
power and mobile power. In addition, GM and Honda, through their long-term strategic alliance to collaborate in research and
advanced engineering efforts on fuel cell systems, are developing and commercializing fuel cell systems with production scheduled
for the early 2020s. In January 2021, we announced an agreement to supply our Hydrotec fuel cell power cubes to Navistar for use
in its production model fuel cell electric vehicle.

GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES
OnStar and Vehicle Connectivity We offer OnStar and connected services to more than 22 million connected vehicles globally
through subscription-based and complimentary services. We are among the leaders in the industry with significant global real-world
experience in delivering connected services and advanced safety features. OnStar provides safety and security services for retail
and fleet customers, including automatic crash response, emergency services, roadside assistance, crisis assist, stolen vehicle
assistance and turn-by-turn navigation. We also offer a variety of connected services, including mobile applications for owners to
remotely control certain vehicle features and electric vehicle owners to locate charging stations, on-demand vehicle diagnostics,
GM Smart Driver, GM Marketplace in-vehicle commerce, Amazon Alexa in-vehicle voice, connected navigation, SiriusXM with
360L and 4G LTE wireless connectivity. We also offer Super Cruise, the industry's first hands-free driver assistance feature for
enabled roads, which is powered by vehicle connectivity by means of a Super Cruise subscription. The Super Cruise plan enables
real-time GPS and mapping updates and connects the vehicle to an OnStar emergency advisor for situations in which a driver is
non-responsive to escalating alerts. Super Cruise will be expanded to be included on 22 models by 2023. Additionally, we have
announced plans to integrate Google's Voice Assistant, navigation and app ecosystem into GM infotainment systems beginning in
2021.
Intellectual Property We are constantly innovating and hold a significant number of patents, copyrights, trade secrets and other
intellectual property that protect those innovations in numerous countries. While no single piece of intellectual property is
individually material to our business as a whole, our intellectual property is important to our operations and continued
technological development. Additionally, we hold a number of trademarks and service marks that are very important to our identity
and recognition in the marketplace.
Raw Materials, Services and Supplies We purchase a wide variety of raw materials, parts, supplies, energy, freight,
transportation and other services from numerous suppliers to manufacture our products. The raw materials primarily include steel,
aluminum, resins, copper, lead and precious metals. We have not experienced any significant shortages of raw materials and
normally do not carry substantial inventories of these raw materials in excess of levels reasonably required to meet our production
requirements. Costs are expected to remain elevated due to the price of commodities and the continuing existence of tariffs. We
purchase systems, components and parts from suppliers. A global semiconductor supply shortage is having wide-ranging effects
across multiple industries, particularly the automotive industry. Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion of this risk.
In some instances, we purchase systems, components, parts and supplies from a single source and may be at an increased risk for
supply disruptions. The inability or unwillingness of these sources to provide us with parts and supplies could have a material
adverse effect on our production capacity. Combined purchases from our two largest suppliers were approximately 11% of our total
purchases in each of the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, and approximately 12% of our total purchases in the year ended
December 31, 2018. Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion of these risks.
Environmental and Regulatory Matters
Automotive Criteria Emissions Control Our products are subject to laws and regulations globally that require us to control
certain non-GHG automotive emissions, including vehicle and engine exhaust emission standards, vehicle evaporative emission
standards and onboard diagnostic (OBD) system requirements. Emission requirements have become more stringent as a result of
stricter standards and new diagnostic requirements that have come into force in many markets around the world, often with very
little harmonization. While we believe all of our products are designed and manufactured in material compliance with substantially
all vehicle emissions requirements, regulatory authorities may conduct ongoing evaluations of products from all manufacturers.
The U.S. federal government, through the EPA, imposes stringent exhaust and evaporative emission control requirements on
vehicles sold in the U.S. The California Air Resources Board (CARB) likewise imposes stringent exhaust and evaporative emission
standards. These emission control standards will likely increase the time and mileage periods over which manufacturers are
responsible for a vehicle's emission performance. The Clean Air Act permits states that have areas with air quality compliance
issues to adopt California emission standards in lieu of federal requirements. Fourteen states and the District of Columbia have
adopted California emission standards, and there is a possibility that additional U.S. jurisdictions could adopt California emission
requirements in the future.
The Canadian federal government's current vehicle pollutant emission requirements are generally aligned with U.S. federal
requirements.

Table of Contents
GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES
Each model year we must obtain certification that our vehicles and heavy-duty engines will meet emission requirements of the
EPA before we can sell vehicles in the U.S. and Canada, and of CARB before we can sell vehicles in California and other states that
have adopted the California emission requirements.
In 2019, certain areas within China began implementation of the China 6 emission standard (China 6) requirements. China 6
combines elements of both European Union (EU) and U.S. standards and increases the time and mileage periods over which
manufacturers are responsible for a vehicle's emission performance. Nationwide implementation of China 6a for new registrations
occurred in January 2021, and the more stringent China 6b is expected to be implemented in July 2023. For additional information,
refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors.
Brazil has approved a set of national emissions standards referred to as L7, to be implemented in 2022, and L8, to be
implemented from 2025 onward. L7 standards include exhaust tailpipe gases, durability for emissions, evaporative emissions and
noise limits, additional OBD requirements and a phase-in for onboard refueling vapor recovery systems. L8 standards include real
drive emission targets for real driving emissions and reduce corporate exhaust limits every two years until 2031. Some of the
requirements are aligned with those of the EPA.
As a result of the sale of the Opel/Vauxhall Business, GM’s vehicle presence in Europe is smaller, but GM may still be affected
by actions taken by regulators related both to Opel/Vauxhall vehicles sold before the sale of the Opel/Vauxhall Business as well as
to other vehicles GM continues to sell in Europe. In the EU, increased scrutiny of compliance with emissions standards may result
in changes to these standards, including implementation of real driving emissions tests, as well as stricter interpretations or
redefinition of these standards and more rigorous enforcement. For example, our former German subsidiary has participated in
continuing discussions with German and European authorities concerning emissions control systems. For additional information,

Automotive Fuel Economy and Greenhouse Gas Emissions In the U.S., NHTSA promulgates and enforces Corporate Average
Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards for three separate fleets: domestically produced cars, imported cars and light-duty trucks.
Manufacturers are subject to substantial civil penalties if they fail to meet the applicable CAFE standard in any model year, after
considering all available credits for the preceding five model years, expected credits for the three succeeding model years and
credits obtained from other manufacturers. In addition to federal CAFE standards, the EPA promulgates and enforces GHG
emission standards, which are effectively fuel economy standards because the majority of vehicle GHG emissions are carbon
dioxide emissions that are emitted in direct proportion to the amount of fuel consumed by a vehicle. In March 2020, the EPA and
NHTSA issued a rule setting fuel economy and GHG emissions standards for the light-duty vehicles through the 2026 model year,
which is currently being challenged through litigation. On January 25, 2021, President Biden issued Executive Order 13990,
directing the EPA and NHTSA to, by July 2021, consider publishing a proposed rule suspending, revising, or rescinding those
standards, and has also permitted the Department of Justice to seek to stay or dispose of litigation challenging those standards. The
EPA and NHTSA also regulate the fuel efficiency and GHG emissions of medium- and heavy-duty vehicles, imposing more
stringent standards over time.
In addition, CARB has asserted the right to promulgate and enforce its own state GHG standards for motor vehicles, and other
states have asserted the right to adopt CARB's standards. CARB regulations previously stated that compliance with the EPA light-
duty program is deemed compliance with CARB standards. However, on December 12, 2018, CARB amended this regulation to
state that, in the event the EPA were to alter federal GHG stringency, which it now has, compliance with the EPA's GHG emissions
standards will no longer be deemed compliance with CARB's separate requirements. In September 2019, NHTSA and the EPA
issued a rule asserting that California is preempted from regulating GHG emissions, which is currently being challenged through
litigation. As a result, depending on the outcome of the federal CAFE and GHG rulemakings and related litigation and the finality
of CARB's regulatory amendment, in the future GM might be required to meet California GHG standards that are different than the
EPA standards.
CARB has also imposed the requirement that increasing percentages of Zero Emission Vehicles (ZEVs) must be sold in
California. The Clean Air Act permits states to adopt California emission standards, and 11 have adopted the ZEV requirements. In
September 2019, the EPA revoked the waiver it had granted to California that permitted its ZEV program, and NHTSA also
asserted preemption of California's ZEV program. Both the EPA and NHTSA's actions are currently being challenged through
litigation. Depending on the outcome of that litigation, there is a possibility that additional U.S. jurisdictions could adopt California
ZEV requirements in the future.
On January 25, 2021, President Biden issued Executive Order 13990, directing EPA and NHTSA to, by April 2021, consider
publishing a proposed rule suspending, revising, or rescinding EPA and NHTSA's September 2019 actions, and has also permitted
the Department of Justice to stay or dispose of litigation related to preemption of state GHG and ZEV standards. On

February 1, 2021, the Department of Justice filed a motion seeking to hold these preemption cases in abeyance pending
implementation of Executive Order 13990.
In Canada, light- and heavy-duty GHG regulations are currently patterned after the EPA GHG emissions standards. However, the
Canadian government is conducting a mid-term review of its 2022 to 2025 model year light-duty GHG standards and there is an
increased risk that future Canadian light-duty GHG regulations may not be aligned with the revised EPA regulations. In addition,
the Canadian province of Quebec has ZEV requirements regulating the 2018 to 2025 model years largely based on California
program requirements. The province of British Columbia also finalized similar ZEV regulations in July 2020 that cover the 2020 to
2039 model years. There is also the risk that the federal government or other provinces in Canada may pursue the implementation
of additional ZEV requirements in the future.
China has two fuel economy requirements for passenger vehicles: an individual vehicle pass-fail type approval requirement and a
fleet average fuel consumption requirement. With a focus on the fleet average program, the current China Phase 4 fleet average fuel
consumption requirement, which went into effect in 2016, is based on curb weight with full compliance required by 2020. China
Phase 4 has continued subsidies for plug-in hybrid, battery electric and fuel cell vehicles, which are referred to as New Energy
Vehicles (NEVs). Subsidies for NEV have been extended to the end of 2022. China Phase 5 has been developed with a planned
start in 2021 and full compliance is required by 2025. In addition, China has established an NEV Mandate that will require
passenger car manufacturers to produce a certain volume of NEVs to generate credits in 2019 and beyond to offset internal
combustion engine vehicle production volume. The number of credits per car is based on the level of electric range and energy
efficiency, with the goal of increasing NEV volume penetrations. Uncommitted NEV credits may be used to assist compliance with
the fleet average fuel consumption requirement. China has issued NEV credit targets between 2019 and 2023 and is setting new
NEV credit targets aiming at further increasing volumes of NEVs in 2024 and 2025.
In Brazil, the Secretary of Industry and Development promulgates and enforces CAFE standards and has enforced a new CAFE
program for the period October 2020 to September 2026 and October 2026 to September 2032 for light-duty and mid-size trucks
and sport utility vehicles (SUVs), including diesel vehicles, imposing more stringent standards for each period.
Regulators in other jurisdictions have already adopted or are developing fuel economy or carbon dioxide regulations. If
regulators in these jurisdictions seek to impose and enforce standards that are misaligned with market conditions, we may be forced
to take various actions to increase market support programs for certain vehicles and curtail production of others in order to achieve
compliance. We regularly evaluate our current and future product plans and strategies for compliance with fuel economy and GHG
regulations.
Industrial Environmental Control Our operations are subject to a wide range of environmental protection laws including those
regulating air emissions, water discharge, waste management and environmental cleanup. Certain environmental statutes require
that responsible parties fund remediation actions regardless of fault, legality of original disposal or ownership of a disposal site.
Under certain circumstances these laws impose joint and several liability as well as liability for related damages to natural
resources.
To mitigate the effects of our worldwide operations on the environment, we are embracing sustainability programs focused on
reducing GHG emissions, water consumption and discharge and waste disposal. At December 31, 2020, 81% of waste materials
generated in our manufacturing facilities across the globe are composted, reused or recycled. We estimate that our waste reduction
program diverted 1.0 million metric tons of waste from landfills in 2020, and resulted in 4.6 million metric tons of GHG emissions
avoided in global manufacturing operations.
In addition to reducing our impact on the environment, our waste reduction commitments generate income from the sale of
production by-products, reduce our use of raw materials and help to reduce the risks and financial liabilities associated with waste
disposal.
We continue our efforts to increase our use of renewable energy, improve our energy efficiency and work to drive growth and
scale of renewables. We are committed to meeting the electricity needs of our operations worldwide with renewable energy by
2035, pulling forward our previous commitment by five years, and plan to be carbon neutral by 2040 in our global products and
operations, supported by a commitment to science-based targets. In addition to our carbon goals, the company worked with the
Environmental Defense Fund to develop a shared vision of an all-electric future and an aspiration to eliminate tailpipe emissions
from new light-duty vehicles by 2035. Through December 31, 2020, we implemented projects and signed renewable energy
contracts globally that brought our total renewable energy capacity to over one gigawatt by 2023, which represents approximately
60% of our U.S. electricity use and over 40% of our global electricity use. In 2019, we executed our largest

green tariff to date with DTE Energy Company, sourcing 300,000 megawatt hours of renewable energy that will begin supplying us
in early 2021. Additionally, in 2020 we executed our largest power purchase agreement to date, with 180 megawatts of solar
electricity supplying our U.S. operations starting in 2023. We continue to seek opportunities for a diversified renewable energy
portfolio including wind, solar, and landfill gas. In 2020, Energy Star certified two assembly plants, one in Canada through Natural
Resources Canada and one in the U.S. as well as five buildings in the U.S. for superior energy management. We also met the EPA
Energy Star Challenge for Industry (EPA Challenge) at six additional sites by reducing energy intensity an average of 14% at these
sites within three years. To meet the EPA Challenge, industrial sites must reduce energy intensity by 10% within a five year period.
In total, 69 GM-owned manufacturing sites have met the EPA Challenge, with many sites achieving the goal multiple times for a
total of 129 recognitions. Additionally, we received recognition from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) of 50001 Ready status
for 25 facilities. The U.S. DOE 50001 Ready program is a self-guided approach for facilities to establish an energy management
system and self-attest to the structure of ISO 50001, a voluntary global standard for energy management systems in industrial,
commercial and institutional facilities. These sustainability efforts reduce our operational expenses and are part of our approach to
improve the sustainability of our operations by aligning our business strategy with aggressive environmental goals and reduction
targets, collecting accurate data, and publicly reporting progress against our targets.
Chemical Regulations We continually monitor the implementation of chemical regulations to maintain compliance and evaluate
their effect on our business, suppliers and the automotive industry.
Globally, governmental agencies continue to introduce new legislation and regulations related to the selection and use of
chemicals by mandating broad prohibitions or restrictions and implementing green chemistry, life cycle analysis and product
stewardship initiatives. These initiatives give broad regulatory authority to ban or restrict the use of certain chemical substances and
potentially affect automobile manufacturers' responsibilities for vehicle components at the end of a vehicle's life, as well as
chemical selection for product development and manufacturing. Global treaties and initiatives such as the Stockholm, Basel and
Rotterdam Conventions on Chemicals and Waste and the Minamata Convention on Mercury, are driving chemical regulations
across signatory countries. In addition, more global jurisdictions are establishing substance standards with regard to Vehicle Interior
Air Quality.
Chemical regulations are increasing in North America. In the U.S. the EPA is moving forward with risk analysis and management
of high priority chemicals under the authority of the 2016 Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act, and several U.S.
states have chemical management regulations that can affect vehicle design such as the California and Washington laws banning the
use of copper in brake friction material. Chemical restrictions in Canada continue to steadily progress as a result of Environment
and Climate Change Canada's Chemical Management Plan to assess existing substances and implement risk management controls
on any chemical deemed toxic.
China prohibits the use of several chemical substances in vehicles. There are also various regulations in China stipulating the
requirements for chemical management. Among other things, these regulations restrict the use, import and export of various
chemical substances. The failure of our joint venture partners or our suppliers to comply with these regulations could disrupt
production in China or prevent our joint venture partners from selling the affected products in the China market.
These emerging laws and regulations will potentially lead to increases in costs and supply chain complexity. We believe that we
are materially in compliance with substantially all of these requirements or expect to be materially in compliance by the required
dates.
Vehicle Safety
U.S. Requirements The National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966 (the Safety Act) regulates the vehicles and items
of motor vehicle equipment that we manufacture and sell. The Safety Act prohibits the sale in the United States of any new vehicle
or equipment that does not conform to applicable federal motor vehicle safety standards established by NHTSA. Meeting or
exceeding the many safety standards is costly as global compliance and non-governmental assessment requirements continue to
evolve and grow more complex, and lack harmonization globally. The Safety Act further requires that if we or NHTSA determine a
vehicle or an item of vehicle equipment does not comply with a safety standard, or that vehicle or equipment contains a defect that
poses an unreasonable safety risk, we must conduct a safety recall to remedy that condition in the affected vehicles. Should we or
NHTSA determine a safety defect or noncompliance issue exists with respect to any of our vehicles, the cost of such recall
campaigns could be substantial.

GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES
Other National Requirements Outside of the U.S., many countries have established vehicle safety standards and regulations and
are likely to adopt additional, more stringent requirements in the future. The European General Safety Regulation has introduced
UN-ECE regulations, which are required for the European Type Approval process. Globally, governments generally have been
adopting UN-ECE based regulations with some variations to address local concerns. Any difference between North American and
UN-ECE based regulations can add complexity and costs to vehicle development, and we continue to support efforts to harmonize
regulations to reduce complexity. New safety and recall requirements in various countries around the world, including in China,
Brazil, and Gulf Cooperation Council countries, also may add substantial costs and complexity to our safety and field action
activities globally. In Canada, vehicle regulatory requirements are currently aligned with U.S. regulations; however, under the
Canadian Motor Vehicle Safety Act, recall thresholds are different and the Minister of Transport has broad powers to order
manufacturers to submit a notice of defect or non-compliance when the Minister considers it to be in the interest of safety. Further,
various governments are beginning to mandate e-Call and other features that can be market-specific and add complexity and
increase our cost of compliance globally.
Crash Test Ratings and New Car Assessment Programs Organizations in various regions around the world, including in the U.S.,
rate and compare motor vehicles through various New Car Assessment Programs (NCAPs) to provide consumers and businesses
with additional information about the safety of new vehicles. NCAPs use crash tests and other evaluations that are different than
what is required by applicable regulations, and use stars to rate vehicle safety, with five stars awarded for the highest rating and one
for the lowest. Achieving high NCAP ratings, which can vary by country and region, can add complexity and cost to vehicles.
Automotive Financing - GM Financial GM Financial is our global captive automotive finance company and our global provider
of automobile finance solutions. GM Financial conducts its business in North America, South America and through joint ventures
in China.
GM Financial provides retail loan and lease lending across the credit spectrum. Additionally, GM Financial offers commercial
lending products to dealers including floorplan financing, which is lending to finance new and used vehicle inventory; and dealer
loans, which are loans to finance improvements to dealership facilities, to provide working capital, and to purchase and/or finance
dealership real estate. Other commercial lending products include financing for parts and accessories, dealer fleets and storage
centers.
In North America, GM Financial offers a sub-prime lending program. The program is primarily offered to consumers with a
FICO score or its equivalent of less than 620 who have limited access to automobile financing through banks and credit unions and
is expected to sustain a higher level of credit losses than prime lending.
GM Financial generally seeks to fund its operations in each country through local sources to minimize currency and country risk.
GM Financial primarily finances its loan, lease and commercial origination volume through the use of secured and unsecured credit
facilities, through securitization transactions and through the issuance of unsecured debt in the capital markets.

Human Capital The foundation of GM’s business is our vision – a world with zero crashes, zero emissions and zero congestion.
Our people are our most valuable asset, and we must continue to attract and retain the best talent in the world in order to achieve
this vision. As a result, we strive to create a Workplace of Choice to attract, retain and develop top talent by adhering to a
responsible employer philosophy, which includes, among other things, commitments to create job opportunities, pay workers fairly,
ensure safety and well-being, and promote diversity, equity and inclusion. Fundamental to these commitments are our company
values.
Our eight GM behaviors are the foundation of our culture; and how we behave encompasses key measures of our performance,
including the visible ways we conduct ourselves as we work with one another.
Diversity, equity and inclusion At GM, we are committed to fostering a culture of diversity, equity and inclusion. In every
moment, we must decide what we can do – individually and collectively – to drive meaningful deliberate change. GM’s
unwavering position includes a commitment to inclusion, an unequivocal condemnation of intolerance, and a commitment to stand
up against injustice. Our ability to meet the needs of a diverse and global customer base is tied closely to the behaviors of the
people within our company, which is why we are committed to fostering a culture that celebrates our differences.

GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES
Based on these longstanding values, our Chairman and CEO, Mary Barra, chairs an Inclusion Advisory Board (IAB) of 11
internal and external leaders who guide our work to improve diversity and inclusion in our company. The purpose of the IAB is to
consult with GM’s Senior Leadership Team with the long-term goal of inspiring the company to be inclusive through our words,
deeds and culture.
We also have a number of programs and partnerships aimed at enhancing our culture of inclusion throughout the company. For
example, we have 11 voluntary, employee-led resource groups that provide a forum for diverse employees and allies from a variety
of different backgrounds to share experiences and express concerns. Each group also works to attract new talent to our company
and offers employees opportunities to support our company’s diversity initiatives within the community.
In addition, we are expanding our partnerships with organizations aimed at supporting our ongoing efforts to increase the
representation of women and minorities in our workplace. Through our participation in the OneTen organization and Business
Roundtable Multiple Pathways initiative, for example, we are specifically aiming to build more robust pipelines for skills-based
hiring into our company. Working in concert with local organizations, such efforts are intended to create new pathways to
employment for individuals without four-year degrees, provide training opportunities for advancement, and create a more flexible
and inclusive talent pipeline.
Develop and Retain Talented People Today, we compete for talent against other automotive companies and, increasingly, against
businesses in other sectors, such as technology. To win and keep talent, we must provide a workplace culture that encourages
employee behaviors aligned with our values, fulfills their long-term individual aspirations and achieves full engagement. In
furtherance of this goal, we invest significant resources to retain and develop our talent. In addition to mentoring and networking
opportunities, we offer a vast array of career development resources to help develop, grow and enable employees to make the most
of their careers at GM. Such resources include, among other things, the Technical Education Program, which offers our employees
an opportunity to complete corporate strategically aligned degrees and certificate programs at leading universities, our Learning
Management System with access to ongoing learning resources to augment and enrich employees’ professional development and
Percipio Resources, which provides our employees with access to a full range of videos, books, and eBooks to develop and
enhance skills. Employees in some of our technical roles also have the opportunity to participate in the GM Technical Learning
University — a training and upskilling program designed to expand and update the technical prowess of our workforce.
Safety and well-being The safety and well-being of our employees is also a critical component of our ability to transform the
future of personal mobility. At GM, we pride ourselves on our commitment to live values that return people home safely – Every
Person, Every Site, Every Day. Our unwavering commitment to safety is manifested through empowering employees to “Speak Up
for Safety” through various means without fear of retaliation. The well-being of our employees is equally as important to entice and
stimulate creativity and innovation. In addition to traditional healthcare, paid time off, paid parental leave, wellness programs,
flextime scheduling and telecommuting arrangements and retirement benefits, including a 401(k) matching program, GM offers a
variety of benefits and resources to support employees physical and mental health, including on-site fitness facilities and a health
concerns hotline, which help us both attract talent and reap the benefits of a healthier workforce.

Item 1A. Risk Factors
We have listed below the most material risk factors applicable to us. These risk factors are not necessarily in the order of
importance or probability of occurrence:
Risks related to our competition and strategy
If we do not deliver new products, services and customer experiences in response to increased competition and changing
consumer preferences in the automotive industry, our business could suffer. We believe that the automotive industry will
continue to experience significant change in the coming years, particularly as traditional automotive original equipment
manufacturers (OEMs) shift resources to the development of electric vehicles. In addition to our traditional competitors, we must
also be responsive to the entrance of non-traditional participants in the automotive industry. Industry participants are disrupting the
historic business model of our industry through the introduction of new technologies, products, services, direct-to-consumer sales
channels, methods of transportation and vehicle ownership. It is a strategic imperative that we succeed in driving the technological
disruption occurring in our industry, including consumer adoption of electric vehicles and commercialization of autonomous
vehicles. To successfully execute our long-term strategy, we must continue to develop new products and services, including
products and services that are outside of our historically core business, such as autonomous and electric vehicles, digital services
and transportation as a service. The process of designing and developing new technology, products and services is complex, costly
and uncertain and requires extensive capital investment and the ability to retain and recruit the best talent. There can be no
assurance that advances in technology will occur in a timely or feasible way, that others will not acquire similar or superior
technologies sooner than we do, or that we will acquire technologies on an exclusive basis or at a significant price advantage. If we
do not adequately prepare for and respond to new kinds of technological innovations, market developments and changing customer
needs, our sales, profitability and long-term competitiveness may be harmed.
Our ability to maintain profitability is dependent upon our ability to timely fund and introduce new and improved vehicle
models, including electric vehicles, that are able to attract a sufficient number of consumers. We operate in a very competitive
industry with market participants routinely introducing new and improved vehicle models and features designed to meet rapidly
evolving consumer expectations. Producing new and improved vehicle models, including electric vehicles, that preserve our
reputation for designing, building and selling safe, high-quality cars and trucks is critical to our long-term profitability. Successful
launches of our new vehicles are critical to our short-term profitability. The new vehicle development process generally takes two
years or more, and a number of factors may lengthen that time period. Because of this product development cycle and the various
elements that may contribute to consumers’ acceptance of new vehicle designs, including competitors’ product introductions,
technological innovations, fuel prices, general economic conditions, infrastructure and changes in quality, safety, reliability and
styling demands and preferences, an initial product concept or design may not result in a vehicle that generates sales in sufficient
quantities and at high enough prices to be profitable. Our high proportion of fixed costs, both due to our significant investment in
property, plant and equipment as well as other requirements of our collective bargaining agreements, which limit our flexibility to
adjust personnel costs to changes in demands for our products, may further exacerbate the risks associated with incorrectly
assessing demand for our vehicles.
Our near-term profitability is dependent upon the success of our current line of full-size SUVs and pickup trucks. While we
offer a portfolio of cars, crossovers, SUVs and trucks, and we have announced significant plans to design, build and sell a broad
portfolio of electric vehicles, we currently recognize higher profit margins on our SUVs and trucks. Our near-term success is
dependent upon our ability to sell higher margin vehicles in sufficient volumes. Any near-term shift in consumer preferences
toward smaller, more fuel-efficient vehicles, whether as a result of increases in the price of oil or any sustained shortage of oil,
including as a result of global political instability, concerns about climate change or other reasons, could weaken the demand for
our higher margin vehicles. More stringent fuel economy regulations could also impact our ability to sell these vehicles.

GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES
We operate in a highly competitive industry that has excess manufacturing capacity, and attempts by our competitors to sell
more vehicles could have a significant negative effect on our vehicle pricing, market share and operating results. The global
automotive industry is highly competitive in terms of the quality, innovation, new technologies, pricing, fuel economy, reliability,
safety, customer service and financial services offered. Additionally, overall manufacturing capacity in the industry far exceeds
current demand. Many manufacturers, including GM, have relatively high fixed labor costs as well as limitations on their ability to
close facilities and reduce fixed costs. In light of such excess capacity and high fixed costs, many industry participants have
attempted to sell more vehicles by providing subsidized financing or leasing programs, offering marketing incentives or reducing
vehicle prices. As a result, we may be required to offer similar incentives that may result in vehicle prices that do not offset cost
increases or the impact of adverse currency fluctuations, which could affect our profitability. Our competitors may also seek to
benefit from economies of scale by consolidating or entering into other strategic agreements such as alliances or joint ventures
intended to enhance their competitiveness.
Manufacturers in countries that have lower production costs, such as China and India, have become competitors in key emerging
markets and have announced their intention to export their products to established markets as a low-cost alternative to established
entry-level automobiles. In addition, foreign governments may decide to implement tax and other policies that favor their domestic
manufacturers at the expense of international manufacturers, including GM and its joint venture partners. These actions have had,
and are expected to continue to have, a significant negative effect on our vehicle pricing, market share and operating results.
Our long-term strategy is dependent upon our ability to deliver a broad portfolio of electric vehicles that will drive consumer
adoption. The production and profitable sale of electric vehicles has become increasingly important to our long-term business as
we accelerate our transition to an all-electric future. In 2020, we announced the commitment of $27 billion in investments in
electric and autonomous vehicle technologies through 2025, with plans to launch 30 new electric vehicle models globally in that
timeframe. Our electric vehicle strategy is dependent on our ability to deliver a broad portfolio of electric vehicles; reduce the costs
associated with the manufacture of electric vehicles; increase vehicle range and the energy density of our batteries; license and
monetize our proprietary platforms; develop new software and services; and leverage our scale, manufacturing capabilities and
synergies with existing internal combustion engine vehicles. In addition, consumer adoption of electric vehicles will be critical to
the success of our strategy. Consumer adoption of electric vehicles could be impacted by numerous factors, including the breadth of
the portfolio of electric vehicles available; perceptions about electric vehicle features, quality, safety, performance and cost relative
to internal combustion engine vehicles; the range over which electric vehicles may be driven on a full battery charge; availability of
high fuel-economy internal combustion engine vehicles; volatility in the cost of fuel; government regulations and economic
incentives; and the proliferation of a robust, open-standard electric vehicle charging ecosystem. If we are unable to successfully
deliver on our electric vehicle strategy, it could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and
growth prospects.
Our autonomous vehicle strategy is dependent upon our ability to successfully mitigate unique technological, operational, and
regulatory risks. In recent years, we announced significant investments in autonomous vehicle technologies, including in GM
Cruise Holdings LLC (Cruise Holdings), our majority-owned subsidiary that is responsible for the development and
commercialization of autonomous vehicle technology. Our autonomous vehicle operations are capital intensive and subject to a
variety of risks inherent with the development of new technologies, including our ability to continue to develop self-driving
software and hardware, such as Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensors and other components; access to sufficient capital,
including with respect to additional Softbank funding; risks related to the manufacture of purpose-built autonomous vehicles; and
significant competition from both established automotive companies and technology companies, some of which may have more
resources and capital to devote to autonomous vehicle technologies than we do. In addition, we face risks related to the commercial
deployment of autonomous vehicles on our targeted timeline or at all, including consumer acceptance, achievement of adequate
safety and other performance standards and compliance with uncertain, evolving and potentially conflicting federal and state or
provincial regulations. To the extent accidents, cybersecurity breaches or other adverse events associated with our autonomous
driving systems occur, we could be subject to liability, government scrutiny and further regulation, and it could deter consumer
adoption of autonomous vehicle technology. Any of the foregoing could materially and adversely affect our results of operations,
financial condition and growth prospects.
Risks related to our operations
The COVID-19 pandemic may disrupt our business and operations, which could materially adversely impact our business,
financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. Pandemics, epidemics or disease outbreaks in the U.S. or globally may
disrupt our business, which could materially affect our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and future expectations.
The COVID-19 outbreak has caused significant disruption to the global economy, including the automotive industry, and has had a
material impact on our business as discussed in detail in Part II, Item 7. MD&A. However, the full extent to which the COVID-19
pandemic will impact our operations will depend on future developments, including the duration and severity of the outbreak, any
subsequent outbreaks and the timing and efficacy of any available vaccines. Future developments are highly uncertain and cannot
be predicted with confidence and may adversely impact our global supply chain and global manufacturing operations and cause us
to again suspend our operations in the U.S. and elsewhere. In particular, if

COVID-19 continues to spread or re-emerges, particularly in North America where our profits are most concentrated, resulting in a
prolonged period of travel, commercial, social and other similar restrictions, we could experience among other things: (1) global
supply disruptions; (2) labor disruptions; (3) an inability to manufacture; (4) an inability to sell to our customers; (5) a decline in
showroom traffic and customer demand during and following the pandemic; (6) customer defaults on automobile loans and leases;
(7) lower than expected pricing on vehicles sold at auction; and (8) an impaired ability to access credit and the capital markets. We
may also be subject to enhanced legal risks, including potential litigation related to the COVID-19 pandemic. We also have
substantial cash requirements going forward, including: (1) ongoing cash costs including payments associated with previously
announced vehicle recalls, the settlements of multi-district litigation and other recall-related contingencies, payments to service
debt and other long-term obligations, including mandatory contributions to our pension plans; and (2) capital expenditures and
payments for engineering and product development activities. Our ability to meet these cash requirements may be negatively
impacted by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Any resulting financial impact cannot be reasonably estimated at this time, but the
COVID-19 pandemic could have a material impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations going forward. For
a further discussion of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our liquidity, refer to the “Liquidity and Capital Resources”
section in Part II, Item 7. MD&A.
Our business is highly dependent upon global automobile market sales volume, which can be volatile. Because we have a high
proportion of relatively fixed structural costs, small changes in sales volume can have a disproportionately large effect on our
profitability. A number of economic and market conditions drive changes in new vehicle sales, including the availability and prices
of used vehicles, levels of unemployment, availability of affordable financing, fluctuations in the cost of fuel, consumer confidence,
real estate values, political unrest, the occurrence of a contagious disease or illness, including COVID-19 (see “The COVID-19
pandemic may disrupt our business and operations, which could materially adversely impact our business, financial condition,
liquidity and results of operations” in this Item 1A, Risk Factors), barriers to trade and other global economic conditions. For a
discussion of economic and market trends, see the "Overview" section in Part II, Item 7. MD&A.
Our significant business in China subjects us to unique operational, competitive and regulatory risks. Maintaining a strong
position in the Chinese market is a key component of our global growth strategy. Our business in China is subject to aggressive
competition from many of the largest global manufacturers and numerous domestic manufacturers as well as non-traditional market
participants, such as domestic technology companies. In addition, our success in China depends upon our ability to adequately
address unique market and consumer preferences driven by advancements related to electric vehicles, infotainment and other new
technologies. Our ability to fully deploy our technologies in China may be impacted by evolving laws and regulations in the U.S.
and China. Increased competition, increased U.S.-China trade restrictions and weakening economic conditions in China, among
other things, may result in price reductions, reduced sales, profitability and margins, and challenges to gain or hold market share. In
addition, Chinese regulators have implemented increasingly aggressive “green” policy initiatives requiring OEMs to reduce the
average emissions and average fuel consumption of their products and to achieve quotas for the sale of electric vehicles, which
have challenging lead times.
Certain risks and uncertainties of doing business in China are solely within the control of the Chinese government, and Chinese
law regulates the scope of our investments and business conducted within China. In order to maintain access to the Chinese market,
we may be required to comply with significant technical and other regulatory requirements that are unique to the Chinese market, at
times with challenging lead times to implement such requirements. These actions may increase the cost of doing business in China
and reduce our profitability.
A significant amount of our operations are conducted by joint ventures that we cannot operate solely for our benefit. Many of
our operations, primarily in China and Korea as well as our battery manufacturing operations with LG Chem, are carried out by
joint ventures. In joint ventures we share ownership and management of a company with one or more parties who may not have the
same goals, strategies, priorities or resources as we do and may compete with us outside the joint venture. Joint ventures are
intended to be operated for the equal benefit of all co-owners, rather than for our exclusive benefit. Operating a business as a joint
venture often requires additional organizational formalities as well as time-consuming procedures for sharing information and
making decisions that must further take into consideration our partners' interests. In joint ventures we are required to foster our
relationships with our co-owners as well as promote the overall success of the joint venture, and if a co-owner changes,
relationships deteriorate or strategic objectives diverge, our success in the joint venture may be materially adversely affected. The
benefits from a successful joint venture are shared among the co-owners, therefore we do not receive all the benefits from our
successful joint ventures.
In addition, because we share ownership and management with one or more parties, we may have limited control over the actions
of a joint venture, particularly when we own a minority interest. As a result, we may be unable to prevent violations of applicable
laws or other misconduct by a joint venture or the failure to satisfy contractual obligations by one or more parties. Moreover, a joint
venture may not follow the same requirements regarding compliance, internal controls and internal control over financial reporting
that we follow. To the extent another party makes decisions that negatively impact the joint venture or internal control issues arise
within the joint venture, we may have to take responsive actions, or we may be subject to penalties, fines or other punitive actions
for these activities.

The international scale and footprint of our operations expose us to additional risks. We manufacture, sell and service products
globally and rely upon an integrated global supply chain to deliver the raw materials, components, systems and parts that we need
to manufacture our products. Our global operations subject us to extensive domestic and foreign legal and regulatory requirements,
and a variety of other political, economic and regulatory risks including: (1) changes in government leadership; (2) changes in
labor, employment, tax, privacy, environmental and other laws, regulations or government policies impacting our overall business
model or practices or restricting our ability to manufacture, purchase or sell products consistent with market demand and our
business objectives; (3) political pressures to change any aspect of our business model or practices or that impair our ability to
source raw materials, services, components, systems and parts, or manufacture products on competitive terms in a manner
consistent with our business objectives; (4) political instability, civil unrest or government controls over certain sectors; (5) political
and economic tensions between governments and changes in international trade policies, including restrictions on the repatriation
of dividends or in the export of technology, especially between China and the U.S.; (6) more detailed inspections or new or higher
tariffs, for example, on products imported into or exported from the U.S., including under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act
of 1962, Section 301 of the U.S. Trade Act of 1974, or other trade measures; (7) new barriers to entry or domestic preference
procurement requirements, including changes to, withdrawals from or impediments to implementing free trade agreements (for
example, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement), or preferences of foreign nationals for domestically manufactured
products; (8) changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly in Brazil and Argentina, and interest rates; (9) economic
downturns or significant changes in conditions in the countries in which we operate; (10) differing local product preferences and
product requirements, including government certification requirements related to, among other things, fuel economy, vehicle
emissions and safety; (11) impact of changes to and compliance with U.S. and foreign countries’ export controls, economic
sanctions and other similar measures; (12) liabilities resulting from U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including, but not
limited to, those related to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and certain other anti-corruption laws; (13) differing labor regulations,
requirements and union relationships; (14) differing dealer and franchise regulations and relationships; (15) difficulties in obtaining
financing in foreign countries for local operations; and (16) natural disasters, public health crises, including the occurrence of a
contagious disease or illness, such as COVID-19 (see “The COVID-19 pandemic may disrupt our business and operations, which
could materially adversely impact our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations” in this Item 1A, Risk
Factors), and other catastrophic events.
Any significant disruption at one of our manufacturing facilities could disrupt our production schedule. We assemble vehicles
at various facilities around the world. Our facilities are typically designed to produce particular models for particular geographic
markets. No single facility is designed to manufacture our full range of vehicles. In some cases, certain facilities produce products,
systems, components and parts that disproportionately contribute a greater degree to our profitability than others and create
significant interdependencies among manufacturing facilities around the world. Should these or other facilities become unavailable
either temporarily or permanently for any number of reasons, including labor disruptions, the occurrence of a contagious disease or
illness, such as COVID-19 (see “The COVID-19 pandemic may disrupt our business and operations, which could materially
adversely impact our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations” in this Item 1A, Risk Factors), or
catastrophic weather events, the inability to manufacture at the affected facility may result in harm to our reputation, increased
costs, lower revenues and the loss of customers. In particular, substantially all of our hourly employees are represented by unions
and covered by collective bargaining agreements that must be negotiated from time-to-time, often at the local facility level, which
increases our risk of work stoppages. We may not be able to easily shift production to other facilities or to make up for lost
production. Any new facility needed to replace an inoperable manufacturing facility would need to comply with the necessary
regulatory requirements, need to satisfy our specialized manufacturing requirements and require specialized equipment.
Any disruption in our suppliers’ operations could disrupt our production schedule. Our automotive operations are dependent
upon the continued ability of our suppliers to deliver the systems, components, raw materials and parts that we need to manufacture
our products. Our use of “just-in-time” manufacturing processes allows us to maintain minimal inventory. As a result, our ability to
maintain production is dependent upon our suppliers delivering sufficient quantities of systems, components, raw materials and
parts on time to meet our production schedules. In some instances, we purchase systems, components, raw materials and parts that
are ultimately derived from a single source and may be at an increased risk for supply disruptions. Any number of factors, including
labor disruptions, catastrophic weather events, the occurrence of a contagious disease or illness, such as COVID-19 (see “The
COVID-19 pandemic may disrupt our business and operations, which could materially adversely impact our business, financial
condition, liquidity and results of operations” in this Item 1A, Risk Factors), contractual or other disputes, unfavorable economic or
industry conditions, delivery delays or other performance problems or financial difficulties or solvency problems, could disrupt our
suppliers’ operations and lead to uncertainty in our supply chain or cause supply disruptions for us, which could, in turn, disrupt our
operations, including the production of certain higher margin vehicles. If the COVID-19 pandemic continues to spread or re-
emerges and results in a prolonged period of travel, commercial, social and other similar restrictions, we could experience
continued and/or additional global supply disruptions. If we experience supply disruptions, we may not be able to develop alternate
sourcing quickly. Any disruption of our production schedule caused by an unexpected shortage of systems, components, raw
materials or parts even for a relatively short period of time could cause us to alter production schedules or suspend production
entirely, which could cause a loss of revenues, which would adversely affect our operations.

In particular, a global semiconductor supply shortage is having wide-ranging effects across multiple industries, particularly the
automotive industry, and it has impacted multiple suppliers that incorporate semiconductors into the parts they supply to us. As a
result, the semiconductor supply shortage has had, and will continue to have, an impact on our vehicle production, and we
anticipate it will have a material impact on our performance in 2021.
High prices of raw materials or other inputs used by us and our suppliers could negatively impact our profitability. Increases
in prices for raw materials or other inputs that we and our suppliers use in manufacturing products, systems, components and parts,
such as steel, precious metals, non-ferrous metals, critical minerals or other similar raw materials, may lead to higher production
costs for parts, components and vehicles. Changes in trade policies and tariffs, fluctuations in supply and demand and other
economic and political factors may continue to create pricing pressure for raw materials and other inputs. This could, in turn,
negatively impact our future profitability because we may not be able to pass all of those costs on to our customers or require our
suppliers to absorb such costs.
We may continue to restructure our operations in the U.S. and various other countries and initiate additional cost reduction
actions, but we may not succeed in doing so. Since 2017, we have undertaken restructuring actions to lower our operating costs in
response to difficult market and operating conditions in various parts of the world, including the U.S., Canada, Korea, Southeast
Asia, India, Australia and New Zealand and Europe. As we continue to assess our performance throughout our regions, we may
take additional restructuring actions to rationalize our operations, which may result in material asset write-downs or impairments
and reduce our profitability in the periods incurred. In addition, we are continuing to implement a number of operating
effectiveness initiatives to improve productivity and reduce costs. In addition, these restructuring actions subject us to increased
risks of labor unrest or strikes, supplier, dealer, or other third-party litigation, regulator claims or proceedings, negative publicity
and business disruption. Failure to realize anticipated savings or benefits from our restructuring and/or cost reduction actions could
have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity and cash flows.
Risks related to our intellectual property, cybersecurity, information technology and data management practices
Competitors may independently develop products and services similar to ours, and there are no guarantees that GM’s
intellectual property rights would prevent competitors from independently developing or selling those products and services.
There may be instances where, notwithstanding our intellectual property position, competitive products or services may impact the
value of our brands and other intangible assets, and our business may be adversely affected. Moreover, although GM takes
reasonable steps to maintain the confidentiality of GM proprietary information, there can be no assurance that such efforts will
completely deter or prevent misappropriation or improper use of our technology. We sometimes face attempts to gain unauthorized
access to our information technology networks and systems for the purpose of improperly acquiring our trade secrets or
confidential business information. The theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business
information as a result of such an incident could adversely affect our competitive position. In addition, we may be the target of
patent enforcement actions by third parties, including aggressive and opportunistic enforcement claims by non-practicing entities.
Regardless of the merit of such claims, responding to infringement claims can be expensive and time-consuming. Although we
have taken steps to mitigate such risks, if we are found to have infringed any third-party intellectual property rights, we could be
required to pay substantial damages, or we could be enjoined from offering some of our products and services.
Security breaches and other disruptions to information technology systems and networked products, including connected
vehicles, owned or maintained by us, GM Financial, or third-party vendors or suppliers on our behalf, could interfere with our
operations and could compromise the confidentiality of private customer data or our proprietary information. We rely upon
information technology systems and manufacture networked products, some of which are managed by third parties, to process,
transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of our business processes, activities and products.
Additionally, we and GM Financial collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property and proprietary business
information (including that of our dealers and suppliers), as well as personally identifiable information of our customers and
employees, in data centers and on information technology networks (including networks that may be controlled or maintained by
third parties). The secure operation of these systems and products, and the processing and maintenance of the information
processed by these systems and products, is critical to our business operations and strategy. Further, customers using our systems
rely on the security of our infrastructure, including hardware and other elements provided by third parties, to ensure the reliability
of our products and the protection of their data. Despite security measures and business continuity plans, these systems and
products may be vulnerable to damage, disruptions or shutdowns caused by attacks by hackers, computer viruses, malware
(including “ransomware”), phishing attacks or breaches due to errors or malfeasance by employees, contractors and others who
have access to these systems and products. The occurrence of any of these events could compromise the confidentiality, operational
integrity and accessibility of these systems and products and the data that resides within them. Similarly, such an occurrence could
result in the compromise or loss of the information processed by these systems and products. Such events could result in, among
other things, the loss of proprietary data, interruptions or delays in our business operations and damage to our reputation. In
addition, such events could increase the risk of claims alleging that we are non-
17

GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES
compliant with applicable laws or regulations, subjecting us to potential liability or regulatory penalties and related costs under
laws protecting the privacy of personal information; disrupt our operations; or reduce the competitive advantage we hope to derive
from our investment in advanced technologies. We have experienced such events in the past and, although past events were
immaterial, future events may occur and may be material.
Security breaches and other disruptions of our in-vehicle systems could impact the safety of our customers and reduce
confidence in GM and our products. Our vehicles contain complex information technology systems. These systems control
various vehicle functions including engine, transmission, safety, steering, navigation, acceleration, braking, window and door lock
functions. We have designed, implemented and tested security measures intended to prevent unauthorized access to these systems.
However, hackers have reportedly attempted, and may attempt in the future, to gain unauthorized access to modify, alter and use
such systems to gain control of, or to change, our vehicles’ functionality, user interface and performance characteristics, or to gain
access to data stored in or generated by the vehicle. Any unauthorized access to or control of our vehicles or their systems could
adversely impact the safety of our customers or result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or regulatory penalties. New laws,
such as the new data law in Massachusetts that would permit third-party access to vehicle data and related systems, could expose
our vehicles and vehicle systems to third-party access without appropriate security measures in place, leading to new safety and
security risks for our customers and reducing customer trust and confidence in our products. In addition, regardless of their
veracity, reports of unauthorized access to our vehicles or their systems could negatively affect our brand and harm our reputation,
which could impact our business and operating results.
Our enterprise data practices, including the collection, use, sharing, and security of the Personal Identifiable Information of
our customers, employees and suppliers, are subject to increasingly complex, restrictive and punitive regulations in all key
market regions. Under these regulations, the failure to maintain compliant data practices could result in consumer complaints and
regulatory inquiry, resulting in civil or criminal penalties, as well as brand impact or other harm to our business. In addition,
increased consumer sensitivity to real or perceived failures in maintaining acceptable data practices could damage our reputation
and deter current and potential users or customers from using our products and services. Because many of these laws are new, there
is little clarity as to their interpretation, as well as a lack of precedent for the scope of enforcement. The cost of compliance with
these laws and regulations will be high and is likely to increase in the future. For example, the California Consumer Protection Act
became effective in 2020, obligating companies to quickly respond to consumer requests to delete, disclose and stop selling
personal information of California residents, with significant fines for noncompliance. Other U.S. states are considering similar
laws, with some considering private rights of action for consumers that would allow consumers to bring claims directly against GM
for mishandling their data. In Europe in 2020, the Court of Justice for the EU invalidated mechanisms for transferring personal
information out of the EU, leading to a wave of potential new barriers for data sharing between the EU and, among other countries,
the U.S. In Canada, both the federal government and certain provinces have also proposed new legislation imposing significant and
unprecedented obligations, fines and liabilities regarding data handling. Overcoming these new barriers is likely to increase our
costs and drive new complexity in our operations.
Risks related to government regulations and litigation
Our operations and products are subject to extensive laws, regulations and policies, including those related to vehicle
emissions, fuel economy standards and greenhouse gas emissions, that can significantly increase our costs and affect how we do
business. We are significantly affected by governmental regulations on a global basis that can increase costs related to the
production of our vehicles and affect our product portfolio, particularly regulations relating to emissions, fuel economy standards
and greenhouse gas emissions. Meeting or exceeding many of these regulations is costly and often technologically challenging,
especially because the standards are not harmonized across jurisdictions. We anticipate that the number and extent of these and
other regulations, laws and policies, and the related costs and changes to our product portfolio, may increase significantly in the
future, primarily out of concern for the environment (including concerns about global climate change and its impact). These
government regulatory requirements, among others, could significantly affect our plans for global product development and, given
the uncertainty surrounding enforcement and regulatory definitions and interpretations, may result in substantial costs, including
civil or criminal penalties. In addition, an evolving but un-harmonized emissions and fuel economy regulatory framework may
limit or dictate the types of vehicles we sell and where we sell them, which can affect our revenues. Refer to the “Environmental
and Regulatory Matters” section of Item 1. Business for further information on regulatory and environmental requirements.
We expect that to comply with fuel economy and emission control requirements, we will be required to sell a significant volume
of electric vehicles, and potentially develop and implement new technologies for conventional internal combustion engines, all at
increased costs. There are limits on our ability to achieve fuel economy improvements over a given time frame, primarily relating
to the cost and effectiveness of available technologies, lack of sufficient consumer acceptance of new technologies and of changes
in vehicle mix, lack of willingness of consumers to absorb the additional costs of new technologies, the appropriateness (or lack
thereof) of certain technologies for use in particular vehicles, the widespread availability (or lack thereof) of supporting
infrastructure for new technologies and the human, engineering and financial resources necessary to deploy new technologies
across a wide range of products and powertrains in a short time. There is no
18
Table of Contents
GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES
assurance that we will be able to produce and sell vehicles that use such new technologies on a profitable basis or that our
customers will purchase such vehicles in the quantities necessary for us to comply with these regulatory programs.
In the current uncertain regulatory framework, environmental liabilities for which we may be responsible and that are not
reasonably estimable could be substantial. Alleged violations of safety, fuel economy or emissions standards could result in legal
proceedings, the recall of one or more of our products, negotiated remedial actions, fines, restricted product offerings or a
combination of any of those items. Any of these actions could have a material adverse effect on our operations, including facility
idling, reduced employment, increased costs and loss of revenue.
In addition, many of our advanced technologies, including autonomous vehicles, present novel issues with which domestic and
foreign regulators have only limited experience, and will be subject to evolving regulatory frameworks. Any current or future
regulations in these areas could impact whether and how these technologies are designed and integrated into our products, and may
ultimately subject us to increased costs and uncertainty.
We could be materially adversely affected by unusual or significant litigation, governmental investigations or other
proceedings. We are subject to legal proceedings involving various issues, including product liability lawsuits, class action
litigations alleging product defects, emissions litigation (both in the U.S. and elsewhere), stockholder litigation, labor and
employment litigation in various countries (including U.S., Canada, Korea and Brazil), claims and actions arising from
restructurings, divestitures of operations and assets and proceedings related to the Ignition Switch Recall. In addition, we are
subject to governmental proceedings and investigations. A negative outcome in one or more of these legal proceedings could result
in the imposition of damages, including punitive damages, substantial fines, significant reputational harm, civil lawsuits and
criminal penalties, interruptions of business, modification of business practices, equitable remedies and other sanctions against us
or our personnel as well as significant legal and other costs. For a further discussion of these matters refer to Note 16 to our
consolidated financial statements.
The costs and effect on our reputation of product safety recalls and alleged defects in products and services could materially
adversely affect our business. Government safety standards require manufacturers to remedy certain product safety defects through
recall campaigns and vehicle repurchases. Under these standards, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties or may incur
various costs, including significant costs for repairs made at no cost to the consumer. At present, the costs we incur in connection
with these recalls typically include the cost of the part being replaced and labor to remove and replace the defective part. The costs
to complete a recall could be exacerbated to the extent that such action relates to a global platform. Concerns about the safety of our
products, including advanced technologies like autonomous vehicles, whether raised internally or by regulators or consumer
advocates, and whether or not based on scientific evidence or supported by data, can result in product delays, recalls, lost sales,
governmental investigations, regulatory action, private claims, lawsuits and settlements and reputational damage. These
circumstances can also result in damage to brand image, brand equity and consumer trust in our products and ability to lead the
disruption occurring in the automotive industry.
We currently source a variety of systems, components, raw materials and parts from third parties. From time to time these items
may have performance or quality issues that could harm our reputation and cause us to incur significant costs, particularly if the
affected items relate to global platforms or involve defects that are identified years after production. Our ability to recover costs
associated with recalls or other campaigns caused by parts or components purchased from suppliers may be limited by the
suppliers’ financial condition or a number of other reasons or defenses.
We may incur additional tax expense or become subject to additional tax exposure.  We are subject to the tax laws and
regulations of the U.S. and numerous other jurisdictions in which we do business. Many judgments are required in determining our
worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities, and we are regularly under audit by the U.S. Internal Revenue
Service and other tax authorities, which may not agree with our tax positions. In addition, our tax liabilities are subject to other
significant risks and uncertainties, including those arising from potential changes in laws and regulations in the countries in which
we do business, the possibility of adverse determinations with respect to the application of existing laws, changes in our business or
structure and changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities. Any unfavorable resolution of these and other
uncertainties may have a significant adverse impact on our tax rate and results of operations. If our tax expense were to increase, or
if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our operating results,
cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.
Risks related to Automotive Financing - GM Financial
We rely on GM Financial to provide financial services to our customers and dealers globally. GM Financial faces a number of
business, economic and financial risks that could impair its access to capital and negatively affect its business and operations,
which in turn could impede its ability to provide leasing and financing to customers and commercial lending to our dealers. Any
reduction in GM Financial’s ability to provide such financial services would negatively affect our efforts to support additional sales
of our vehicles and expand our market penetration among customers and dealers.
19
Table of Contents
GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES
The primary factors that could adversely affect GM Financial’s business and operations and reduce its ability to provide
financing services at competitive rates include the sufficiency, availability and cost of sources of financing, including credit
facilities, securitization programs and secured and unsecured debt issuances; the performance of loans and leases in its portfolio,
which could be materially affected by charge-offs, delinquencies and prepayments; wholesale auction values of used vehicles;
vehicle return rates and the residual value performance on vehicles GM Financial leases to customers; fluctuations in interest rates
and currencies; competition for customers from commercial banks, credit unions and other financing and leasing companies; and
changes to regulation, supervision, enforcement and licensing across various jurisdictions.
In addition, a substantial portion of GM Financial’s indebtedness bears interest at variable interest rates, primarily based on USD-
LIBOR. The U.K. Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, has announced that it will no longer persuade or compel
banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. It is unknown whether any banks will continue to voluntarily submit
rates for the calculation of LIBOR, or whether LIBOR will continue to be published by its administrator based on these
submissions or on any other basis, after 2021. At this time, it is not possible to predict the effect that these developments or any
discontinuance, modification or other reforms may have on LIBOR, other benchmarks or floating–rate debt instruments, including
GM Financial’s floating–rate debt. Any such discontinuance, modification, alternative reference rates or other reforms may
materially adversely affect interest rates on GM Financial’s current or future indebtedness. There is a risk that the discontinuation
of LIBOR will impact GM Financial's ability to manage interest rate risk effectively without an adequate replacement.
Further, as an entity operating in the financial services sector, GM Financial is required to comply with a wide variety of laws
and regulations that may be costly to adhere to and may affect our consolidated operating results. Compliance with these laws and
regulations requires that GM Financial maintain forms, processes, procedures, controls and the infrastructure to support these
requirements, and these laws and regulations often create operational constraints both on GM Financial’s ability to implement
servicing procedures and on pricing. Laws in the financial services industry are designed primarily for the protection of consumers.
The failure to comply with these laws could result in significant statutory civil and criminal penalties, monetary damages,
attorneys’ fees and costs, possible revocation of licenses and damage to reputation, brand and valued customer relationships.
Risks related to defined benefit pension plans
Our defined benefit pension plans are currently underfunded and our pension funding requirements could increase
significantly due to a reduction in funded status as a result of a variety of factors, including weak performance of financial
markets, declining interest rates, changes in laws or regulations, or changes in assumptions or investments that do not achieve
adequate returns. Our employee benefit plans currently hold a significant amount of equity and fixed income securities. A detailed
description of the investment funds and strategies and our potential funding requirements are disclosed in Note 15 to our
consolidated financial statements, which also describes significant concentrations of risk to the plan investments.
Our future funding requirements for our defined benefit pension plans depend upon the future performance of assets placed in
trusts for these plans, the level of interest rates used to determine funding levels, the level of benefits provided for by the plans and
any changes in laws and regulations. Future funding requirements generally increase if the discount rate decreases or if actual asset
returns are lower than expected asset returns, assuming other factors are held constant. We estimate future contributions to these
plans using assumptions with respect to these and other items. Changes to those assumptions could have a significant effect on
future contributions.
There are additional risks due to the complexity and magnitude of our investments. Examples include implementation of
significant changes in investment policy, insufficient market liquidity in particular asset classes and the inability to quickly
rebalance illiquid and long-term investments.
Factors that affect future funding requirements for our U.S. defined benefit plans generally affect the required funding for non-
U.S. plans. Certain plans outside the U.S. do not have assets and therefore the obligation is funded as benefits are paid. If local
legal authorities increase the minimum funding requirements for our non-U.S. plans, we could be required to contribute more
funds, which could negatively affect our liquidity and financial condition.

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
This MD&A should be read in conjunction with the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements and notes. Forward-
looking statements in this MD&A are not guarantees of future performance and may involve risks and uncertainties that could
cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. Refer to the "Forward-Looking Statements" section of this MD&A
and Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors for a discussion of these risks and uncertainties. The discussion of our financial condition and
results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 included in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 is incorporated by
reference into this MD&A.
Non-GAAP Measures Unless otherwise indicated, our non-GAAP measures discussed in this MD&A are related to our continuing
operations and not our discontinued operations. Our non-GAAP measures include: earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT)-
adjusted, presented net of noncontrolling interests; earnings before income taxes (EBT)-adjusted for our GM Financial segment;
earnings per share (EPS)-diluted-adjusted; effective tax rate-adjusted (ETR-adjusted); return on invested capital-adjusted (ROIC-
adjusted) and adjusted automotive free cash flow. Our calculation of these non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly
titled measures of other companies due to potential differences between companies in the method of calculation. As a result, the use
of these non-GAAP measures has limitations and should not be considered superior to, in isolation from, or as a substitute for,
related U.S. GAAP measures.
These non-GAAP measures allow management and investors to view operating trends, perform analytical comparisons and
benchmark performance between periods and among geographic regions to understand operating performance without regard to
items we do not consider a component of our core operating performance. Furthermore, these non-GAAP measures allow investors
the opportunity to measure and monitor our performance against our externally communicated targets and evaluate the investment
decisions being made by management to improve ROIC-adjusted. Management uses these measures in its financial, investment and
operational decision-making processes, for internal reporting and as part of its forecasting and budgeting processes. Further, our
Board of Directors uses certain of these and other measures as key metrics to determine management performance under our
performance-based compensation plans. For these reasons we believe these non-GAAP measures are useful for our investors.

EBIT-adjusted EBIT-adjusted is presented net of noncontrolling interests and is used by management and can be used by
investors to review our consolidated operating results because it excludes automotive interest income, automotive interest expense
and income taxes as well as certain additional adjustments that are not considered part of our core operations. Examples of
adjustments to EBIT include but are not limited to impairment charges on long-lived assets and other exit costs resulting from
strategic shifts in our operations or discrete market and business conditions; costs arising from the ignition switch recall and related
legal matters; and certain currency devaluations associated with hyperinflationary economies. For EBIT-adjusted and our other
non-GAAP measures, once we have made an adjustment in the current period for an item, we will also adjust the related non-
GAAP measure in any future periods in which there is an impact from the item. Our corresponding measure for our GM Financial
segment is EBT-adjusted because interest income and interest expense are part of operating results when assessing and measuring
the operational and financial performance of the segment.
EPS-diluted-adjusted EPS-diluted-adjusted is used by management and can be used by investors to review our consolidated
diluted EPS results on a consistent basis. EPS-diluted-adjusted is calculated as net income attributable to common stockholders-
diluted less income (loss) from discontinued operations on an after-tax basis, adjustments noted above for EBIT-adjusted and
certain income tax adjustments divided by weighted-average common shares outstanding-diluted. Examples of income tax
adjustments include the establishment or reversal of significant deferred tax asset valuation allowances.
ETR-adjusted ETR-adjusted is used by management and can be used by investors to review the consolidated effective tax rate
for our core operations on a consistent basis. ETR-adjusted is calculated as Income tax expense less the income tax related to the
adjustments noted above for EBIT-adjusted and the income tax adjustments noted above for EPS-diluted-adjusted divided by
Income before income taxes less adjustments. When we provide an expected adjusted effective tax rate, we do not provide an
expected effective tax rate because the U.S. GAAP measure may include significant adjustments that are difficult to predict.
ROIC-adjusted ROIC-adjusted is used by management and can be used by investors to review our investment and capital
allocation decisions. We define ROIC-adjusted as EBIT-adjusted for the trailing four quarters divided by ROIC-adjusted average
net assets, which is considered to be the average equity balances adjusted for average automotive debt and interest liabilities,
exclusive of finance leases; average automotive net pension and other postretirement benefits (OPEB) liabilities; and average
automotive net income tax assets during the same period.
Adjusted automotive free cash flow Adjusted automotive free cash flow is used by management and can be used by investors to
review the liquidity of our automotive operations and to measure and monitor our performance against our capital allocation
program and evaluate our automotive liquidity against the substantial cash requirements of our automotive operations. We measure
adjusted automotive free cash flow as automotive operating cash flow from continuing operations less capital expenditures adjusted
for management actions. Management actions can include voluntary events such as discretionary contributions to employee benefit
plans or nonrecurring specific events such as a closure of a facility that are considered special for EBIT-adjusted purposes. Refer to
the “Liquidity and Capital Resources” section of this MD&A for additional information.

Overview Our vision for the future is a world with zero crashes, zero emissions and zero congestion, which guides our growth-
focused investment in electrification, self-driving vehicles and new products and services. The all-electric future we are building
integrates our technology, scale and manufacturing expertise to drive growth, profitability and deliver world-class customer
interactions. Our strategy includes product leadership in electric vehicles and autonomous vehicles, continued leadership in trucks
and SUVs, and developing and monetizing new software and services. We will execute our strategy with a diverse team and a
steadfast commitment to good citizenship through sustainable operations and a leading health and safety culture.
The COVID-19 pandemic and government actions and measures taken to prevent its spread continue to affect our operations. In
response to COVID-19, we previously suspended the majority of our global manufacturing operations and our Automotive China
JVs’ manufacturing operations. By May 2020, we had resumed our global manufacturing operations. Government-imposed
restrictions on businesses, operations and travel and the related economic uncertainty have impacted demand for our vehicles in
most of our global markets. During the first half of 2020, we executed a number of austerity measures, including aggressive actions
to reduce costs and preserve liquidity, such as limiting advertising and other third-party spending, suspending our dividend on
common shares, deferring salaried employee compensation and delaying non-critical projects, including certain future product
programs. As production has returned to normal levels, the majority of the austerity measures we put into place have normalized.
The extent of COVID-19’s impact on our future operations, liquidity and the demand for our products will depend upon, among
other things, the duration and severity of the outbreak or subsequent outbreaks, related government responses, such as required
physical distancing or restrictions on business operations and travel, the pace of recovery of economic activity and the impact to
consumers, the effectiveness of available vaccines and any potential supply disruptions, all of which are uncertain and difficult to
predict in light of the rapidly evolving landscape. Refer to Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors for a full discussion of the risks associated
with the COVID-19 pandemic.
The automotive industry and GM are currently experiencing a global semiconductor supply shortage. The supply shortage has
impacted multiple suppliers that incorporate semiconductors into the parts they supply to us. We expect the semiconductor supply
shortage will have a short-term impact on our business. We do not expect this shortage to impact our growth and electric vehicle
initiatives, we will continue prioritizing full-size trucks, SUVs and electric vehicles. Refer to Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors for
further discussion of these risks.
For the year ending December 31, 2021, we expect EPS-diluted and EPS-diluted-adjusted of between $4.50 and $5.25, Net
income attributable to stockholders of between $6.8 billion and $7.6 billion and EBIT-adjusted of between $10.0 billion and $11.0
billion, inclusive of the impact of the semiconductor supply shortage. We do not consider the potential future impact of adjustments
on our expected financial results. We estimate the short-term semiconductor supply shortage to have a net EBIT-adjusted impact of
approximately $1.5 billion to $2.0 billion in the year ending December 31, 2021.

________
(a) We do not consider the potential future impact of adjustments on our expected financial results.
We also face continuing market, operating and regulatory challenges in several countries across the globe due to, among other
factors, weak economic conditions, competitive pressures, our product portfolio offerings, heightened emissions standards, labor
disruptions, foreign exchange volatility, rising material prices, evolving trade policy and political uncertainty. Refer to Part I, Item
1A. Risk Factors for a discussion of these challenges.
In November 2018, we announced plans to accelerate steps to improve our overall business performance, including the
reorganization of global product development staffs, the realignment of manufacturing capacity in response to market-related
volume declines in passenger cars and a reduction of our salaried workforce. We achieved $4.5 billion in cost savings primarily
from reductions in Automotive and other cost of sales and Automotive and other selling, general and administrative expense in our
consolidated financial statements, inclusive of $0.2 billion of savings related to the wind-down of Holden sales, design and
engineering operations and sale of our vehicle and powertrain manufacturing facilities in Thailand. We previously announced plans
to reduce capital expenditures from approximately $8.5 billion to approximately $7.0 billion on a normalized run-rate basis. As a
result of re-timing 2020 spending due to pandemic-related austerity measures into 2021 and a strategic decision to accelerate
investments in our all-electric future beginning in 2021, we expect that our annual capital expenditures will exceed $7.0 billion
through at least 2023. As we continue to assess our performance and the needs of our evolving business, additional restructuring
and rationalization actions could be required. These actions could give rise to future asset impairments or other charges, which may
have a material impact on our operating results.
GMNA Industry sales in North America were 17.7 million units in the year ended December 31, 2020, representing a decrease of
16.2% compared to the corresponding period in 2019. U.S. industry sales were 14.9 million units in the year ended December 31,
2020, representing a decrease of 14.7% compared to the corresponding period in 2019. As described above, the COVID-19
pandemic has resulted in a contraction of total North America industry volumes in 2020. Dealer inventory remains constrained for
several critical vehicles, including our full-size trucks.
Our total vehicle sales in the U.S., our largest market in North America, were 2.5 million units for a market share of 17.1% in the
year ended December 31, 2020, representing an increase of 0.6 percentage points compared to the corresponding period in 2019.
We continue to lead the U.S. industry in market share.
As discussed above, in response to COVID-19, we suspended production across our manufacturing facilities in March 2020. By
May 2020, we had resumed critical manufacturing operations and reached normalized production levels in June 2020. We continue
to follow physical distancing guidance, enhanced deep cleaning procedures and provide personal protective equipment to protect
our employees.
We estimate GMNA's breakeven point at the U.S. industry level to be in the range of 10.0 to 11.0 million units. The extent of
COVID-19's impact on industry volumes in 2021 will ultimately depend upon, among other things, the duration and severity of the
outbreak or subsequent outbreaks, related government responses, the pace of recovery of economic activity and the impact to
consumers, the effectiveness of available vaccines and any potential supply disruptions, all of which are uncertain and difficult to
predict in light of the rapidly evolving landscape.
GMI Industry sales in China were 24.9 million units in the year ended December 31, 2020, representing a decrease of 1.9%
compared to the corresponding period in 2019. Our total vehicle sales in China were 2.9 million units for a market share of 11.6%
in the year ended December 31, 2020, representing a decrease of 0.5 percentage points compared to the corresponding period in
2019. While we have observed a recovery of the market as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in China subsides, the ongoing
global macro-economic impact of COVID-19 and geopolitical tensions may continue to place pressure on China's

automotive industry. Our Automotive China JVs generated equity income of $0.5 billion in the year ended December 31, 2020.
Although a continuation of a competitive industry, pricing pressures and a more challenging regulatory environment related to
emissions, fuel consumption and new energy vehicles will continue to place pressure on our operations in China, we will continue
to build upon our strong brands, network, and partnerships in China as well as continue to drive improvements in vehicle mix and
cost.
Outside of China, industry sales were 21.1 million units in the year ended December 31, 2020, representing a decrease of 18.0%
compared to the corresponding period in 2019, primarily due to the global macroeconomic impact of COVID-19. Our total vehicle
sales were 1.0 million units for a market share of 4.7% in the year ended December 31, 2020, representing a decrease of 0.1
percentage points compared to the corresponding period in 2019.
In the year ended December 31, 2020, restructuring actions in GMI were related to the wind-down of Holden sales, design and
engineering operations in Australia and New Zealand, with cessation of Holden vehicle sales by 2021, the sale of our vehicle and
powertrain manufacturing facilities in Thailand, and the execution of a binding term sheet to sell our manufacturing facilities in
India. These actions were taken to strengthen the Company's core business and focus investment on other opportunities that will
derive the greatest returns for shareholders and support investment in future technologies. We recorded charges of $0.7 billion in
the year ended December 31, 2020. We also recorded deferred tax charges of $0.2 billion in the year ended December 31, 2020.
The charges were primarily considered special for EBIT-adjusted, EPS-diluted-adjusted and adjusted automotive free cash flow
purposes. We intend to continue to provide servicing and spare parts to customers for an extended period of time in Australia, New
Zealand, Thailand and India. Refer to Note 18 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information related to these
restructuring actions.
Cruise We are actively testing our autonomous vehicles in the U.S. Gated by safety and regulation, we continue to make
significant progress towards commercialization of a network of on-demand autonomous vehicles in the U.S.
Automotive Financing - GM Financial Summary and Outlook We believe that offering a comprehensive suite of financing
products will generate incremental sales of our vehicles, drive incremental GM Financial earnings and help support our sales
throughout various economic cycles. GM Financial's leasing program is exposed to residual values, which are heavily dependent on
used vehicle prices. Used vehicle prices increased approximately 3% in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to low new vehicle
inventory, largely driven by the suspension of manufacturing operations as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, creating strong
demand for used vehicles, which resulted in gains on terminations of leased vehicles of $1.3 billion in GM Financial interest,
operating and other expenses in the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to gains of $0.7 billion in the corresponding period
in 2019. Further, vehicles sold during 2020 were carried at lower net book values, resulting from increased depreciation rates
recorded in anticipation of reduced residual values throughout 2020. In 2021, GM Financial expects used vehicle prices to decline
by an amount in the low single digits on a percentage basis as compared to 2020 levels as supply and demand dynamics normalize.
The following table summarizes the estimated residual value based on GM Financial's most recent estimates and the number of
units included in GM Financial Equipment on operating leases, net by vehicle type (units in thousands):
December 31, 2020 December 31, 2019

GM Financial's penetration of our retail sales in the U.S. increased to 45% in the year ended December 31, 2020 from 43% in
2019. Penetration levels vary depending on incentive financing programs available and competing third-party financing products in
the market. GM Financial's prime loan originations as a percentage of total loan originations in North America increased to 73% in
2020 from 68% in 2019. In the year ended December 31, 2020, GM Financial's revenue consisted of leased vehicle income of 69%,
retail finance charge income of 26%, and commercial finance charge income of 3%.
Consolidated Results We review changes in our results of operations under five categories: volume, mix, price, cost and other.
Volume measures the impact of changes in wholesale vehicle volumes driven by industry volume, market share and changes in
dealer stock levels. Mix measures the impact of changes to the regional portfolio due to product, model, trim,

The most significant element of our Automotive and other cost of sales is material cost, which makes up approximately two-
thirds of the total amount. The remaining portion includes labor costs, depreciation and amortization, engineering, freight and
product warranty and recall campaigns.
Factors that most significantly influence a region's profitability are industry volume, market share, and the relative mix of
vehicles (trucks, crossovers, cars) sold. Variable profit is a key indicator of product profitability. Variable profit is defined as
revenue less material cost, freight, the variable component of manufacturing expense and warranty and recall-related costs. Vehicles
with higher selling prices generally have higher variable profit. Refer to the regional sections of this MD&A for additional
information on volume and mix.
In the year ended December 31, 2020, favorable Cost was primarily due to: (1) charges of $1.7 billion primarily related to
accelerated depreciation and supplier-related charges resulting from transformation activities in 2019; (2) favorable cost of $1.5
billion primarily due to the impact of COVID-19, inclusive of the suspension of production and austerity measures as well as cost
savings associated with transformation activities and savings related to the wind-down of Holden sales, design and engineering
operations and sale of our vehicle and powertrain manufacturing facilities in Thailand; and (3) decreased costs of $0.3 billion
related to parts and accessories sales; partially offset by (4) a benefit of $1.4 billion related to the retrospective recoveries of
indirect taxes in Brazil in 2019; (5) increased material and freight costs of $0.9 billion; (6) charges of $0.7 billion

primarily related to dealer restructuring charges, property and intangible asset impairments, inventory provisions and employee
separation charges in Australia, New Zealand, Thailand and India; and (7) increased costs of $0.4 billion primarily due to the
Takata Corporation (Takata) recall of $1.1 billion partially offset by decreased other campaign and warranty-related costs. In the
year ended December 31, 2020 favorable Other was due to the foreign currency effect resulting from the weakening of the
Brazilian Real and other currencies against the U.S. Dollar.

GMNA Total Net Sales and Revenue In the year ended December 31, 2020, Total net sales and revenue decreased primarily due
to: (1) decreased net wholesale volumes across most vehicle lines as a result of suspending production due to the COVID-19
pandemic, partially offset by lost production volumes associated with the UAW strike in 2019; and (2) unfavorable Other primarily
due to decreased sales of parts and accessories due to the COVID-19 pandemic and foreign currency effect resulting from the
weakening of the Mexican Peso against the U.S. Dollar; partially offset by (3) favorable price primarily due to full-size SUVs,
pickup trucks and crossover vehicles; and (4) favorable mix associated with decreased sales of passenger cars and crossover
vehicles, improved mix associated with our new full-size pickup trucks, partially offset by decreased sales of full-size SUVs.
GMNA EBIT-Adjusted The most significant factors that influence profitability are industry volume and market share. While not
as significant as industry volume and market share, another factor affecting profitability is the relative mix of vehicles sold. Trucks,
crossovers and cars sold currently have a variable profit of approximately 160%, 60% and 30% of our GMNA portfolio on a
weighted-average basis.
In the year ended December 31, 2020, EBIT-adjusted increased primarily due to: (1) favorable price; (2) favorable Cost due to
savings in advertising, manufacturing, engineering and other administrative and selling of $2.1 billion, inclusive of the suspension
of production and austerity measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic as well as transformation activities; partially offset by

Liquidity and Capital Resources As described in the “Overview” section of this MD&A, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a
material impact on our financial results and it may have a material impact on future periods, including our cash flows from
operating activities and liquidity. The extent of the impact of COVID-19 on our liquidity will depend upon, among other things, the
duration and severity of the outbreak or subsequent outbreaks, related government responses, such as required physical distancing
or restrictions on business operations and travel, the pace of recovery of economic activity and the impact to consumers, the
effectiveness of available vaccines and any potential supply disruptions, all of which are uncertain and difficult to predict. Refer to
Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors for a full discussion of the risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.
During 2020, to preserve financial flexibility in light of the uncertainty in global markets resulting from the COVID-19
pandemic, we borrowed $15.9 billion under our revolving credit facilities, extended a portion of our revolving credit facilities for
an additional year, issued $4.0 billion in senior unsecured notes and entered into a new unsecured 364-day, $2.0 billion revolving
credit facility. We repaid all amounts drawn under the revolving credit facilities as of December 31, 2020. See the "Automotive
Liquidity" section of this MD&A for additional information on these liquidity actions.
Despite the uncertainty resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, we believe our current levels of cash, cash equivalents, and
marketable debt securities, available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facilities and other liquidity actions currently
available to us are sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements. We also maintain access to the capital markets and may issue debt
or equity securities, which may provide an additional source of liquidity. We have substantial cash requirements going forward,
which we plan to fund through our total available liquidity, cash flows from operating activities and additional liquidity measures,
if determined to be necessary.
The following summarizes aggregated information about our material short and long-term cash requirements from our known
contractual and other obligations:
Payments Due by Period
2021 2022-2023 2024-2025 2026 and after Total
Automotive debt $ 1,199 $ 2,619 $ 2,618 11,260 17,696 
Automotive Financing debt 35,742 34,579 14,417 7,277 92,015 
Automotive interest payments(a) 947 1,807 1,532 8,439 12,725 
Automotive Financing interest payments(b) 2,072 2,329 955 443 5,799 
Operating lease obligations 266 436 312 498 1,512 
Material 2,496 1,593 71 18 4,178 
__________
(a) Amounts include automotive interest payments based on contractual terms and current interest rates on our debt and finance lease
obligations. Automotive interest payments based on variable interest rates were determined using the interest rate in effect at December 31,
2020.
(b) GM Financial interest payments were determined using the interest rate in effect at December 31, 2020 for floating rate debt and the
contractual rates for fixed rate debt. GM Financial interest payments on floating rate tranches of the securitization notes payable were
converted to a fixed rate based on the floating rate plus any expected hedge payments.
Our known current material uses of cash include, among other possible demands: (1) capital expenditures of approximately $9.0
billion to $10.0 billion in 2021 in addition to payments for engineering and product development activities; (2) payments associated
with previously announced vehicle recalls, the settlements of the multi-district litigation and any other recall-related contingencies;
and (3) payments to service debt and other long-term obligations, including discretionary and mandatory contributions to our
pension plans. Our material future uses of cash, which may vary from time to time based on market conditions and other factors,
are focused on the three objectives of our capital allocation program: (1) grow our business at an average target ROIC-adjusted rate
of 20% or greater; (2) maintain a strong investment-grade balance sheet, including a target average automotive cash balance of $18
billion; and (3) after the first two objectives are met, return available cash to shareholders. Our senior management evaluates our
capital allocation program on an ongoing basis and recommends any modifications to the program to our Board of Directors, not
less than once annually.
Our liquidity plans are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those described in the "Forward-Looking
Statements" section of this MD&A and Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors, some of which are outside of our control.

GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES
We continue to monitor and evaluate opportunities to strengthen our competitive position over the long term while maintaining a
strong investment-grade balance sheet. These actions may include opportunistic payments to reduce our long-term obligations, as
well as the possibility of acquisitions, dispositions, investments with joint venture partners and strategic alliances that we believe
would generate significant advantages and substantially strengthen our business.
In January 2017, we announced that our Board of Directors had authorized the purchase of up to $5.0 billion of our common
stock with no expiration date, as part of our common stock repurchase program. We have completed $1.7 billion of the $5.0 billion
program through December 31, 2020.
Cash flows occur amongst our Automotive, Cruise and GM Financial operations that are eliminated when we consolidate our
cash flows. Such eliminations include, among other things, collections by Automotive on wholesale accounts receivables financed
by dealers through GM Financial, payments between Automotive and GM Financial for accounts receivables transferred by
Automotive to GM Financial, loans to Automotive from GM Financial, dividends issued by GM Financial to Automotive and
Automotive cash injections in Cruise. The presentation of Automotive liquidity, Cruise liquidity and GM Financial liquidity
presented below includes the impact of cash transactions amongst the sectors that are ultimately eliminated in consolidation.
Automotive Liquidity Total available liquidity includes cash, cash equivalents, marketable debt securities and funds available
under credit facilities. The amount of available liquidity is subject to seasonal fluctuations and includes balances held by various
business units and subsidiaries worldwide that are needed to fund their operations.
We manage our liquidity primarily at our treasury centers as well as at certain of our significant consolidated overseas
subsidiaries. Over 90% of our cash and marketable debt securities were managed within North America and at our regional treasury
centers at December 31, 2020. We have used and will continue to use other methods including intercompany loans to utilize these
funds across our global operations as needed.
Our cash equivalents and marketable debt securities balances are primarily denominated in U.S. Dollars and include investments
in U.S. government and agency obligations, foreign government securities, time deposits, corporate debt securities and mortgage
and asset-backed securities. Our investment guidelines, which we may change from time to time, prescribe certain minimum credit
worthiness thresholds and limit our exposures to any particular sector, asset class, issuance or security type. The majority of our
current investments in debt securities are with A/A2 or better rated issuers.
We use credit facilities as a mechanism to provide additional flexibility in managing our global liquidity. At December 31, 2019,
the total size of our credit facilities was $17.5 billion, which consisted principally of three revolving credit facilities. In May 2020,
as an additional source of available liquidity, we entered into a fourth facility, increasing the size of our credit facilities to $18.5
billion. These facilities consist of a three-year, $4.0 billion facility that includes a letter of credit sub-facility of $1.1 billion, a five-
year, $10.5 billion facility, a three-year, $2.0 billion transformation facility and a 364-day, $2.0 billion revolving credit facility
entered into in May 2020. Total borrowing capacity under our automotive credit facilities does not include a 364-day, $2.0 billion
facility designated for exclusive use by GM Financial.
In April 2020, we renewed our 364-day, $2.0 billion facility designated for exclusive use by GM Financial for an additional 364-
day term and extended $3.6 billion of the three-year, $4.0 billion facility for an additional year expiring in April 2022. The
remaining portion will expire in April 2021, unless extended. As part of the extension of the three-year, $4.0 billion facility, we
agreed not to execute any share repurchases while we have any outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facilities, except
for the three-year, $2.0 billion transformation facility. In addition, we are restricted from paying dividends on our common shares if
outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facilities exceed $5.0 billion, with the exception of the three-year, $2.0 billion
transformation facility.
In 2020, we borrowed $3.4 billion against our three-year, $4.0 billion facility, $2.0 billion against our three-year, $2.0 billion
transformation facility and $10.5 billion against our five-year, $10.5 billion facility. We repaid all amounts drawn under the
revolving credit facilities as of December 31, 2020. We had letters of credit outstanding under our sub-facility of $0.3 billion and
$0.2 billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019.
If available capacity permits, GM Financial has access to our revolving credit facilities, except for the three-year, $2.0 billion
transformation facility and the new 364-day $2.0 billion facility. GM Financial did not have borrowings outstanding against our
revolving credit facilities at December 31, 2020 and 2019. Refer to Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for additional
information on credit facilities. We had intercompany loans from GM Financial of $0.4 billion and $0.5 billion at

GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES
December 31, 2020 and 2019, which primarily consisted of commercial loans to dealers we consolidate, and we had no
intercompany loans to GM Financial. Refer to Note 5 of our consolidated financial statements for additional information.
In May 2020, we issued $4.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes with a weighted average interest
rate of 6.11% and maturity dates ranging from 2023 to 2027. The notes are governed by a sixth supplemental indenture and the
same base indenture that governs our existing notes, which contains terms and covenants customary for these types of securities,
including a limitation on the amount of certain secured debt we may incur. The net proceeds from the issuance of these senior
unsecured notes provide additional financial flexibility and will be used for general corporate purposes. In August 2020, we repaid
$0.5 billion of our floating rate senior unsecured debt upon maturity.
Several of our loan facilities, including our revolving credit facilities, require compliance with certain financial and operational
covenants as well as regular reporting to lenders. We have reviewed our covenants in effect as of December 31, 2020 and
determined we are in compliance and expect to remain in compliance in the future.
GM Financial's Board of Directors declared and paid dividends of $0.8 billion and $0.4 billion on its common stock in 2020 and
2019. Future dividends from GM Financial will depend on a number of factors including business and economic conditions, its
financial condition, earnings, liquidity requirements and leverage ratio.

automotive cash provided by operating activities under U.S. GAAP was $7.5 billion, capital expenditures were $5.3 billion and
adjustments for management actions, primarily related to GMI restructuring, were $0.3 billion. For the year ended December 31,
2019, net automotive cash provided by operating activities under U.S. GAAP was $7.4 billion, capital expenditures were $7.5
billion and adjustments for management actions, primarily related to transformation activities, were $1.2 billion.
Status of Credit Ratings We receive ratings from four independent credit rating agencies: DBRS Limited (DBRS), Fitch Ratings
(Fitch), Moody's Investor Service (Moody's) and Standard & Poor's (S&P). All four credit rating agencies currently rate our
corporate credit at investment grade. The following table summarizes our credit ratings at January 29, 2021:

Cruise Liquidity
The changes in our Cruise available liquidity in the year ended December 31, 2020 were primarily driven by operating cash flow.
In January 2021, Cruise Holdings issued Class G Preferred Shares in exchange for $2.2 billion from Microsoft and other investors,
including $1.0 billion from General Motors Holdings LLC. Refer to Note 26 to our consolidated financial statements for additional
information. When Cruise's autonomous vehicles are ready for commercial deployment, Softbank Vision Fund (AIV M2), L.P. (The
Vision Fund) is obligated to purchase additional convertible preferred shares (Cruise Preferred Shares) for $1.35 billion.

Automotive Financing – GM Financial Liquidity GM Financial's primary sources of cash are finance charge income, leasing
income and proceeds from the sale of terminated leased vehicles, net distributions from credit facilities, securitizations, secured and
unsecured borrowings and collections and recoveries on finance receivables. GM Financial's primary uses of cash are purchases of
retail finance receivables and leased vehicles, the funding of commercial finance receivables, repayment or repurchases of secured
and unsecured debt, funding credit enhancement requirements in connection with securitizations and secured credit facilities,
interest costs, operating expenses and dividend payments. The following table summarizes GM Financial's available liquidity

GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES
In the year ended December 31, 2020, available liquidity increased primarily due to an increase in cash and cash equivalents and
available borrowing capacity on unpledged eligible assets, resulting from the issuance of securitization transactions, unsecured debt
and preferred stock. GM Financial structures liquidity to support at least six months of GM Financial's expected net cash outflows,
including new originations, without access to new debt financing transactions or other capital markets activity.
GM Financial has access to $16.5 billion of our revolving credit facilities with exclusive access to the 364-day, $2.0 billion
facility. Refer to the "Automotive Liquidity" section of this MD&A for additional details. We have a support agreement with GM
Financial which, among other things, establishes commitments of funding from us to GM Financial. This agreement also provides
that we will continue to own all of GM Financial’s outstanding voting shares so long as any unsecured debt securities remain
outstanding at GM Financial. In addition, we are required to use our commercially reasonable efforts to ensure GM Financial
remains a subsidiary borrower under our corporate revolving credit facilities.
Credit Facilities In the normal course of business, in addition to using its available cash, GM Financial utilizes borrowings under
its credit facilities, which may be secured or unsecured, and GM Financial repays these borrowings as appropriate under its cash
management strategy. At December 31, 2020, secured, committed unsecured and uncommitted unsecured credit facilities totaled
$26.2 billion, $0.5 billion and $1.5 billion with advances outstanding of $3.7 billion, an insignificant amount and $1.5 billion.

In the year ended December 31, 2020, Net cash provided by operating activities decreased primarily due to: (1) a decrease in
leased vehicle income of $0.5 billion; and (2) a decrease in derivative collateral posting activities of $0.1 billion; partially offset by
(3) a decrease in interest paid of $0.5 billion.
In the year ended December 31, 2020, Net cash used in investing activities increased primarily due to: (1) increased purchases of
finance receivables of $4.9 billion; and (2) decreased collections and recoveries on finance receivables of $0.7 billion; partially
offset by (3) decreased purchases of leased vehicles of $1.2 billion.
In the year ended December 31, 2020, Net cash provided by financing activities increased primarily due to: (1) an increase in
borrowings of $22.2 billion; and (2) issuance of preferred stock of $0.5 billion; partially offset by (3) an increase in debt
repayments of $16.4 billion; and (4) an increase in dividend payments of $0.4 billion.

Critical Accounting Estimates The consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which requires
the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses in the
periods presented. We believe the accounting estimates employed are appropriate and the resulting balances are reasonable;
however, due to the inherent uncertainties in developing estimates, actual results could differ from the original estimates, requiring
adjustments to these balances in future periods. Refer to Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for our significant
accounting policies related to our critical accounting estimates.

GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES
Product Warranty and Recall Campaigns The estimates related to product warranties are established using historical
information on the nature, frequency and average cost of claims of each vehicle line or each model year of the vehicle line and
assumptions about future activity and events. When little or no claims experience exists for a model year or a vehicle line, the
estimate is based on comparable models.
We accrue the costs related to product warranty at the time of vehicle sale and we accrue the estimated cost of recall campaigns
when they are probable and estimable, which is generally at the time of sale.
The estimates related to recall campaigns accrued at the time of vehicle sale are established by applying a paid loss approach that
considers the number of historical recall campaigns and the estimated cost for each recall campaign. These estimates consider the
nature, frequency and magnitude of historical recall campaigns, and use key assumptions including the number of historical periods
and the weighting of historical data in the reserve studies. Costs associated with recall campaigns not accrued at the time of vehicle
sale are estimated based on the estimated cost of repairs and the estimated vehicles to be repaired. Depending on part availability
and time to complete repairs we may, from time to time, offer courtesy transportation at no cost to our customers. These estimates
are re-evaluated on an ongoing basis and based on the best available information. Revisions are made when necessary based on
changes in these factors.
The estimated amount accrued for recall campaigns at the time of vehicle sale is most sensitive to the estimated number of recall
events, the number of vehicles per recall event, the assumed number of vehicles that will be brought in by customers for repair
(take rate) and the cost per vehicle for each recall event. The estimated cost of a recall campaign that is accrued on an individual
basis is most sensitive to our estimated assumed take rate that is primarily developed based on our historical take rate experience. A
10% increase in the estimated take rate for all recall campaigns would increase the estimated cost by approximately $0.4 billion.
Actual experience could differ from the amounts estimated requiring adjustments to these liabilities in future periods. Due to the
uncertainty and potential volatility of the factors contributing to developing estimates, changes in our assumptions could materially
affect our results of operations.
Sales Incentives The estimated effect of sales incentives offered to dealers and end customers is recorded as a reduction of
Automotive net sales and revenue at the time of sale. There may be numerous types of incentives available at any particular time.
Incentive programs are generally specific to brand, model or sales region and are for specified time periods, which may be
extended. Significant factors used in estimating the cost of incentives include type of program, forecasted sales volume, product
mix, and the rate of customer acceptance of incentive programs, all of which are estimated based on historical experience and
assumptions concerning future customer behavior and market conditions. A change in any of these factors affecting the estimate
could have a significant effect on recorded sales incentives. A 10% increase in the cost of incentives would increase the sales
incentive liability by approximately $0.3 billion. Subsequent adjustments to incentive estimates are possible as facts and
circumstances change over time, which could affect the revenue previously recognized in Automotive net sales and revenue.
GM Financial Allowance for Loan Losses The GM Financial retail finance receivables portfolio consists of smaller-balance,
homogeneous loans that are carried at amortized cost, net of allowance for loan losses. The allowance for loan losses on retail
finance receivables reflects net credit losses expected to be incurred over the remaining life of the retail finance receivables, which
have a weighted average remaining life of approximately two years. We forecast net credit losses based on relevant information
about past events, current conditions and forecast economic performance. We believe that the allowance is adequate to cover
expected credit losses on the retail finance receivables; however, because the allowance for loan losses is based on estimates, there
can be no assurance that the ultimate charge-off amount will not exceed such estimates or that our credit loss assumptions will not
increase.
GM Financial incorporates assumptions about forecast charge-off recovery rates and overall economic performance in its
allowance estimate. Used vehicle prices rebounded in the second half of 2020 after decreasing in March and April 2020, and
recoveries outperformed the forecast. Therefore, GM Financial increased its recovery rate forecast as of December 31, 2020. Each
5% relative decrease/increase in the forecast recovery rates could increase/decrease our allowance for loan losses by approximately
$0.1 billion.
GM Financial updated its forecast of economic performance in March 2020, following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, and
has continued to monitor and update the forecast through December 31, 2020. At December 31, 2020, the weightings applied to the
economic forecast scenarios considered resulted in an allowance for loan losses on the retail finance receivables portfolio of $1.9
billion. Using different possible weightings that GM Financial could apply to the economic forecast scenarios
40
Table of Contents
GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES
result in an allowance for loan losses ranging from $1.8 billion to $2.0 billion. Actual economic data and recovery rates that are
lower than those forecasted by GM Financial could result in an increase to the allowance for loan losses.
The GM Financial commercial finance receivables portfolio consists of floorplan financing as well as dealer loans, which are
loans to finance improvements to dealership facilities, to provide working capital, and to purchase and/or finance dealership real
estate. The allowance for loan losses on commercial finance receivables is also based on estimates that, effective January 1, 2020,
include historical loss experience for the consolidated portfolio, as well as the forecast for industry vehicle sales. There can be no
assurance that the ultimate charge-off amount will not exceed such estimates or that GM Financial's credit loss assumptions will not
increase.
Valuation of GM Financial Equipment on Operating Lease Assets and Residuals GM Financial has investments in leased
vehicles recorded as operating leases, which relate to vehicle leases to retail customers with lease terms that typically range from
two to five years. At lease inception an estimate is made of the expected residual value at the end of the lease term. The expected
residual value is based on third-party data that considers various data points and assumptions, including, but not limited to, recent
auction values, the expected future volume of returning leased vehicles, used vehicle prices, manufacturer incentive programs and
fuel prices. Realization of the residual values is dependent on the future ability to market the vehicles under prevailing market
conditions. The customer is obligated to make payments during the lease term for the difference between the purchase price and the
contract residual value plus a money factor. However, since the customer is not obligated to purchase the vehicle at the end of the
contract, GM Financial is exposed to a risk of loss to the extent the customer returns the vehicle prior to or at the end of the lease
term and the value of the vehicle is lower than the residual value estimated at lease inception.
The following table summarizes vehicles included in GM Financial equipment on operating leases, net (vehicles in thousands):
December 31, 2020 December 31, 2019
Crossovers 964 972 
Trucks 275 288 
SUVs 92 108 
Cars 140 238 
Total 1,471 1,606 
At December 31, 2020, the estimated residual value of GM Financial's leased vehicles was $29.2 billion. Depreciation reduces
the carrying value of each leased asset in GM Financial's operating lease portfolio over time from its original acquisition value to
its expected residual value at the end of the lease term.
GM Financial updated the residual value estimates on the operating lease portfolio to reflect the decrease in forecasted used
vehicle prices in March 2020, following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, and has continued to monitor and update the
residual value estimates through December 31, 2020. Used vehicle prices rebounded in the second half of 2020 after decreasing in
March and April 2020, and sales proceeds on terminated leased vehicles outperformed the residual value estimates during the year
ended December 31, 2020. Accordingly, GM Financial increased the residual value estimates at December 31, 2020, which will
result in a prospective decrease in the depreciation rate over the remaining term of the leased vehicle portfolio. If used vehicle
prices decrease, GM Financial would increase depreciation expense and/or record an impairment charge on the lease portfolio. If an
impairment exists, GM Financial would determine any shortfall in recoverability of the leased vehicle asset groups by year, make
and model. Recoverability is calculated as the excess of: (1) the sum of remaining lease payments plus estimated residual value;
over (2) leased vehicles, net less deferred revenue. Alternatively, if used vehicle prices outperform GM Financial's latest estimates,
it may record gains on sales of off-lease vehicles and/or decreased depreciation expense.

GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES
The following table illustrates the effect of a 1% relative change in the estimated residual values at December 31, 2020, which
could increase or decrease depreciation expense over the remaining term of the leased vehicle portfolio, holding all other
assumptions constant (dollars in millions):
Impact to Depreciation
Expense
2021 $ 198 
2022 72 
2023 21 
2024 and thereafter 1 
Total $ 292 
Changes to residual values are rarely simultaneous across all maturities and segments, and also may impact return rates. If a
decrease in residual values is concentrated among specific asset groups, the decrease could result in an immediate impairment
charge. GM Financial reviewed the leased vehicle portfolio for indicators of impairment and determined that no impairment
indicators were present at December 31, 2020 and 2019.
Used vehicle prices increased approximately 3% in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to low new vehicle inventory, largely
driven by the suspension of manufacturing operations as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, creating strong demand for used
vehicles. In 2021, GM Financial expects used vehicle prices to decline by an amount in the low single digits on a percentage basis
compared to 2020 levels as supply and demand dynamics normalize.
Pension and OPEB Plans Our defined benefit pension plans are accounted for on an actuarial basis, which requires the selection
of various assumptions, including an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, a discount rate, mortality rates of participants
and expectation of mortality improvement. Our pension obligations include Korean statutory pension payments that are valued on a
walk away basis. The expected long-term rate of return on U.S. plan assets that is utilized in determining pension expense is
derived from periodic studies, which include a review of asset allocation strategies, anticipated future long-term performance of
individual asset classes, risks using standard deviations and correlations of returns among the asset classes that comprise the plans'
asset mix. While the studies give appropriate consideration to recent plan performance and historical returns, the assumptions are
primarily long-term, prospective rates of return.
In December 2020, an investment policy study was completed for the U.S. pension plans. As a result of changes to our capital
market assumptions, the weighted-average long-term rate of return on assets decreased from 5.9% at December 31, 2019 to 5.6% at
December 31, 2020. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets used in determining pension expense for non-U.S. plans is
determined in a similar manner to the U.S. plans.
Another key assumption in determining net pension and OPEB expense is the assumed discount rate used to discount plan
obligations. We estimate the assumed discount rate for U.S. plans using a cash flow matching approach, which uses projected cash
flows matched to spot rates along a high quality corporate bond yield curve to determine the weighted-average discount rate for the
calculation of the present value of cash flows. We apply the individual annual yield curve rates instead of the assumed discount rate
to determine the service cost and interest cost, which more specifically links the cash flows related to service cost and interest cost
to bonds maturing in their year of payment.
The Society of Actuaries (SOA) issued mortality improvement tables in the three months ended December 31, 2020. We
incorporated these SOA mortality improvement tables into our December 31, 2020 measurement of U.S. pension and OPEB plans'
benefit obligations. The change in these assumptions decreased the December 31, 2020 U.S. pension and OPEB plans’ obligations
by $0.7 billion.
Significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect the pension obligations.
The effects of actual results differing from assumptions and the changing of assumptions are included in unamortized net actuarial
gains and losses that are subject to amortization to pension expense over future periods. The unamortized pre-tax actuarial loss on
our pension plans was $8.4 billion and $6.7 billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019. The year-over-year change is primarily due to a
decrease in discount rates partially offset by higher than expected asset returns.
42
Table of Contents
GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES
The underfunded status of the U.S. pension plans remained unchanged in the year ended December 31, 2020 at $5.4 billion
primarily due to: (1) the unfavorable effect of a decrease in discount rates of $5.6 billion; and (2) service and interest costs of $1.9
billion; partially offset by (3) a favorable effect of actual returns on plan assets of $6.6 billion; and (4) changes in mortality
improvement assumptions and demographic gains of $0.9 billion.

strategies, assumptions, the change in benefit obligations and related plan assets, pension funding requirements and future net
benefit payments. Refer to Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the inputs used to determine fair
value for each significant asset class or category.
Valuation of Deferred Tax Assets The ability to realize deferred tax assets depends on the ability to generate sufficient taxable
income within the carryback or carryforward periods provided for in the tax law for each applicable tax jurisdiction. The
assessment regarding whether a valuation allowance is required or should be adjusted is based on an evaluation of possible sources
of taxable income and also considers all available positive and negative evidence factors. Our accounting for the valuation of
deferred tax assets represents our best estimate of future events. Changes in our current estimates due to unanticipated market
conditions and governmental legislative actions or events, could have a material effect on our ability to utilize deferred tax assets.
Refer to Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on the composition of valuation allowances.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
The overall financial risk management program is under the responsibility of the Chief Financial Officer with support from the
Financial Risk Council, which reviews and, where appropriate, approves strategies to be pursued to mitigate these risks. The
Financial Risk Council comprises members of our management and functions under the oversight of the Audit Committee and
Finance Committee of the Board of Directors. The Audit Committee and Finance Committee assist and guide the Board of
Directors in its oversight of our financial and risk management strategies. A risk management control framework is utilized to
monitor the strategies, risks and related hedge positions in accordance with the policies and procedures approved by the Financial
Risk Council. Our financial risk management policy is designed to protect against risk arising from extreme adverse market
movements on our key exposures.
Automotive The following analyses provide quantitative information regarding exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk,
interest rate risk and equity price risk. Sensitivity analysis is used to measure the potential loss in the fair value of financial
instruments with exposure to market risk. The models used assume instantaneous, parallel shifts in exchange rates and interest rate
yield curves. For options and other instruments with nonlinear returns, models appropriate to these types of instruments are utilized
to determine the effect of market shifts. There are certain shortcomings inherent in the sensitivity analyses presented, primarily due
to the assumption that interest rates change in a parallel fashion and that spot exchange rates change instantaneously. In addition,
the analyses are unable to reflect the complex market reactions that normally would arise from the market shifts modeled and do
not contemplate the effects of correlations between foreign currency exposures and offsetting long-short positions in currency or
other exposures, such as interest rates, which may significantly reduce the potential loss in value.
Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk We have foreign currency exposures related to buying, selling and financing in
currencies other than the functional currencies of our operations. At December 31, 2020, our most significant foreign currency
exposures were between the U.S. Dollar and the Canadian Dollar, Korean Won, Euro, Chinese Yuan, Brazilian Real and Mexican
Peso. Derivative instruments such as foreign currency forwards, swaps and options are primarily used to hedge
44
Table of Contents
GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES
exposures with respect to forecasted revenues, costs and commitments denominated in foreign currencies. Such contracts had
remaining maturities of up to 12 months at December 31, 2020.
 
The net fair value liability of financial instruments with exposure to foreign currency risk was $0.9 billion and $1.4 billion at
December 31, 2020 and 2019. These amounts are calculated utilizing a population of foreign currency exchange derivatives and
foreign currency denominated debt and exclude the offsetting effect of foreign currency cash, cash equivalents and other assets. The
potential loss in fair value for such financial instruments from a 10% adverse change in all quoted foreign currency exchange rates
would have been $0.1 billion and $0.2 billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019.
We are exposed to foreign currency risk due to the translation and remeasurement of the results of certain international operations
into U.S. Dollars as part of the consolidation process. We had foreign currency derivatives with notional amounts of $2.2 billion
and $5.1 billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019. The fair value of these derivative financial instruments was insignificant.
Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can therefore create volatility in the results of operations and may adversely affect
our financial condition.
The following table summarizes the amounts of automotive foreign currency translation and transaction and remeasurement
(gains) losses:
Years Ended December 31,
2020 2019
Translation losses recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss $ 387 $ 32 
Transaction and remeasurement (gains) losses recorded in earnings $ 209 $ (77)
Interest Rate Risk We are subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates related to certain financial
instruments, primarily debt, finance lease obligations and certain marketable debt securities. We did not have any interest rate swap
positions to manage interest rate exposures in our automotive operations at December 31, 2020 and 2019. The fair value of debt
and finance leases was $21.6 billion and $15.9 billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019. The potential increase in fair value resulting
from a 10% decrease in quoted interest rates would have been $0.7 billion and $0.6 billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019.     
We had marketable debt securities of $9.0 billion and $4.2 billion classified as available-for-sale at December 31, 2020 and 2019.
The potential decrease in fair value from a 50 basis point increase in interest rates would have had an insignificant effect at
December 31, 2020 and 2019.
Equity Price Risk We are subject to equity price risk due to market price volatility primarily related to our investment in PSA
warrants. The fair value of investments with exposure to equity price risk was $1.2 billion and $1.5 billion at December 31, 2020
and 2019. Our investment in PSA warrants is valued based on a Black-Scholes formula. We estimate that a 10% adverse change in

Interest Rate Risk Fluctuations in market interest rates can affect GM Financial's gross interest rate spread, which is the
difference between interest earned on finance receivables and interest paid on debt. GM Financial is exposed to interest rate risks as
financial assets and liabilities have different characteristics that may impact financial performance. These differences may include
tenor, yield, re-pricing timing, and prepayment expectations. Typically retail finance receivables and leases purchased by GM
Financial earn fixed interest and commercial finance receivables originated by GM Financial earn variable interest. GM Financial
funds its business with variable or fixed rate debt. The variable rate debt is subject to adjustments to reflect prevailing market
interest rates. To help mitigate interest rate risk or mismatched funding, GM Financial may employ hedging.
Quantitative Disclosure GM Financial measures the sensitivity of its net interest income to changes in interest rates by using
interest rate scenarios that assume a hypothetical, instantaneous parallel shift of one hundred basis points in all interest rates across
all maturities, as well as a base case that assumes that rates perform at the current market forward curve. However, interest rate
changes are rarely instantaneous or parallel and rates could move more or less than the one percentage point assumed in our
analysis. Therefore, the actual impact to net interest income could be higher or lower than the results detailed in

the table below. These interest rate scenarios are purely hypothetical and do not represent our view of future interest rate
movements.
At December 31, 2020, GM Financial was asset-sensitive, meaning that more assets than liabilities were expected to re-price
within the next twelve months. During a period of rising interest rates, the interest earned on assets would increase more than the
interest paid on liabilities, which would initially increase net interest income. During a period of falling interest rates, net interest
income would be expected to initially decrease. At December 31, 2019, GM Financial was liability-sensitive, meaning that more
liabilities than assets were expected to re-price within the next twelve months. During a period of rising interest rates, the interest
paid on liabilities would increase more than the interest earned on assets, which would initially decrease net interest income.
During a period of falling interest rates, net interest income would be expected to initially increase.
GM Financial's net interest income sensitivity increased in 2020 as compared to 2019 primarily due to an increased proportion of
rate sensitive asset exposure relative to rate sensitive liability exposure. GM Financial's hedging strategies approved by its global
asset liability committee are used to manage interest rate risk within policy guidelines. The following table presents GM Financial's
net interest income sensitivity to interest rate movement:
Years Ended December 31,
2020 2019
One hundred basis points instantaneous increase in interest rates $ 29.7 $ (4.6)
One hundred basis points instantaneous decrease in interest rates(a) $ (29.7)$ 4.6 
__________
(a)    Net interest income sensitivity given a one hund red basis point decrease in interest rates requires an assumption of negative interest rates in
markets where existing interest rates are below one percent.
Additional Model Assumptions The sensitivity analysis presented is GM Financial's best estimate of the effect of the
hypothetical interest rate scenarios; however, actual results could differ. The estimates are also based on assumptions including the
amortization and prepayment of the finance receivable portfolio, originations of finance receivables and leases, refinancing of
maturing debt, replacement of maturing derivatives and exercise of options embedded in debt and derivatives. The prepayment
projections are based on historical experience. If interest rates or other factors change, actual prepayment experience could be
different than projected.
Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk GM Financial is exposed to foreign currency risk due to the translation and
remeasurement of the results of certain international operations into U.S. Dollars as part of the consolidation process. Fluctuations
in foreign currency exchange rates can therefore create volatility in the results of operations and may adversely affect GM
Financial's financial condition.
GM Financial primarily finances its receivables and leased assets with debt in the same currency. When a different currency is
used GM Financial may use foreign currency swaps to convert substantially all of its foreign currency debt obligations to the local
currency of the receivables and leased assets to minimize any impact to earnings. As a result, GM Financial believes its market risk
exposure relating to changes in currency exchange rates at December 31, 2020 was insignificant.
GM Financial had foreign currency swaps with notional amounts of $7.6 billion and $6.2 billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019.
The net fair value of these derivative financial instruments was an asset of $0.4 billion and an insignificant amount at December 31,
2020 and 2019.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of General Motors Company
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of General Motors Company and subsidiaries (the Company) as of
December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, cash flows, and equity for
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial
statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at
December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2020, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)
(PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in
Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013
framework) and our report dated February 10, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required
to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error
or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements,
whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test
basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the
financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that
were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are
material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The
communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we
are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the
accounts or disclosures to which they relate.
Product warranty and recall campaigns
Description of the matter As discussed in Note 12 to the financial statements, the liabilities for product warranty and recall
campaigns amount to $8.2 billion at December 31, 2020. The Company accrues for costs related to
product warranty at the time of vehicle sale and accrues the estimated cost of recall campaigns
when they are probable and estimable, which is generally at the time of sale.
Auditing these liabilities involved a high degree of subjectivity in evaluating management’s
estimates, due to the size, uncertainties, and potential volatility related to the estimated liabilities.
Management’s estimates consider historical claims experience, including the nature, frequency, and
average cost of claims of each vehicle line or each model year of the vehicle line, and the key
assumptions of historical data being predictive of future activity and events, in particular, the
number of historical periods used and the weighing of historical data in the reserve studies.
47
Table of Contents
How we addressed the matter
in our auditWe evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls over the
Company’s product warranty and recall campaign processes. We tested internal controls over
management’s review of the valuation models and significant assumptions for product warranty
and recall including the warranty claims forecasted based on the frequency and average cost per
warranty claim for product warranty, and the cost estimates related to recall campaigns. Our audit
also included the evaluation of controls that address the completeness and accuracy of the data
utilized in the valuation models.
Our audit procedures related to product warranty and recall campaigns also included, among others,
evaluating the Company’s estimation methodology, the related significant assumptions and
underlying data, and performing analytical procedures to corroborate cost per vehicle based on
historical claims data. Furthermore, we performed sensitivity analyses to evaluate the significant
judgments made by management, including cost estimates to evaluate the impact on reserves from
changes in assumptions. We performed analysis over the vehicle lines and model years that had
little or no claims experience to ensure the vehicle and model substitutions are comparable. We also
involved actuarial specialists to evaluate the methodologies and assumptions, and to test the
actuarial calculations used by the Company.
Sales incentives
Description of the matter Automotive sales and revenue represents the amount of consideration to which the Company
expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or providing services, which is net of
dealer and customer sales incentives the Company expects to pay. As discussed in Note 2 to the
financial statements, provisions for dealer and customer incentives are recorded as a reduction to
Automotive net sales and revenue at the time of vehicle sale. The liabilities for dealer and customer
allowances, claims and discounts amount to $7.3 billion at December 31, 2020.
Auditing the estimate of sales incentives involved a high degree of judgment. Significant factors
used by the Company in estimating its liability for retail incentives include type of program,
forecasted sales volumes, product mix, and the rate of customer acceptance of incentive programs,
all of which are estimated based on historical experience and assumptions concerning future
customer behavior and market conditions. The Company’s estimation model reflects the best
estimate of the total incentive amount that the Company reasonably expects to pay at the time of
sale. The estimated cost of incentives is forward-looking, and could be materially affected by future
economic and market conditions.
How we addressed the matter
in our auditWe evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls over the
Company’s sales incentive process, including management’s review of the estimation model, the
significant assumptions (e.g., incentive cost per unit, customer take rate, and market conditions),
and the data inputs used in the model.
Our audit procedures included, among others, the performance of analytical procedures to develop
an independent range of the liability for retail incentives as of the balance sheet date. Our
independent range was developed for comparison to the Company’s recorded liability, and is based
on historical claims, forecasted spend, and the specific vehicle mix of current dealer stock. In
addition, we performed sensitivity analyses over the cost per unit assumption developed by
management to evaluate the impact on the liability resulting from a change in the assumption.
Lastly, we assessed management’s forecasting process by performing quarterly hindsight analyses
to assess the adequacy of prior forecasts.
Valuation of GM Financial Equipment on Operating Leases
Description of the matter GM Financial has recorded investments in vehicles leased to retail customers under operating
leases. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, at the beginning of the lease,
management establishes an expected residual value for each vehicle at the end of the lease term.
The Company’s estimated residual value of leased vehicles at the end of lease term was $29.2
billion as of December 31, 2020.
48
Table of Contents
Auditing management’s estimate of the residual value of leased vehicles involved a high degree of
judgment. Management’s estimate is based, in part, on third-party data which considers inputs
including recent auction values and significant assumptions regarding the expected future volume
of leased vehicles that will be returned to the Company, used car prices, manufacturer incentive
programs and fuel prices. Realization of the residual values is dependent on the future ability to
market the vehicles under future prevailing market conditions.
How we addressed the matter
in our auditWe evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the Company’s controls over the
lease residual estimation process, including controls over management’s review of residual value
estimates obtained from the Company’s third-party provider and other significant assumptions.
Our procedures also included, among others, independently recalculating depreciation related to
equipment on operating leases and performing sensitivity analyses related to significant
assumptions. We also performed hindsight analyses to assess the propriety of management’s
estimate of residual values, as well as tested the completeness and accuracy of data from
underlying systems and data warehouses that are used in the estimation models.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
 
To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of General Motors Company
Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited General Motors Company and subsidiaries’ internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020,
based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, General Motors Company and subsidiaries (the
Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on
the COSO criteria.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)
(PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements
of income, comprehensive income, cash flows and equity for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, and
the related notes and our report dated February 10, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment
of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal
Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with
respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities
and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects.
Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material
weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain
to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of
the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that
could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because
of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Note 1. Nature of Operations and Basis of Presentation
General Motors Company was incorporated as a Delaware corporation in 2009. We design, build and sell trucks, crossovers, cars
and automobile parts worldwide and are investing in and growing an autonomous vehicle business. We also provide automotive
financing services through GM Financial. We analyze the results of our continuing operations through the following segments:
GMNA, GMI, Cruise and GM Financial. Cruise is our global segment responsible for the development and commercialization of
autonomous vehicle technology. Nonsegment operations are classified as Corporate. Corporate includes certain centrally recorded
income and costs such as interest, income taxes, corporate expenditures and certain nonsegment-specific revenues and expenses.
The consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP. Except for per share amounts or as otherwise
specified, amounts presented within tables are stated in millions.
Principles of Consolidation We consolidate entities that we control due to ownership of a majority voting interest and we
consolidate variable interest entities (VIEs) when we are the primary beneficiary. All intercompany balances and transactions have
been eliminated in consolidation. Our share of earnings or losses of nonconsolidated affiliates is included in our consolidated
operating results using the equity method of accounting when we are able to exercise significant influence over the operating and
financial decisions of the affiliate.
Use of Estimates in the Preparation of the Financial Statements Accounting estimates are an integral part of the consolidated
financial statements. These estimates require the use of judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses in the periods presented. We believe that the accounting estimates employed are appropriate and the
resulting balances are reasonable; however, due to the inherent uncertainties in making estimates, actual results could differ from
the original estimates, requiring adjustments to these balances in future periods.
GM Financial The amounts presented for GM Financial have been adjusted to include the effect of our tax attributes on GM
Financial's deferred tax positions and provision for income taxes, which are not applicable to GM Financial on a stand-alone basis,
and to eliminate the effect of transactions between GM Financial and the other members of the consolidated group. Accordingly,
the amounts presented will differ from those presented by GM Financial on a stand-alone basis.
Note 2. Significant Accounting Policies
The accounting policies that follow are utilized by our automotive, automotive financing and Cruise operations, unless otherwise
indicated. We adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-13 "Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326):
Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments" (ASU 2016-13) on January 1, 2020 on a modified retrospective basis. As
such, the comparative information in prior periods was not restated and continues to be reported under the accounting standards in
effect for those periods. The accounting policies that follow for Marketable Debt Securities, Accounts and Notes Receivable and
GM Financial Receivables that were affected by the adoption of ASU 2016-13 became effective on January 1, 2020.
Revenue Recognition
Automotive Automotive net sales and revenue represents the amount of consideration to which we expect to be entitled in
exchange for vehicle, parts and accessories and services and other sales. The consideration recognized represents the amount
received, typically shortly after the sale to a customer, net of estimated dealer and customer sales incentives we reasonably expect
to pay. Significant factors in determining our estimates of incentives include forecasted sales volume, product mix and the rate of
customer acceptance of incentive programs, all of which are estimated based on historical experience and assumptions concerning
future customer behavior and market conditions. Subsequent adjustments to incentive estimates are possible as facts and
circumstances change over time. A portion of the consideration received is deferred for separate performance obligations, such as
maintenance and vehicle connectivity, that will be provided to our customers at a future date. Taxes assessed by various
government entities, such as sales, use and value-added taxes, collected at the time of the vehicle sale are excluded from
Automotive net sales and revenue. Costs for shipping and handling activities that occur after control of the vehicle transfers to the
dealer are recognized at the time of sale and presented in Automotive and other cost of sales.
Vehicle, Parts and Accessories For the majority of vehicle and accessories sales, our customers obtain control and we recognize
revenue when the vehicle transfers to the dealer, which generally occurs when the vehicle is released to the carrier responsible for
transporting it to a dealer. Revenue, net of estimated returns, is recognized on the sale of parts upon delivery to
55

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)
the customer. When our customers have a right to return eligible parts and accessories, we consider the returns in our estimation of
the transaction price.
Transfers to daily rental companies are accounted for as sales, with revenue recognized at the time of transfer. We defer revenue
for remarketing obligations, record a residual value guarantee and reflect a liability for amounts expected to be paid once the
remarketing services are complete at the time of certain transfers and recognize deferred revenue in earnings upon completion of
the remarketing service. Transfers containing a substantive repurchase obligation are accounted for as operating leases and rental
income is recognized over the estimated term of the lease. Our total exposure to vehicle repurchase obligations is reduced to the
extent vehicles are able to be resold to a third party.
Used Vehicles Proceeds from the auction of vehicles returned from daily rental car companies and vehicles utilized by our
employees are recognized in Automotive net sales and revenue upon transfer of control of the vehicle to the customer and the
related vehicle carrying value is recognized in Automotive and other cost of sales.
Services and Other Services and other revenue primarily consists of revenue from vehicle-related service arrangements and after-
sale services such as maintenance, OnStar, vehicle connectivity and extended service warranties. For those service arrangements
that are bundled with a vehicle sale, a portion of the revenue from the sale is allocated to the service component and recognized as
deferred revenue within Accrued liabilities or Other liabilities. We recognize revenue for bundled services and services sold
separately as services are performed, typically over a period of up to seven years.
Automotive Financing - GM Financial Finance charge income earned on finance receivables is recognized using the effective
interest method. Fees and commissions received (including incentive payments) and direct costs of originating loans are deferred
and amortized over the term of the related finance receivables using the effective interest method and are removed from the
consolidated balance sheets when the related finance receivables are fully charged off or paid in full. Accrual of finance charge
income on retail finance receivables is generally suspended on accounts that are more than 60 days delinquent, accounts in
bankruptcy and accounts in repossession. Payments received on nonaccrual loans are first applied to any fees due, then to any
interest due and then any remaining amounts are applied to principal. Interest accrual generally resumes once an account has
received payments bringing the delinquency to less than 60 days past due. Accrual of finance charge income on commercial finance
receivables is generally suspended on accounts that are more than 90 days delinquent, upon receipt of a bankruptcy notice from a
borrower, or where reasonable doubt exists about the full collectability of contractually agreed upon principal and interest.
Payments received on nonaccrual loans are first applied to principal. Interest accrual resumes once an account has received
payments bringing the account fully current and collection of contractual principal and interest is reasonably assured (including
amounts previously charged off).
Income from operating lease assets, which includes lease origination fees, net of lease origination costs, is recorded as operating
lease revenue on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease agreement. Gains or losses realized upon disposition of off-lease
assets including any payments received from lessees upon lease termination, are included in GM Financial interest, operating and
other.
Advertising and Promotion Expenditures Advertising and promotion expenditures, which are expensed as incurred in
Automotive and other selling, general and administrative expense, were $2.7 billion, $3.7 billion and $4.0 billion in the years ended
December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.
Research and Development Expenditures Research and development expenditures, which are expensed as incurred in
Automotive and other cost of sales, were $6.2 billion, $6.8 billion and $7.8 billion in the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and
2018. We enter into cost sharing arrangements with third parties or nonconsolidated affiliates for product-related research,
engineering, design and development activities. Cost sharing payments and fees related to these arrangements are presented in
Automotive and other cost of sales.
Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash Cash equivalents are defined as short-term, highly-liquid investments with original
maturities of 90 days or less. Certain operating agreements require us to post cash as collateral. Cash and cash equivalents subject
to contractual restrictions and not readily available are classified as restricted cash. Restricted cash is invested in accordance with
the terms of the underlying agreements and include amounts related to various deposits, escrows and other cash collateral.
Restricted cash is included in Other current assets and Other assets in the consolidated balance sheets.

Fair Value Measurements A three-level valuation hierarchy, based upon observable and unobservable inputs, is used for fair value
measurements. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect market
assumptions based on the best evidence available. These two types of inputs create the following fair value hierarchy: Level 1 –
Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets; Level 2 – Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted
prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and model-derived valuations whose significant inputs are
observable; and Level 3 – Instruments whose significant inputs are unobservable.
Marketable Debt Securities We generally classify marketable debt securities as available-for-sale. Various factors, including
turnover of holdings and investment guidelines, are considered in determining the classification of securities. Available-for-sale
debt securities are recorded at fair value with non-credit related unrealized gains and losses recorded in Accumulated other
comprehensive loss until realized. Non-credit related unrealized losses are reclassified to Interest income and other non-operating
income, net if we intend to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before the
recovery of the unrealized loss. Credit losses are recorded in Interest income and other non-operating income, net. An evaluation is
made quarterly to determine if any portion of unrealized losses recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss needs to be
reclassified.
We determine realized gains and losses for all debt securities using the specific identification method and measure the fair value
of our marketable debt securities using a market approach where identical or comparable prices are available and an income
approach in other cases. If quoted market prices are not available, fair values of securities are determined using prices from a
pricing service, pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or discounted cash flow models. These prices
represent non-binding quotes. Our pricing service utilizes industry-standard pricing models that consider various inputs. We
conduct an annual review of our pricing service and believe the prices received from our pricing service are a reliable
representation of exit prices.
Accounts and Notes Receivable Accounts and notes receivable primarily consists of amounts that are due and payable from our
customers for the sale of vehicles, parts, and accessories. We evaluate the collectability of receivables each reporting period and
record an allowance for doubtful accounts to present the net amount expected to be collected on our receivables. Additions to the
allowance are charged to bad debt expense reported in Automotive and other selling, general and administrative expense and were
insignificant in the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.
GM Financial Receivables Finance receivables are carried at amortized cost, net of allowance for loan losses. Provisions for loan
losses are charged to operations in amounts sufficient to maintain the allowance for loan losses at levels considered adequate to
cover expected credit losses on the finance receivables. For retail finance receivables, GM Financial uses static pool modeling
techniques to determine the allowance for loan losses expected over the remaining life of the receivables, which is supplemented by
management judgment. The modeling techniques incorporate reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic conditions over the
expected remaining life of the finance receivables. The economic forecasts incorporate factors which vary by region that GM
Financial believes will have the largest impact on expected losses, including unemployment rates, interest rate spreads, disposable
personal income and growth rates in gross domestic product.
Troubled debt restructurings (TDRs) are grouped separately for purposes of measuring the allowance. The allowance for TDRs
uses static pool modeling techniques like non-TDR retail finance receivables to determine the expected loss amount. The expected
cash flows of the receivables are then discounted at the original weighted average effective interest rate of the pool. Factors
considered when estimating the allowance for TDRs are based on an evaluation of historical and current information, which may be
supplemented by management judgment. Finance charge income from loans classified as TDRs is accounted for in the same
manner as other accruing loans. Cash collections on these loans are allocated according to the same payment hierarchy
methodology applied to loans that are not classified as TDRs.
Commercial finance receivables are carried at amortized cost, net of allowance for loan losses and amounts held under a cash
management program. GM Financial establishes the allowance for loan losses based on historical loss experience, as well as the
forecast for industry vehicle sales, which is the economic indicator believed to have the largest impact on expected losses.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in
the ordinary course of business less cost to sell, and considers general market and economic conditions, periodic reviews of current
profitability of vehicles, product warranty costs and the effect of estimated sales incentives. Net realizable value for off-lease and
other vehicles is current auction sales proceeds less disposal and warranty costs. Productive material, supplies, work in process and
service parts are reviewed to determine if inventory quantities are in excess of forecasted usage or if they have become obsolete.

Equipment on Operating Leases Equipment on operating leases, net consists of vehicle leases to retail customers with lease terms
of two to five years and vehicle sales to rental car companies that are expected to be repurchased in an average of seven months.
We are exposed to changes in the residual values of these assets. The residual values represent estimates of the values of the leased
vehicles at the end of the lease agreements and are determined based on forecasted auction proceeds when there is a reliable basis
to make such a determination. Realization of the residual values is dependent on the future ability to market the vehicles under
prevailing market conditions. The estimate of the residual value is evaluated over the life of the arrangement and adjustments may
be made to the extent the expected value of the vehicle changes. Adjustments may be in the form of revisions to the depreciation
rate or recognition of an impairment charge. A lease vehicle asset group is determined to be impaired if an impairment indicator
exists and the expected future cash flows, which include estimated residual values, are lower than the carrying amount of the
vehicle asset group. If the carrying amount is considered impaired an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the
carrying amount exceeds fair value of the vehicle asset group. Fair value is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows,
including estimated residual values. In our automotive operations when a vehicle that is accounted for as a lease is returned the
asset is reclassified from Equipment on operating leases, net to Inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Upon
disposition, proceeds are recorded in Automotive net sales and revenue and costs are recorded in Automotive and other cost of
sales. In our automotive finance operations when a leased vehicle is returned or repossessed the asset is recorded in Other assets at
the lower of amortized cost or net realizable value. Upon disposition a gain or loss is recorded in GM Financial interest, operating
and other expenses for any difference between the net book value of the leased asset and the proceeds from the disposition of the
asset.
Equity Investments When events and circumstances warrant, equity investments accounted for under the equity method of
accounting are evaluated for impairment. An impairment charge is recorded whenever a decline in value of an equity investment
below its carrying amount is determined to be other-than-temporary. Impairment charges related to equity method investments are
recorded in Equity income. Equity investments that are not accounted for under the equity method of accounting are measured at
fair value with changes in fair value recorded in Interest income and other non-operating income, net.
Property, net Property, plant and equipment, including internal use software, is recorded at cost. Major improvements that extend
the useful life or add functionality are capitalized. The gross amount of assets under finance leases is included in property, plant and
equipment. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred. We depreciate depreciable property using
the straight-line method. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the period of lease or the life of the asset, whichever is
shorter. The amortization of the assets under finance leases is included in depreciation expense. Upon retirement or disposition of
property, plant and equipment, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated and any resulting gain or loss is
recorded in earnings. Impairment charges related to property are recorded in Automotive and other cost of sales, Automotive and
other selling, general and administrative expense or GM Financial interest, operating and other expenses.
Special Tools Special tools represent product-specific propulsion and non-propulsion related tools, dies, molds and other items
used in the vehicle manufacturing process. Expenditures for special tools are recorded at cost and are capitalized. We amortize
special tools over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method or an accelerated amortization method based on their
historical and estimated production volume. Impairment charges related to special tools are recorded in Automotive and other cost
of sales.
Goodwill Goodwill is not amortized but rather tested for impairment annually on October 1 and when events warrant such a
review. The impairment test entails an assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that an
impairment exists. If it is more likely than not that an impairment exists, then a quantitative impairment test is performed.
Impairment exists when the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value.
Intangible Assets, net Intangible assets, excluding goodwill, primarily include brand names, technology and intellectual property,
customer relationships and dealer networks. Intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line or an accelerated method of
amortization over their estimated useful lives. An accelerated amortization method reflecting the pattern in which the asset will be
consumed is utilized if that pattern can be reliably determined. We consider the period of expected cash flows and underlying data
used to measure the fair value of the intangible assets when selecting a useful life. Amortization of developed technology and
intellectual property is recorded in Automotive and other cost of sales. Amortization of brand names, customer relationships and
our dealer networks is recorded in Automotive and other selling, general and administrative expense or GM Financial interest,
operating and other expenses. Impairment charges, if any, related to intangible assets are recorded in Automotive and other selling,
general and administrative expense or Automotive and other cost of sales.

Valuation of Long-Lived Assets The carrying amount of long-lived assets and finite-lived intangible assets to be held and used in
the business is evaluated for impairment when events and circumstances warrant. If the carrying amount of a long-lived asset group
is considered impaired, a loss is recorded based on the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds fair value. Product-specific
long-lived asset groups and non-product specific long-lived assets are separately tested for impairment on an asset group basis. Fair
value is determined using either the market or sales comparison approach, cost approach or anticipated cash flows discounted at a
rate commensurate with the risk involved. Long-lived assets to be disposed of other than by sale are considered held for use until
disposition.
Pension and OPEB Plans
Attribution, Methods and Assumptions The cost of benefits provided by defined benefit pension plans is recorded in the period
employees provide service. The cost of pension plan amendments that provide for benefits already earned by plan participants is
amortized over the expected period of benefit which may be the duration of the applicable collective bargaining agreement specific
to the plan, the expected future working lifetime or the life expectancy of the plan participants.
The cost of medical, dental, legal service and life insurance benefits provided through postretirement benefit plans is recorded in
the period employees provide service. The cost of postretirement plan amendments that provide for benefits already earned by plan
participants is amortized over the expected period of benefit which may be the average period to full eligibility or the average life
expectancy of the plan participants.
An expected return on plan asset methodology is utilized to calculate future pension expense for certain significant funded
benefit plans. A market-related value of plan assets methodology is also utilized that averages gains and losses on the plan assets
over a period of years to determine future pension expense. The methodology recognizes 60% of the difference between the fair
value of assets and the expected calculated value in the first year and 10% of that difference over each of the next four years.
The discount rate assumption is established for each of the retirement-related benefit plans at their respective measurement dates.
In the U.S. we use a cash flow matching approach that uses projected cash flows matched to spot rates along a high-quality
corporate bond yield curve to determine the present value of cash flows to calculate a single equivalent discount rate. We apply
individual annual yield curve rates to determine the service cost and interest cost for our pension and OPEB plans to more
specifically link the cash flows related to service cost and interest cost to bonds maturing in their year of payment.
The benefit obligation for pension plans in Canada, the U.K. and Germany represents 93% of the non-U.S. pension benefit
obligation at December 31, 2020. The discount rates for plans in Canada, the U.K. and Germany are determined using a cash flow
matching approach like the U.S.
Plan Asset Valuation Due to the lack of timely available market information for certain investments in the asset classes described
below as well as the inherent uncertainty of valuation, reported fair values may differ from fair values that would have been used
had timely available market information been available.
Common and Preferred Stock Common and preferred stock for which market prices are readily available at the measurement date
are valued at the last reported sale price or official closing price on the primary market or exchange on which they are actively
traded and are classified in Level 1. Such equity securities for which the market is not considered to be active are valued via the use
of observable inputs, which may include the use of adjusted market prices last available, bids or last available sales prices and/or
other observable inputs and are classified in Level 2. Common and preferred stock classified in Level 3 are privately issued
securities or other issues that are valued via the use of valuation models using significant unobservable inputs that generally
consider aged (stale) pricing, earnings multiples, discounted cash flows and/or other qualitative and quantitative factors.
Debt Securities Valuations for debt securities are based on quotations received from independent pricing services or from dealers
who make markets in such securities. Debt securities priced via pricing services that utilize matrix pricing which considers readily
observable inputs such as the yield or price of bonds of comparable quality, coupon, maturity and type as well as dealer supplied
prices, are classified in Level 2. Debt securities that are typically priced by dealers and pricing services via the use of proprietary
pricing models which incorporate significant unobservable inputs are classified in Level 3. These inputs
59

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)
primarily consist of yield and credit spread assumptions, discount rates, prepayment curves, default assumptions and recovery rates.
Investment Funds, Private Equity and Debt Investments and Real Estate Investments Investment funds, private equity and debt
investments and real estate investments are valued based on the Net Asset Value (NAV) per Share (or its equivalent) as a practical
expedient to estimate fair value due to the absence of readily available market prices.
NAV's are provided by the respective investment sponsors or investment advisers and are subsequently reviewed and approved
by management. In the event management concludes a reported NAV does not reflect fair value or is not determined as of the
financial reporting measurement date, we will consider whether and when deemed necessary to make an adjustment at the balance
sheet date. In determining whether an adjustment to the external valuation is required, we will review material factors that could
affect the valuation, such as changes in the composition or performance of the underlying investments or comparable investments,
overall market conditions, expected sale prices for private investments which are probable of being sold in the short-term and other
economic factors that may possibly have a favorable or unfavorable effect on the reported external valuation.
Stock Incentive Plans Our stock incentive plans include RSUs, Restricted Stock Awards (RSAs), PSUs, stock options and awards
that may be settled in our stock, the stock of our subsidiaries or in cash. We measure and record compensation expense based on the
fair value of GM or Cruise's common stock on the date of grant for RSUs, RSAs and PSUs and the grant date fair value,
determined utilizing a lattice model or the Black-Scholes formula, for stock options and PSUs. We record compensation cost for
service-based RSUs, RSAs, PSUs and service-based stock options on a straight-line basis over the entire vesting period, or for
retirement eligible employees over the requisite service period. RSUs granted in stock of Cruise vest upon satisfaction of both a
service condition and a liquidity condition, defined as a change in control transaction or the consummation of an initial public
offering. Compensation costs for RSUs granted in stock of Cruise will be recorded when the liquidity condition is met.
Compensation cost for awards that do not have an established accounting grant date, but for which the service inception date has
been established, or are settled in cash is based on the fair value of GM or Cruise's common stock at the end of each reporting
period. We use the graded vesting method to record compensation cost for stock options with market conditions over the lesser of
the vesting period or the time period an employee becomes eligible to retain the award at retirement.
Product Warranty and Recall Campaigns The estimated costs related to product warranties are accrued at the time products are
sold and are charged to Automotive and other cost of sales. These estimates are established using historical information on the
nature, frequency and average cost of claims of each vehicle line or each model year of the vehicle line and assumptions about
future activity and events. Revisions are made when necessary and are based on changes in these factors.
The estimated costs related to recall campaigns are accrued when probable and estimable, which is generally at the time of
vehicle sale. In GMNA, we estimate the costs related to recall campaigns by applying a paid loss approach that considers the
number of historical recall campaigns and the estimated cost for each recall campaign. The estimated costs associated with recall
campaigns in other geographical regions are determined using the estimated costs of repairs and the estimated number of vehicles
to be repaired. Costs associated with recall campaigns are charged to Automotive and other cost of sales. Revisions are made when
necessary based on changes in these factors.
Income Taxes The liability method is used in accounting for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for
temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the consolidated financial
statements using the statutory tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect on deferred
tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax laws or rates is recorded in the results of operations in the period that includes the
enactment date under the law.
We establish valuation allowances for deferred tax assets based on a more likely than not standard. Deferred income tax assets
are evaluated quarterly to determine if valuation allowances are required or should be adjusted. The ability to realize deferred tax
assets depends on the ability to generate sufficient taxable income within the carryback or carryforward periods provided for in the
tax law for each applicable tax jurisdiction. The assessment regarding whether a valuation allowance is required or should be
adjusted also considers all available positive and negative evidence factors. It is difficult to conclude a valuation allowance is not
required when there is significant objective and verifiable negative evidence, such as cumulative losses in recent years. We utilize a
rolling three years of actual and current year results as the primary measure of cumulative losses in recent years.

Income tax expense (benefit) for the year is allocated between continuing operations and other categories of income such as
Other comprehensive income (loss). In periods in which there is a pre-tax loss from continuing operations and pre-tax income in
another income category, the tax benefit allocated to continuing operations is determined by taking into account the pre-tax income
of other categories. We record Global Intangible Low Tax Income (GILTI) as a current period expense when incurred.
We record uncertain tax positions on the basis of a two-step process whereby we determine whether it is more likely than not that
the tax positions will be sustained based on the technical merits of the position, and for those tax positions that meet the more likely
than not criteria, we recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate
settlement with the related tax authority. We record interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions in Income tax expense
(benefit).
Foreign Currency Transactions and Translation The assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries that use the local currency as
their functional currency are translated to U.S. Dollars based on the current exchange rate prevailing at each balance sheet date and
any resulting translation adjustments are included in Accumulated other comprehensive loss. The assets and liabilities of foreign
subsidiaries whose local currency is not their functional currency are remeasured from their local currency to their functional
currency and then translated to U.S. Dollars. Revenues and expenses are translated into U.S. Dollars using the average exchange
rates prevailing for each period presented. The financial statements of any foreign subsidiary that has been identified as having a
highly inflationary economy are remeasured as if the functional currency were the U.S. Dollar.
Gains and losses arising from foreign currency transactions and the effects of remeasurements discussed in the preceding
paragraph are recorded in Automotive and other cost of sales and GM Financial interest, operating and other expenses unless
related to Automotive debt, which are recorded in Interest income and other non-operating income, net. Foreign currency
transaction and remeasurement losses were $203 million, gains of $85 million and losses of $168 million in the years ended
December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.
Derivative Financial Instruments Derivative financial instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities at fair value. The
accounting for changes in the fair value of each derivative financial instrument depends on whether it has been designated and
qualifies as an accounting hedge, as well as the type of hedging relationship identified. Derivative instruments are not used for
trading or speculative purposes.
Automotive We utilize options, swaps and forward contracts to manage foreign currency and commodity price risk. The change
in fair value of option and forward contracts not designated as hedges is recorded in Interest income and other non-operating
income, net. Cash flows for all derivative financial instruments are classified in cash flows from operating activities.
We estimate the fair value of the PSA warrants using a Black-Scholes formula. The significant inputs to the model include the
PSA stock price and the estimated dividend yield. We are entitled to receive any dividends declared by PSA through the conversion
date upon exercise of the warrants. Gains or losses as a result of the change in the fair value of the PSA warrants are recorded in
Interest income and other non-operating income, net.
Automotive Financing - GM Financial GM Financial utilizes interest rate derivative instruments to manage interest rate risk and
foreign currency derivative instruments to manage foreign currency risk. The change in fair value of the derivative instruments not
designated as hedges is recorded in GM Financial interest, operating and other expenses. Cash flows for all derivative financial
instruments are classified in cash flows from operating activities.
Certain interest rate and foreign currency swap agreements have been designated as fair value hedges. The risk being hedged is
the risk of changes in the fair value of the hedged debt attributable to changes in the benchmark interest rate or the risk of changes
in fair value attributable to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. If the swap has been designated as a fair value hedge, the
changes in the fair value of the hedged item are recorded in GM Financial interest, operating and other expenses. The change in fair
value of the related hedge is also recorded in GM Financial interest, operating and other expenses.
Certain interest rate swap and foreign currency swap agreements have been designated as cash flow hedges. The risk being
hedged is the interest rate and foreign currency risk related to forecasted transactions. If the contract has been designated as a cash
flow hedge, the change in the fair value of the cash flow hedge is deferred in Accumulated other comprehensive loss and is
recognized in GM Financial interest, operating and other expenses along with the earnings effect of the hedged item when the
hedged item affects earnings. Changes in the fair value of amounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recorded
currently in earnings and are presented in the same income statement line as the earnings effect of the hedged item.

Recently Adopted Accounting Standards Effective January 1, 2020, we adopted ASU 2016-13, which requires entities to use a
new impairment model based on current expected credit losses (CECL) rather than incurred losses. Estimated credit losses under
CECL consider relevant information about past events, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the
collectability of financial assets, resulting in recognition of lifetime expected credit losses at initial recognition of the related asset.
We adopted ASU 2016-13 on a modified retrospective basis by recognizing an after-tax cumulative-effect adjustment to the
opening balance of Retained earnings of $660 million, inclusive of $643 million related to GM Financial. The application of ASU
2016-13 increased our allowance for loan losses related to GM Financial receivables, net by $801 million and had an insignificant
impact to our allowance for credit losses for Accounts and notes receivable and no adoption impact to Marketable debt securities on
our consolidated balance sheets.
Effective July 1, 2020, we adopted ASU 2020-04, “Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference
Rate Reform on Financial Reporting” (ASU 2020-04), which provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying U.S. GAAP
if certain criteria are met to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions that reference LIBOR or another reference rate
expected to be discontinued, on a prospective basis. We do not believe the discontinuance of LIBOR will be a significant event for
our Automotive arrangements. A substantial portion of GM Financial’s indebtedness bears interest at variable interest rates,
primarily based on USD-LIBOR. The adoption of, and future elections under, ASU 2020-04 are not expected to have a material
impact on our consolidated financial statements as the standard will ease, if warranted, the requirements for accounting for the
future effects of the rate reform. We continue to monitor the impact the discontinuance of LIBOR or another reference rate will
have on GM Financial's contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions.

GM Financial reviews the ongoing credit quality of retail finance receivables based on customer payment activity. A retail
account is considered delinquent if a substantial portion of a scheduled payment has not been received by the date the payment was
contractually due. Retail finance receivables are collateralized by vehicle titles and, subject to local laws, GM Financial generally
has the right to repossess the vehicle in the event the customer defaults on the payment terms of the contract. The accrual of finance
charge income had been suspended on delinquent retail finance receivables with contractual amounts due of $714 million and $875
million at December 31, 2020 and 2019. The following table is a consolidated summary of the delinquency status of the
outstanding amortized cost of retail finance receivables for each vintage of the portfolio at December 31, 2020:

(a) Represents the contractual amounts of delinquent retail finance receivables, which is not significantly different than the outstanding
amortized cost for such receivables.
The outstanding amortized cost of retail finance receivables that are considered TDRs was $2.2 billion at December 31, 2020,
including $301 million in nonaccrual loans.
Commercial Finance Receivables GM Financial's commercial finance receivables consist of dealer financings, primarily for
inventory purchases. Proprietary models are used to assign a risk rating to each dealer. GM Financial performs periodic credit
reviews of each dealership and adjusts the dealership's risk rating, if necessary. The commercial finance receivables on nonaccrual
status were insignificant at December 31, 2020.
Prior to January 1, 2020, GM Financial estimated the allowance for loan losses based on an analysis of the experience of
comparable commercial lenders. Effective January 1, 2020, GM Financial establishes the allowance for loan losses based on
historical loss experience for the consolidated portfolio, in addition to forecast for industry vehicle sales. The updated risk rating
categories are as follows:
Rating Description
IPerforming accounts with strong to acceptable financial metrics with at least satisfactory capacity to meet financial
commitments.
IIPerforming accounts experiencing potential weakness in financial metrics and repayment prospects resulting in
increased monitoring.
IIINon-Performing accounts with inadequate paying capacity for current obligations and have the distinct possibility of
creating a loss if deficiencies are not corrected.
IVNon-Performing accounts with inadequate paying capacity for current obligations and inherent weaknesses that make
collection of liquidation in full highly questionable or improbable.

Note 10. Goodwill and Intangible Assets
Goodwill of $1.9 billion consisted of $1.3 billion and $1.4 billion recorded in GM Financial, primarily related to its North
America reporting unit, and $567 million and $504 million included in Cruise at December 31, 2020 and 2019. The COVID-19
pandemic has caused material disruption to businesses, resulting in an economic slowdown. The economic and social uncertainty
resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic indicated that it was more likely than not that a goodwill impairment existed at March 31,
2020 for GM Financial's North America reporting unit. Therefore, at March 31, 2020, we performed an event-driven goodwill
impairment test for GM Financial's North America reporting unit and determined no goodwill impairment existed.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)
The fair value of GM Financial's North America reporting unit at March 31, 2020 was determined based on valuation techniques
using the best available information, primarily discounted cash flow projections. We make significant assumptions and estimates
about the extent and timing of future cash flows. There can be no assurance that anticipated financial results will be achieved.
Under multiple scenarios, including fully weighting the downside cash flow scenario, the estimated fair value of GM Financial's
North America reporting unit at March 31, 2020 exceeded its carrying amount. Since our goodwill impairment analysis at March
31, 2020, we performed a qualitative assessment of goodwill impairment by evaluating our economic performance, outlook and
other events and circumstances and noted no indicators that would warrant further quantitative testing of goodwill impairment.

Note 11. Variable Interest Entities
Consolidated VIEs
Automotive Financing - GM Financial
GM Financial uses special purpose entities (SPEs) that are considered VIEs to issue variable funding notes to third party bank-
sponsored warehouse facilities or asset-backed securities to investors in securitization transactions. The debt issued by these VIEs
is backed by finance receivables and leasing-related assets transferred to the VIEs (Securitized Assets). GM Financial determined
that it is the primary beneficiary of the SPEs because the servicing responsibilities for the Securitized Assets give GM Financial the
power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the performance of the VIEs and the variable interests in the VIEs give
GM Financial the obligation to absorb losses and the right to receive residual returns that could potentially be significant. The
assets of the VIEs serve as the sole source of repayment for the debt issued by these entities. Investors in the notes issued by the
VIEs do not have recourse to GM Financial or its other assets, with the exception of customary representation and warranty
repurchase provisions and indemnities that GM Financial provides as the servicer. GM Financial is not required to provide
additional financial support to these SPEs. While these subsidiaries are included in GM Financial's consolidated financial
statements, they are separate legal entities and their assets are legally owned by them and are not available to GM Financial's
creditors.
The following table summarizes the assets and liabilities related to GM Financial's consolidated VIEs:
December 31, 2020 December 31, 2019
Restricted cash – current $ 2,190 $ 2,202 
Restricted cash – non-current $ 449 $ 441 
GM Financial receivables, net of fees – current $ 17,211 $ 19,081 
GM Financial receivables, net of fees – non-current $ 15,107 $ 15,921 
GM Financial equipment on operating leases, net $ 16,322 $ 14,464 
GM Financial short-term debt and current portion of long-term debt $ 20,450 $ 23,952 
GM Financial long-term debt $ 18,974 $ 15,819 
GM Financial recognizes finance charge, leased vehicle and fee income on the Securitized Assets and interest expense on the
secured debt issued in a securitization transaction and records a provision for loan losses to recognize loan losses expected over the
remaining life of the finance receivables.

Nonconsolidated VIEs
Automotive
Nonconsolidated VIEs principally include automotive related operating entities to which we provided financial support to ensure
that our supply needs for production are met or are not disrupted. Our variable interests in these nonconsolidated VIEs include
equity investments, accounts and loans receivable, committed financial support and other off-balance sheet arrangements. The
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities related to our nonconsolidated VIEs were insignificant at December 31, 2020 and 2019.
Our maximum exposure to loss as a result of our involvement with these VIEs was $1.2 billion, inclusive of $776 million in
committed capital contributions to Ultium Cells LLC at December 31, 2020, and an insignificant amount at December 31, 2019.
We currently lack the power through voting or similar rights to direct the activities of these entities that most significantly affect
their economic performance.

(b) Excludes our 364-day, $2.0 billion facility designated for exclusive use by GM Financial.
(c) Includes coupon rates on debt denominated in various foreign currencies and interest free loans.
Unsecured debt primarily consists of revolving credit facilities and senior notes. In March 2020, we borrowed: (1) $3.4 billion
against our three-year, $4.0 billion facility; (2) $2.0 billion against our three-year, $3.0 billion facility, which reduced to $2.0 billion
in May 2020 (three-year, $2.0 billion transformation facility); and (3) $10.5 billion against our five-year, $10.5 billion facility with
maturity dates ranging from 2021 to 2023. We repaid all amounts drawn under the revolving credit facilities as of December 31,
2020. We did not have any borrowings against our revolving credit facilities at December 31, 2019.
In April 2020, we renewed our 364-day, $2.0 billion facility dedicated for exclusive use by GM Financial for an additional 364-
day term and extended $3.6 billion of the three-year, $4.0 billion facility for an additional year expiring in April 2022. The
remaining portion will expire in April 2021, unless extended. As part of the extension of the three-year, $4.0 billion facility, we
agreed not to execute any share repurchases while we have any outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facilities, except
for the three-year, $2.0 billion transformation facility. In addition, we are restricted from paying dividends on our common shares if
outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facilities exceed $5.0 billion, with the exception of the three-year, $2.0 billion
transformation facility.
In May 2020, we issued $4.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes with a weighted average interest
rate of 6.11% and maturity dates ranging from 2023 to 2027. The notes are governed by a sixth supplemental indenture and the
same base indenture that governs our existing notes, which contains terms and covenants customary to these types of securities,
including a limitation on the amount of certain secured debt we may incur. The net proceeds from the issuance of these senior
unsecured notes provide additional financial flexibility and will be used for general corporate purposes. In May 2020, we entered
into a new unsecured 364-day, $2.0 billion revolving credit facility as an additional source of available liquidity. In August 2020,
we repaid $500 million of our floating rate senior unsecured debt upon maturity.

Secured debt consists of revolving credit facilities and securitization notes payable. Most of the secured debt was issued by VIEs
and is repayable only from proceeds related to the underlying pledged assets. Refer to Note 11 for additional information on GM
Financial's involvement with VIEs. GM Financial is required to hold certain funds in restricted cash accounts to provide additional
collateral for borrowings under certain secured credit facilities. The weighted-average interest rate on secured debt was 1.89% at
December 31, 2020. The revolving credit facilities have maturity dates ranging from 2021 to 2026 and securitization notes payable
have maturity dates ranging from 2021 to 2028. At the end of the revolving period, if not renewed, the debt of revolving credit
facilities will amortize over a defined period. In the year ended December 31, 2020, GM Financial renewed revolving credit
facilities with total borrowing capacity of $21.1 billion and issued $24.6 billion in aggregate principal amount of securitization
notes payable with an initial weighted average interest rate of 1.17% and maturity dates ranging from 2021 to 2028.
Unsecured debt consists of senior notes, credit facilities and other unsecured debt. Senior notes outstanding at December 31,
2020 have maturity dates ranging from 2021 to 2030 and have a weighted-average interest rate of 3.25%. In the year ended
December 31, 2020, GM Financial issued $9.2 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior notes with an initial weighted

Compliance with Debt Covenants Several of our loan facilities, including our revolving credit facilities, require compliance with
certain financial and operational covenants as well as regular reporting to lenders, including providing certain subsidiary financial
statements. Certain of GM Financial’s secured debt agreements also contain various covenants, including maintaining portfolio
performance ratios as well as limits on deferment levels. GM Financial’s unsecured debt obligations contain covenants including
limitations on GM Financial's ability to incur certain liens. Failure to meet certain of these requirements may result in a covenant
violation or an event of default depending on the terms of the agreement. An event of default may allow lenders to declare amounts
outstanding under these agreements immediately due and payable, to enforce their interests against collateral pledged under these
agreements or restrict our ability or GM Financial's ability to obtain additional borrowings. No technical defaults or covenant
violations existed at December 31, 2020.

Note 15. Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits
Employee Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans
Defined Benefit Pension Plans Defined benefit pension plans covering eligible U.S. hourly employees (hired prior to October
2007) and Canadian hourly employees (hired prior to October 2016) generally provide benefits of negotiated, stated amounts for
each year of service and supplemental benefits for employees who retire with 30 years of service before normal retirement age. The
benefits provided by the defined benefit pension plans covering eligible U.S. (hired prior to January 1, 2001) and Canadian salaried
employees and employees in certain other non-U.S. locations are generally based on years of service and compensation history.
Accrual of defined pension benefits ceased in 2012 for U.S. and Canadian salaried employees. There is also an unfunded
nonqualified pension plan primarily covering U.S. executives for service prior to January 1, 2007 and it is based on an “excess
plan” for service after that date.

Table of Contents
GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)
The funding policy for qualified defined benefit pension plans is to contribute annually not less than the minimum required by
applicable laws and regulations or to directly pay benefit payments where appropriate. In the year ended December 31, 2020 all
legal funding requirements were met. The following table summarizes contributions made to the defined benefit pension plans:
Years Ended December 31,
2020 2019 2018
U.S. hourly and salaried $ 68 $ 83 $ 76 
Non-U.S. 396 532 1,624 
Total $ 464 $ 615 $ 1,700 
We expect to contribute approximately $70 million to our U.S. non-qualified plans and approximately $500 million to our non-
U.S. pension plans in 2021.
Based on our current assumptions, over the next five years we expect no significant mandatory contributions to our U.S.
qualified pension plans and mandatory contributions totaling $366 million to our U.K. and Canada pension plans.
Other Postretirement Benefit Plans Certain hourly and salaried defined benefit plans provide postretirement medical, dental,
legal service and life insurance to eligible U.S. and Canadian retirees and their eligible dependents. Certain other non-U.S.
subsidiaries have postretirement benefit plans, although most non-U.S. employees are covered by government sponsored or
administered programs. We made contributions to the U.S. OPEB plans of $343 million, $326 million and $325 million in the years
ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. Plan participants' contributions were insignificant in the years ended December 31,
2020, 2019 and 2018.
Defined Contribution Plans We have defined contribution plans for eligible U.S. salaried and hourly employees that provide
discretionary matching contributions. Contributions are also made to certain non-U.S. defined contribution plans. We made
contributions to our defined contribution plans of $573 million, $537 million and $617 million in the years ended December 31,
2020, 2019 and 2018.
Significant Plan Amendments, Benefit Modifications and Related Events
Other Remeasurements The SOA issued mortality improvement tables in the three months ended December 31, 2020. We
incorporated these SOA mortality improvement tables into the December 31, 2020 measurement of our U.S. pension and OPEB
plans' benefit obligations. The change in these assumptions decreased the December 31, 2020 U.S. pension and OPEB plans'
obligations by $686 million. We incorporated the mortality improvement tables issued by the SOA in the three months ended
December 31, 2018, and updated our base mortality assumptions in the U.S. This change in assumption decreased the December
31, 2018 U.S. pension and OPEB plans' obligations by $264 million.

Assumptions
Investment Strategies and Long-Term Rate of Return Detailed periodic studies are conducted by our internal asset management
group as well as outside actuaries and are used to determine the long-term strategic mix among asset classes, risk mitigation
strategies and the expected long-term return on asset assumptions for the U.S. pension plans. The U.S. study includes a review of
alternative asset allocation and risk mitigation strategies, anticipated future long-term performance and risk of the individual asset
classes that comprise the plans' asset mix. Similar studies are performed for the significant non-U.S. pension plans with the
assistance of outside actuaries and asset managers. While the studies incorporate data from recent plan performance and historical
returns, the expected rate of return on plan assets represents our estimate of long-term prospective rates of return.
We continue to pursue various options to fund and de-risk our pension plans, including continued changes to the pension asset
portfolio mix to reduce funded status volatility. The strategic asset mix and risk mitigation strategies for the plans are tailored
specifically for each plan. Individual plans have distinct liabilities, liquidity needs and regulatory requirements. Consequently there
are different investment policies set by individual plan fiduciaries. Although investment policies and risk mitigation strategies may
differ among plans, each investment strategy is considered to be appropriate in the context of the specific factors affecting each
plan.
In setting new strategic asset mixes, consideration is given to the likelihood that the selected asset mixes will effectively fund the
projected pension plan liabilities, while aligning with the risk tolerance of the plans' fiduciaries. The strategic asset mixes for U.S.
defined benefit pension plans are increasingly designed to satisfy the competing objectives of improving funded positions (market
value of assets equal to or greater than the present value of the liabilities) and mitigating the possibility of a deterioration in funded
status.
Derivatives may be used to provide cost effective solutions for rebalancing investment portfolios, increasing or decreasing
exposure to various asset classes and for mitigating risks, primarily interest rate, equity and currency risks. Equity and fixed income
managers are permitted to utilize derivatives as efficient substitutes for traditional securities. Interest rate derivatives may be used
to adjust portfolio duration to align with a plan's targeted investment policy and equity derivatives may be used to protect equity
positions from downside market losses. Alternative investment managers are permitted to employ leverage, including through the
use of derivatives, which may alter economic exposure.
In December 2020, an investment policy study was completed for the U.S. pension plans. As a result of changes to our capital
market assumptions, the weighted-average long-term rate of return on assets decreased from 5.9% at December 31, 2019 to 5.6% at
December 31, 2020. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets used in determining pension expense for non-U.S. plans is
determined in a similar manner to the U.S. plans.
Target Allocation Percentages The following table summarizes the target allocations by asset category for U.S. and non-U.S.

Investment Fund Strategies Investment funds include hedge funds, funds of hedge funds, equity funds and fixed income funds.
Hedge funds and funds of hedge funds managers typically seek to achieve their objectives by allocating capital across a broad array
of funds and/or investment managers. Equity funds invest in U.S. common and preferred stocks as well as similar equity securities
issued by companies incorporated, listed or domiciled in developed and/or emerging market countries. Fixed income funds include
investments in high quality funds and, to a lesser extent, high yield funds. High quality fixed income funds invest in government
securities, investment-grade corporate bonds and mortgage and asset-backed securities. High yield fixed income funds invest in
high yield fixed income securities issued by corporations which are rated below investment grade. Other investment funds also
included in this category primarily represent multi-strategy funds that invest in broadly diversified portfolios of equity, fixed
income and derivative instruments.

GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)
Private equity and debt investments primarily consist of investments in private equity and debt funds. These investments provide
exposure to and benefit from long-term equity investments in private companies, including leveraged buy-outs, venture capital and
distressed debt strategies.
Real estate investments include funds that invest in entities which are primarily engaged in the ownership, acquisition,
development, financing, sale and/or management of income-producing real estate properties, both commercial and residential.
These funds typically seek long-term growth of capital and current income that is above average relative to public equity funds.
Significant Concentrations of Risk The assets of the pension plans include certain investment funds, private equity and debt
investments and real estate investments. Investment managers may be unable to quickly sell or redeem some or all of these
investments at an amount close or equal to fair value in order to meet a plan's liquidity requirements or to respond to specific events
such as deterioration in the creditworthiness of any particular issuer or counterparty.
Illiquid investments held by the plans are generally long-term investments that complement the long-term nature of pension
obligations and are not used to fund benefit payments when currently due. Plan management monitors liquidity risk on an ongoing
basis and has procedures in place that are designed to maintain flexibility in addressing plan-specific, broader industry and market
liquidity events.
The pension plans may invest in financial instruments denominated in foreign currencies and may be exposed to risks that the
foreign currency exchange rates might change in a manner that has an adverse effect on the value of the foreign currency
denominated assets or liabilities. Forward currency contracts may be used to manage and mitigate foreign currency risk.
The pension plans may invest in debt securities for which any change in the relevant interest rates for particular securities might
result in an investment manager being unable to secure similar returns upon the maturity or the sale of securities. In addition,
changes to prevailing interest rates or changes in expectations of future interest rates might result in an increase or decrease in the
fair value of the securities held. Interest rate swaps and other financial derivative instruments may be used to manage interest rate
risk.
Benefit Payments Benefits for most U.S. pension plans and certain non-U.S. pension plans are paid out of plan assets rather than
our Cash and cash equivalents. The following table summarizes net benefit payments expected to be paid in the future, which
include assumptions related to estimated future employee service:

Note 16. Commitments and Contingencies
Litigation-Related Liability and Tax Administrative Matters In the normal course of our business, we are named from time to
time as a defendant in various legal actions, including arbitrations, class actions and other litigation. We identify below the material
individual proceedings and investigations where we believe a material loss is reasonably possible or probable. We accrue for
matters when we believe that losses are probable and can be reasonably estimated. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had
accruals of $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion in Accrued liabilities and Other liabilities. In many matters, it is inherently difficult to
determine whether loss is probable or reasonably possible or to estimate the size or range of the possible loss. Accordingly adverse
outcomes from such proceedings could exceed the amounts accrued by an amount that could be material to our results of operations
or cash flows in any particular reporting period.
Proceedings Related to Ignition Switch Recall and Other Recalls In 2014 we announced various recalls relating to safety and
other matters. Those recalls included recalls to repair ignition switches that could under certain circumstances

unintentionally move from the “run” position to the “accessory” or “off” position with a corresponding loss of power, which could
in turn prevent airbags from deploying in the event of a crash.
Appellate Litigation Regarding Successor Liability Ignition Switch Claims In 2016, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second
Circuit held that the 2009 order of the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (Bankruptcy Court)
approving the sale of substantially all of the assets of Motors Liquidation Company (MLC) to GM free and clear of, among other
things, claims asserting successor liability for obligations owed by MLC could not be enforced to bar claims against GM asserted
by either plaintiffs who purchased used vehicles after the sale or against purchasers who asserted claims relating to the ignition
switch defect, including pre-sale personal injury claims and economic-loss claims.
Economic-Loss Claims We are aware of over 100 putative class actions that were filed against GM in U.S. and Canadian courts
alleging that consumers who purchased or leased vehicles manufactured by GM or MLC had been economically harmed by one or
more of the 2014 recalls and/or the underlying vehicle conditions associated with those recalls (economic-loss cases). In general,
these economic-loss cases seek recovery for purported compensatory damages, such as alleged benefit-of-the-bargain damages or
damages related to alleged diminution in value of the vehicles, as well as punitive damages, injunctive relief and other relief.
Many of the pending U.S. economic-loss claims have been transferred to, and consolidated in, a single federal court, the U.S.
District Court for the Southern District of New York (Southern District). These plaintiffs have asserted economic-loss claims under
federal and state laws, including claims relating to recalled vehicles manufactured by GM and claims asserting successor liability
relating to certain recalled vehicles manufactured by MLC.
In August 2017, the Southern District granted our motion to dismiss the successor liability claims of plaintiffs in seven of the
sixteen states at issue on the motion and called for additional briefing to decide whether plaintiffs' claims can proceed in the other
nine states. In December 2017, the Southern District granted GM's motion and dismissed the plaintiffs' successor liability claims in
an additional state, but found that there are genuine issues of material fact that prevent summary judgment for GM in eight other
states. In January 2018, GM moved for reconsideration of certain portions of the Southern District's December 2017 summary
judgment ruling. That motion was granted in April 2018, dismissing plaintiffs' successor liability claims in any state where New
York law applies.
In September 2018, the Southern District granted our motion to dismiss claims for lost personal time (in 41 out of 47
jurisdictions) and certain unjust enrichment claims, but denied our motion to dismiss plaintiffs' economic loss claims in 27
jurisdictions under the "manifest defect" rule.
In August 2019, the Southern District granted our motion for summary judgment on plaintiffs’ economic loss “benefit of the
bargain” damage claims (the August 2019 Opinion). The Southern District held that plaintiffs’ conjoint analysis-based damages
model failed to establish that plaintiffs suffered difference-in-value damages and without such evidence, plaintiffs’ difference-in-
value damage claims fail under the laws of all three bellwether states: California, Missouri and Texas. Later in August 2019, the
bellwether plaintiffs filed a motion requesting that the Southern District reconsider its summary judgment decision or allow an
interlocutory appeal if reconsideration is denied. In December 2019, the Southern District denied plaintiffs' motion for
reconsideration of the August 2019 Opinion, but granted the plaintiffs' motion for certification of an interlocutory appeal. On April
1, 2020, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals (the Second Circuit) granted the bellwether plaintiffs' petition seeking leave to appeal
the August 2019 Opinion. On April 15, 2020, the bellwether plaintiffs and GM filed a Stipulation to withdraw the appeal from the
Second Circuit based on the class settlement agreement described below.
In September 2019, GM filed an updated motion for summary judgment on plaintiffs’ remaining economic loss claims that were
not addressed in the Southern District’s August 2019 Opinion and renewed its evidentiary motion seeking to strike the opinions of
plaintiff’s expert on plaintiffs’ alleged “lost time” damages associated with having the recall repairs performed.
In March 2020, GM, plaintiffs and the MLC GUC Trust (GUC Trust) reached a settlement agreement (Class Settlement
Agreement) to resolve on a national basis the economic loss claims of the proposed settlement class and proposed sub-classes,
consisting of consumers who purchased or leased GM vehicles covered by the seven 2014 safety recalls at issue in the Southern
District and the Bankruptcy Court. The proposed Class Settlement Agreement provides a common fund of approximately
$120 million for settlement class members, of which GM will fund approximately $70 million and the GUC Trust will fund the
remaining $50 million. GM will also pay attorneys’ fees and costs that may be awarded by the Southern District to plaintiffs’
counsel up to a maximum of $35 million. In April 2020, the Avoidance Action Trust (AAT), GM and plaintiffs reached a
83
Table of Contents
GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)
tentative settlement under which the AAT will pay an insignificant amount and will be added as a settling party to the Class
Settlement Agreement. During April and May 2020, the Southern District entered orders granting preliminary approval of the Class
Settlement Agreement.
In December 2020, the Southern District conducted a final fairness hearing and issued an order granting final approval of the
Class Settlement Agreement in its entirety. The order granting final approval became final, effective and binding in January 2021.
The deadline for class members to file claims is April 2021.
Contingently Issuable Shares  Under the Amended and Restated Master Sale and Purchase Agreement between GM and MLC,
GM was obligated to issue Adjustment Shares of our common stock if allowed general unsecured claims against the GUC Trust, as
estimated by the Bankruptcy Court, exceed $35.0 billion. 
In March 2020, in conjunction with the Class Settlement Agreement, the GUC Trust filed a motion in the Bankruptcy Court
seeking approval to enter into and take actions necessary to execute the Class Settlement Agreement, and seeking Bankruptcy Court
authorization permitting the GUC Trust to distribute $300 million of GUC Trust assets to its unitholders and entry into a mutual
release agreement with GM that would release GM from any and all claims, including any that would require GM to issue any
Adjustment Shares. Bankruptcy Court approval of the GUC Trust motion is a condition precedent to preliminary approval of the
Class Settlement Agreement by the Southern District. In April 2020, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order approving the GUC
Trust's motion in its entirety. In May 2020, the approval and the mutual release agreement became binding and enforceable and GM
was fully released from its potential Adjustment Shares obligation.
Personal Injury Claims We also are aware of less than one hundred active personal injury actions, exclusive of matters subject to
settlements in principal, pending in various courts in the U.S. and Canada alleging injury or death as a result of defects that may be
the subject of the 2014 recalls. In general, these cases seek recovery for purported compensatory damages, punitive damages and/or
other relief. Since 2016, several bellwether trials of these cases have taken place in the Southern District and in a Texas state court,
which is administering a Texas state multi-district litigation. None of these trials resulted in a finding of liability against GM.
Government Matters In connection with the 2014 recalls, we have from time to time received subpoenas and other requests for
information related to investigations by agencies or other representatives of U.S. federal, state and the Canadian governments. GM
is cooperating with all reasonable pending requests for information. Any existing governmental matters or investigations could in
the future result in the imposition of damages, fines, civil consent orders, civil and criminal penalties or other remedies.
The total amount accrued for the 2014 recalls at December 31, 2020, reflects amounts for a combination of settled but unpaid
matters, and for the remaining unsettled investigations, claims and/or lawsuits relating to the ignition switch recalls and other
related recalls to the extent that such matters are probable and can be reasonably estimated. The amounts accrued for those
unsettled investigations, claims, and/or lawsuits represent a combination of our best single point estimates where determinable and,
where no such single point estimate is determinable, our estimate of the low end of the range of probable loss with regard to such
matters, if that is determinable. We will continue to consider resolution of pending matters involving ignition switch recalls and
other recalls where it makes sense to do so.
GM Korea Wage Litigation GM Korea is party to litigation with current and former hourly employees in the appellate court and
Incheon District Court in Incheon, Korea. The group actions, which in the aggregate involve more than 10,000 employees, allege
that GM Korea failed to include bonuses and certain allowances in its calculation of Ordinary Wages due under Korean regulations.
In 2012 the Seoul High Court (an intermediate-level appellate court) affirmed a decision in one of these group actions involving
five GM Korea employees which was contrary to GM Korea's position. GM Korea appealed to the Supreme Court of the Republic
of Korea (Korean Supreme Court). In 2014 the Korean Supreme Court largely agreed with GM Korea's legal arguments and
remanded the case to the Seoul High Court for consideration consistent with earlier Korean Supreme Court precedent holding that
while fixed bonuses should be included in the calculation of Ordinary Wages, claims for retroactive application of this rule would
be barred under certain circumstances. In 2015, on reconsideration, the Seoul High Court held in GM Korea's favor, after which the
plaintiffs appealed to the Korean Supreme Court. In July 2020, the Korean Supreme Court held in GM Korea's favor. In light of this
decision, we believe the probability that we will incur a material loss is remote and we estimate our loss in excess of amounts
accrued is insignificant at December 31, 2020.

Table of Contents
GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)
GM Korea is also party to litigation with current and former salaried employees over allegations relating to Ordinary Wages
regulation and whether to include fixed bonuses in the calculation of Ordinary Wages. In 2017, the Seoul High Court held that
certain workers are not barred from filing retroactive wage claims. GM Korea appealed this ruling to the Korean Supreme Court.
The Korean Supreme Court has not yet rendered a decision. We estimate our reasonably possible loss in excess of amounts accrued
to be approximately $190 million at December 31, 2020. Both the scope of claims asserted and GM Korea's assessment of any or
all of the individual claim elements may change if new information becomes available or the legal or regulatory frameworks
change.
GM Korea is also party to litigation with current and former subcontract workers over allegations that they are entitled to the
same wages and benefits provided to full-time employees, and to be hired as full-time employees. In May 2018 and September
2020, the Korean labor authorities issued adverse administrative orders finding that GM Korea must hire certain current subcontract
workers as full-time employees. GM Korea appealed the May 2018 order and plans to appeal the September 2020 order. In June
2020, the Seoul High Court ruled against GM Korea in one of the subcontract worker claims. GM Korea has appealed this decision
to the Korean Supreme Court. At December 31, 2020, our accrual covering certain asserted claims and claims that we believe are
probable of assertion and for which liability is probable was approximately $240 million. We estimate the reasonably possible loss
in excess of amounts accrued for other current subcontract workers who may assert similar claims to be approximately $120
million at December 31, 2020. We are currently unable to estimate any possible loss or range of loss that may result from additional
claims that may be asserted by former subcontract workers.
GM Brazil Indirect Tax Claim In 2019, the Superior Court of Brazil rendered favorable decisions on three cases brought by GM
Brazil challenging whether a certain state value-added tax should be included in the calculation of federal gross receipts taxes.
Those decisions granted the Company the right to recover, through offset of federal tax liabilities, certain amounts collected by the
government between August 2001 and February 2017. As a result, GM Brazil recorded pre-tax recoveries of $1.4 billion in
Automotive and other cost of sales in the year ended December 31, 2019. Realization of these recoveries depends on the timing of
administrative approvals and generation of federal tax liabilities eligible for offset. The Brazilian IRS has filed a Motion of
Clarification on this matter with the Brazilian Supreme Court, which motion is awaiting decision. In addition, we expect third
parties to make claims on some or all of the pre-tax recoveries, against which GM intends to defend.
Other Litigation-Related Liability and Tax Administrative Matters Various other legal actions, including class actions,
governmental investigations, claims and proceedings, are pending against us or our related companies or joint ventures, including
matters arising out of alleged product defects; employment-related matters; product and workplace safety, vehicle emissions and
fuel economy regulations; product warranties; financial services; dealer, supplier and other contractual relationships; government
regulations relating to competition issues; tax-related matters not subject to the provision of Accounting Standards Codification
740, Income Taxes (indirect tax-related matters); product design, manufacture and performance; consumer protection laws; and
environmental protection laws, including laws regulating air emissions, water discharges, waste management and environmental
remediation from stationary sources.
There are several putative class actions pending against GM in federal courts in the U.S. and in the Provincial Courts in Canada
alleging that various vehicles sold, including model year 2011-2016 Duramax Diesel Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra
vehicles, violate federal, state and foreign emission standards. We are unable to estimate any reasonably possible loss or range of
loss that may result from these actions. GM has also faced a series of additional lawsuits in the U.S. based on these allegations,
including putative shareholder class actions claiming violations of federal securities law and a shareholder demand lawsuit. The
securities lawsuits have been voluntarily dismissed by the plaintiffs in those actions.
We believe that appropriate accruals have been established for losses that are probable and can be reasonably estimated. It is
possible that the resolution of one or more of these matters could exceed the amounts accrued in an amount that could be material
to our results of operations. We also from time to time receive subpoenas and other inquiries or requests for information from
agencies or other representatives of U.S. federal, state and foreign governments on a variety of issues.
Indirect tax-related matters are being litigated globally pertaining to value added taxes, customs, duties, sales, property taxes and
other non-income tax related tax exposures. The various non-U.S. labor-related matters include claims from current and former
employees related to alleged unpaid wage, benefit, severance and other compensation matters. Certain administrative proceedings
are indirect tax-related and may require that we deposit funds in escrow or provide an alternative form of security. Some of the
matters may involve compensatory, punitive or other treble damage claims, environmental remediation programs or sanctions that,
if granted, could require us to pay damages or make other expenditures in amounts that could not be reasonably estimated at
December 31, 2020. We believe that appropriate accruals have been established for losses that are

probable and can be reasonably estimated. For indirect tax-related matters we estimate our reasonably possible loss in excess of
amounts accrued to be up to approximately $750 million at December 31, 2020.
Takata Matters In May 2016, NHTSA issued an amended consent order requiring Takata to file defect information reports (DIRs)
for previously unrecalled front airbag inflators that contain phased-stabilized ammonium nitrate-based propellant without a
moisture absorbing desiccant on a multi-year, risk-based schedule through 2019 impacting tens of millions of vehicles produced by
numerous automotive manufacturers. NHTSA concluded that the likely root cause of the rupturing of the airbag inflators is a
function of time, temperature cycling and environmental moisture.
In cooperation with NHTSA we filed Preliminary DIRs covering certain of our GMT900 vehicles, which are full-size pickup
trucks and SUVs, and petitions for inconsequentiality with respect to the vehicles subject to those Preliminary DIRs.
In November 2020, NHTSA denied GM's petitions for inconsequentiality relating to the Takata passenger-side inflators in certain
GMT900 vehicles. NHTSA has directed that we replace the airbag inflators in the vehicles in question, and we have decided not to
contest NHTSA's decision. While we have already begun the process of executing the recall, given the number of vehicles in this
population, the recall will take several years to be completed.
Accordingly, in the three months ended December 31, 2020, we recorded a warranty accrual of $1.1 billion for the expected costs
of complying with the recall remedy.
GM has recalled certain vehicles sold outside of the U.S. to replace Takata inflators in those vehicles. There are significant
differences in vehicle and inflator design between the relevant vehicles sold internationally and those sold in the U.S. We continue
to gather and analyze evidence about these inflators and to share our findings with regulators. Additional recalls, if any, could be
material to our results of operations and cash flows. We continue to monitor the international situation.
There are several putative class actions that have been filed against GM, including in the federal courts in the U.S., in the
Provincial Courts in Canada, and in Mexico and Israel, arising out of allegations that airbag inflators manufactured by Takata are
defective. At this stage of these proceedings, we are unable to provide an estimate of the amounts or range of possible loss.
Product Liability We recorded liabilities of $589 million and $544 million in Accrued liabilities and Other liabilities at December
31, 2020 and 2019, for the expected cost of all known product liability claims, plus an estimate of the expected cost for product
liability claims that have already been incurred and are expected to be filed in the future for which we are self-insured. It is
reasonably possible that our accruals for product liability claims may increase in future periods in material amounts, although we
cannot estimate a reasonable range of incremental loss based on currently available information. Other than claims relating to the
ignition switch recalls discussed above, we believe that any judgment against us involving our and MLC products for actual
damages will be adequately covered by our recorded accruals and, where applicable, excess liability insurance coverage.
Guarantees We enter into indemnification agreements for liability claims involving products manufactured primarily by certain
joint ventures. These guarantees terminate in years ranging from 2021 to 2026 or upon the occurrence of specific events or are
ongoing. We believe that the related potential costs incurred are adequately covered by our recorded accruals, which are
insignificant. The maximum future undiscounted payments mainly based on vehicles sold to date were $3.1 billion and $2.6 billion
for these guarantees at December 31, 2020 and 2019, the majority of which relates to the indemnification agreements.
We provide payment guarantees on commercial loans outstanding with third parties such as dealers. In some instances certain
assets of the party or our payables to the party whose debt or performance we have guaranteed may offset, to some degree, the
amount of any potential future payments. We are also exposed to residual value guarantees associated with certain sales to rental
car companies.
We periodically enter into agreements that incorporate indemnification provisions in the normal course of business. It is not
possible to estimate our maximum exposure under these indemnifications or guarantees due to the conditional nature of these
obligations. Insignificant amounts have been recorded for such obligations as the majority of them are not probable or estimable at
this time and the fair value of the guarantees at issuance was insignificant. Refer to Note 22 for additional information on our
indemnification obligations to PSA Group under the Master Agreement (the Agreement).

Credit Cards Credit card programs offer rebates that can be applied primarily against the purchase or lease of our vehicles. At
December 31, 2020 and 2019, our redemption liability was insignificant, our deferred revenue was $252 million and $253 million,
and qualified cardholders had rebates available, net of deferred program revenue, of $1.3 billion and $1.4 billion. Our redemption
liability and deferred revenue are recorded in Accrued liabilities and Other liabilities.
Operating Leases Our portfolio of leases primarily consists of real estate office space, manufacturing and warehousing facilities,
land and equipment. Certain leases contain escalation clauses and renewal or purchase options, and generally our leases have no
residual value guarantees or material covenants. We exclude leases with a term of one year or less from our balance sheet, and do
not separate non-lease components from our real estate leases.
Rent expense under operating leases was $317 million and $354 million in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. Prior to
adoption of ASU 2016-02, "Leases", rent expense under operating leases was $300 million in the year ended December 31, 2018.
Variable lease costs were insignificant in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, operating
lease right of use assets in Other assets were $1.0 billion and $1.1 billion, operating lease liabilities in Accrued liabilities were
$209 million and $239 million and non-current operating lease liabilities in Other liabilities were $969 million and $1.0 billion.
Operating lease right of use assets obtained in exchange for lease obligations were $222 million and $497 million in the years
ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. Our undiscounted future lease obligations related to operating leases having initial terms in
excess of one year are $251 million, $205 million, $196 million, $151 million, $122 million and $437 million for the years 2021,
2022, 2023, 2024, 2025 and thereafter, with imputed interest of $184 million as of December 31, 2020. The weighted average
discount rate was 4.0% and 4.2% and the weighted-average remaining lease term was 7.4 years and 7.2 years at December 31, 2020
and 2019. Payments for operating leases included in Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities were $309 million and
$337 million in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. Lease agreements that have not yet commenced were $150 million
at December 31, 2020.

Valuation Allowances During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, valuation allowances against deferred tax assets of
$9.1 billion and $8.1 billion were comprised of cumulative losses, credits and other timing differences, primarily in Germany,
Spain and South Korea.
Uncertain Tax Positions The following table summarizes activity of the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits:
Years Ended December 31,
2020 2019 2018
Balance at beginning of period $ 775 $ 1,341 $ 1,557 
Additions to current year tax positions 435 18 292

Other (5) 5 (40)
Balance at end of period $ 1,086 $ 775 $ 1,341 
At December 31, 2020 and 2019 there were $851 million and $539 million of unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would
favorably affect our effective tax rate in the future. In the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 income tax related
interest and penalties were insignificant. At December 31, 2020 and 2019 we had liabilities of $92 million and $117 million for
income tax related interest and penalties.
At December 31, 2020 it is not possible to reasonably estimate the expected change to the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next twelve months.
Other Matters Income tax returns are filed in multiple jurisdictions and are subject to examination by taxing authorities
throughout the world. We have open tax years from 2011 to 2020 with various significant tax jurisdictions. Tax authorities may
have the ability to review and adjust net operating loss or tax credit carryforwards that were generated prior to these periods if
utilized in an open tax year. These open years contain matters that could be subject to differing interpretations of applicable tax
laws and regulations as they relate to the amount, character, timing or inclusion of revenue and expenses or the sustainability of
income tax credits for a given audit cycle.
Note 18. Restructuring and Other Initiatives
We have executed various restructuring and other initiatives and we may execute additional initiatives in the future, if necessary,
to streamline manufacturing capacity and reduce other costs to improve the utilization of remaining facilities. To the extent these
programs involve voluntary separations, a liability is generally recorded at the time offers to employees are accepted. To the extent
these programs provide separation benefits in accordance with pre-existing agreements, a liability is recorded once the amount is
probable and reasonably estimable. If employees are involuntarily terminated, a liability is generally recorded at the communication
date. Related charges are recorded in Automotive and other cost of sales and Automotive and other selling, general and
administrative expense.
The following table summarizes the reserves and charges related to restructuring and other initiatives, including postemployment
benefit reserves and charges:

certain emissions and product liabilities. We entered into a guarantee for the benefit of PSA Group and pursuant to which we agreed
to guarantee the Seller's obligation to indemnify PSA Group. Certain of these indemnification obligations are subject to time
limitations, thresholds and/or caps as to the amount of required payments.
Although the sale reduced our new vehicle presence in Europe, we may still be impacted by actions taken by regulators related to
vehicles sold before the sale. In Germany, the Kraftfahrt-Bundesamt (KBA) issued an order in November 2019, which converted a
voluntary recall initiated by Opel in 2017 and 2018 into a mandatory recall for allegedly failing to comply with certain emissions
regulations. However, because the overwhelming majority of vehicles have already received KBA-approved software calibration
updates pursuant to the voluntary recall, the number of vehicles subject to the mandatory recall is insignificant. The Seller may also
be obligated to indemnify PSA Group or otherwise absorb costs and expenses resulting from

the foregoing as well as certain related potential litigation costs, settlements, judgments and potential fines. In addition, at the
KBA's request, the German authorities re-opened a separate criminal investigation related to this matter that had previously been
closed with no action. At December 31, 2020, we have accrued an insignificant amount relating to these matters.
The results of the European Business operations recorded in Loss from discontinued operations, net were $70 million in the year
ended December 31, 2018. There was no income or loss from discontinued operations in the years ended December 31, 2020 and

Note 23. Stock Incentive Plans
GM Stock Incentive Awards We grant to certain employees RSUs, RSAs, PSUs and stock options (collectively, stock incentive
awards) under our 2016 Equity Incentive Plan and 2020 Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) and prior to the 2020 LTIP, under our
2017 and 2014 LTIP. The 2020 LTIP was approved by stockholders in June 2020. Any new awards granted after the approval of the
2020 LTIP in June 2020 will be issued under the 2020 LTIP. To the extent any shares remain available for issuance under the 2017
LTIP, the 2016 Equity Incentive Plan, and/or the 2014 LTIP, such shares will only be used to settle outstanding awards that were
previously granted under such plans prior to June 2020. Shares awarded under the plans are subject to forfeiture if the participant
leaves the company for reasons other than those permitted under the plans such as retirement, death or disability.
RSU awards granted either cliff vest or ratably vest generally over a three-year service period, as defined in the terms of each
award. PSU awards vest at the end of a three-year performance period, based on performance criteria determined by the Executive
Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors at the time of award. The number of shares earned may equal, exceed or be less
than the targeted number of shares depending on whether the performance criteria are met, surpassed or not met. Stock options
expire 10 years from the grant date. Our performance-based stock options vest ratably over 55 months based on the performance of
our common stock relative to that of a specified peer group. Our service-based stock options vest ratably over 19 months to three
years.
In connection with our acquisition of Cruise Automation, Inc. in May 2016, RSAs and PSUs in common shares of GM were
granted to employees of Cruise Holdings. The RSAs vest ratably, generally over a three-year service period. The PSUs are
contingent upon achievement of specific technology and commercialization milestones.

Our weighted-average assumptions used to value our stock options are a dividend yield of 4.25%, 3.90% and 3.69%, expected
volatility of 26.2%, 28.0% and 28.0%, a risk-free interest rate of 1.44%, 2.62% and 2.73%, and an expected option life of 5.97,
6.00 and 5.98 years for options issued during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. The expected volatility is based
on the average of the implied volatility of publicly traded options for our common stock.
Total compensation expense related to the above awards was $351 million, $456 million and $316 million in the years ended
December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.
At December 31, 2020, the total unrecognized compensation expense for nonvested equity awards granted was $213 million.
This expense is expected to be recorded over a weighted-average period of 1.3 years. The total fair value of stock incentive awards
vested was $275 million, $287 million and $317 million in the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.
Cruise Stock Incentive Awards In addition to the awards noted above, RSUs were granted to Cruise employees in common
shares of Cruise Holdings in the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. Stock options were granted in common shares of
Cruise Holdings in the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. There were no Cruise stock options granted in the year ended
December 31, 2020. These awards were granted under the 2018 Employee Incentive Plan approved by Cruise Holdings' Board of
Directors in August 2018. Shares awarded under the plan are subject to forfeiture if the participant leaves the company for reasons
other than those permitted under the plan. Stock options vest ratably over four to 10 years, as defined in the terms of each award.
Stock options expire 10 years from the grant date. RSU awards granted vest upon the satisfaction of both a service condition and a
liquidity condition. The service condition for the majority of these awards is satisfied over four years. The liquidity condition is
satisfied upon the earlier of the date of a change in control transaction or the consummation of an initial public offering.
Total compensation expense related to Cruise Holdings’ share-based awards was insignificant for the years ended December 31,
2020, 2019 and 2018. No share-based compensation expense had been recognized for the RSUs because the liquidity condition
described above was not met at December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. Total unrecognized compensation expense for Cruise
Holdings’ nonvested equity awards granted was $863 million at December 31, 2020, which was primarily comprised of the RSUs
for which the liquidity condition had not been met. Total units outstanding were 79.3 million at December 31, 2020. The expense
related to stock options is expected to be recorded over a weighted-average period of 7.1 years. The timing of the expense related to
RSUs will depend upon the date of the satisfaction of the liquidity condition.
Note 24. Segment Reporting
We analyze the results of our business through the following reportable segments: GMNA, GMI, Cruise and GM Financial. The
European Business is presented as discontinued operations and is excluded from our segment results for all periods presented. The
European Business was previously reported as our GM Europe segment and part of GM Financial. The chief operating decision-
maker evaluates the operating results and performance of our automotive segments and Cruise through EBIT-adjusted, which is
presented net of noncontrolling interests. The chief operating decision-maker evaluates GM Financial through EBT-adjusted
because interest income and interest expense are part of operating results when assessing and measuring the operational and
financial performance of the segment. Each segment has a manager responsible for executing our strategic initiatives. While not all
vehicles within a segment are individually profitable on a fully allocated cost basis, those vehicles attract customers to dealer
showrooms and help maintain sales volumes for other, more profitable vehicles and contribute towards meeting required fuel
efficiency standards. As a result of these and other factors, we do not manage our business on an individual brand or vehicle basis.

Substantially all of the trucks, crossovers, cars and automobile parts produced are marketed through retail dealers in North
America and through distributors and dealers outside of North America, the substantial majority of which are independently owned.
In addition to the products sold to dealers for consumer retail sales, trucks, crossovers and cars are also sold to fleet customers,
including daily rental car companies, commercial fleet customers, leasing companies and governments. Fleet sales are completed
through the dealer network and in some cases directly with fleet customers. Retail and fleet customers can obtain a wide range of
after-sale vehicle services and products through the dealer network, such as maintenance, light repairs, collision repairs, vehicle
accessories and extended service warranties.
GMNA meets the demands of customers in North America with vehicles developed, manufactured and/or marketed under the
Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet and GMC brands. GMI primarily meets the demands of customers outside North America with vehicles
developed, manufactured and/or marketed under the Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet, GMC, and Holden brands. We also have equity
ownership stakes in entities that meet the demands of customers in other countries, primarily China, with vehicles developed,
manufactured and/or marketed under the Baojun, Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet and Wuling brands. Cruise is our global segment
responsible for the development and commercialization of autonomous vehicle technology, and includes autonomous vehicle-
related engineering and other costs.
Our automotive interest income and interest expense, legacy costs from the Opel/Vauxhall Business (primarily pension costs),
corporate expenditures and certain nonsegment specific revenues and expenses are recorded centrally in Corporate. Corporate
assets primarily consist of cash and cash equivalents, marketable debt securities, PSA warrants and intercompany balances.
Retained net underfunded pension liabilities related to the European Business are also recorded in Corporate. All intersegment
balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

In January 2021, Cruise Holdings issued Class G Preferred Shares in exchange for $2.2 billion from Microsoft and other
investors, including $1.0 billion from General Motors Holdings LLC. As a result, Cruise Holdings has fallen below the ownership
threshold required for inclusion in our U.S. consolidated income tax returns. In the three months ended March 31, 2021, we will
establish a valuation allowance of approximately $350 million against deferred tax assets that may not be realizable. In addition,
we, Cruise Holdings and Microsoft entered into a long-term strategic relationship to accelerate the commercialization of self-
driving vehicles with Microsoft being the preferred cloud provider.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures
Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance
that information required to be disclosed in reports filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the specified time periods and accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer
and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.
Our management, with the participation of our CEO and CFO, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act) as of December 31, 2020 as required
by paragraph (b) of Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15. Based on this evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls
and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2020.
Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and
maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act.
This system is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Because of the inherent limitations of
internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls,
misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
Our management performed an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting at December 31,
2020, utilizing the criteria discussed in the “Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)” issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The objective of this assessment was to determine whether our internal
control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2020. Based on management's assessment, we have concluded
that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2020.
The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent
registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report included herein.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There have not been any changes in our internal control over financial
reporting during the three months ended December 31, 2020 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we are monitoring our control
environment with increased vigilance to ensure changes as a result of physical distancing are addressed and all increased risks are
mitigated. For additional information refer to Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors.
