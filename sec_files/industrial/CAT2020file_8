PART I
Item 1.Business.
General
 
Originally organized as Caterpillar Tractor Co. in 1925 in the State of California, our company was reorganized as Caterpillar Inc.
in 1986 in the State of Delaware.  As used herein, the term “Caterpillar,” “we,” “us,” “our” or “the company” refers to Caterpillar
Inc. and its subsidiaries unless designated or identified otherwise.
 
Overview
 
With 2019 sales and revenues of $53.800 billion, Caterpillar is the world’s leading manufacturer of construction and mining
equipment, diesel and natural gas engines, industrial gas turbines and diesel-electric locomotives.  The company principally
operates through its three primary segments - Construction Industries, Resource Industries and Energy & Transportation - and also
provides financing and related services through its Financial Products segment. Caterpillar is also a leading U.S. exporter.  Through
a global network of independent dealers and direct sales of certain products, Caterpillar builds long-term relationships with
customers around the world.
 
Currently, we have five operating segments, of which four are reportable segments and are described below. 
 
Categories of Business Organization
 
1.               Machinery, Energy & Transportation — Represents the aggregate total of Construction Industries, Resource Industries,
Energy & Transportation and All Other operating segment and related corporate items and eliminations.
 
2.               Financial Products — Primarily includes the company’s Financial Products Segment.  This category includes Caterpillar
Financial Services Corporation (Cat Financial), Caterpillar Insurance Holdings Inc. (Insurance Services) and their respective
subsidiaries.
 
Other information about our operations in 2019, including certain risks associated with our operations, is included in Part II, Item 7
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
 
Construction Industries
 
Our Construction Industries segment is primarily responsible for supporting customers using machinery in infrastructure, forestry
and building construction.  The majority of machine sales in this segment are made in the heavy and general construction, rental,
quarry and aggregates markets and mining.
 
The nature of customer demand for construction machinery varies around the world.  Customers in developing economies often
prioritize purchase price in making their investment decisions, while customers in developed economies generally weigh
productivity and other performance criteria that contribute to lower owning and operating costs over the lifetime of the machine. 
To meet customer expectations in developing economies, Caterpillar developed differentiated product offerings that target
customers in those markets, including our SEM brand machines.  We believe that these customer-driven product innovations enable
us to compete more effectively in developing economies. The majority of Construction Industries' research and development
spending in 2019 focused on the next generation of construction machines.
 
The competitive environment for construction machinery is characterized by some global competitors and many regional and
specialized local competitors.  Examples of global competitors include CASE (part of CNH Industrial N.V.), Deere Construction &
Forestry (part of Deere & Company), Doosan Infracore Co., Ltd., Hitachi Construction Machinery Co., Ltd., Hyundai Construction
Equipment Co., Ltd., J.C. Bamford Excavators Ltd., Kobelco Construction Machinery (part of Kobe Steel, Ltd), Komatsu Ltd.,
Kubota Farm & Industrial Machinery (part of Kubota Corporation), and Volvo Construction Equipment (part of the Volvo Group). 
As an example of regional and local competitors, our competitors in China also include Guangxi LiuGong Machinery Co., Ltd.,
Longking Holdings Ltd., Sany Heavy Industry Co., Ltd., XCMG Group, Shandong Lingong Construction Machinery Co., Ltd.
(SDLG, part of the Volvo Group) and Shantui Construction Machinery Co., Ltd., (part of Shandong Heavy Industry Group Co.). 
Each of these companies has varying product lines that compete with Caterpillar products, and each has varying degrees of regional
focus.

Resource Industries
 
The Resource Industries segment is primarily responsible for supporting customers using machinery in mining, heavy construction,
quarry and aggregates, waste and material handling applications.  Caterpillar offers a broad product range and services to deliver
comprehensive solutions for our mining customers. We manufacture high productivity equipment for both surface and underground
mining operations around the world. Our equipment is used to extract and haul copper, iron ore, coal, oil sands, aggregates, gold
and other minerals and ores. In addition to equipment, Resource Industries also develops and sells technology products and services
to provide customers fleet management systems, equipment management analytics and autonomous machine capabilities.
Customers in most markets place an emphasis on equipment that is highly productive, reliable and provides the lowest total cost of
ownership over the life of the equipment. In some developing markets, customers often prioritize purchase price in making their
investment decisions.  We believe our ability to control the integration and design of key machine components represents a
competitive advantage. Our research and development efforts remain focused on providing customers the lowest total cost of
ownership enabled through the highest quality, most productive products and services in the industry.

Regulatory emissions standards require us to continue to make investments as new products and new regulations are introduced. 
On-going compliance with these regulations remains a focus.  Emissions compliance in developing markets is complex due to
rapidly evolving and unique requirements where enforcement processes can often vary.  We employ robust product development
and manufacturing processes to help us comply with these regulations. 
 
The competitive environment for reciprocating engines in marine, oil and gas, industrial and electric power generation systems
along with turbines in oil and gas and electric power generation consists of a few larger global competitors that compete in a variety
of markets that Caterpillar serves, and a substantial number of smaller companies that compete in a limited-size product range,
geographic region and/or application.  Principal global competitors include Cummins Inc., Deutz AG, INNIO, Rolls-Royce Power
Systems and Wärtsilä Corp.  Other competitors, such as Fiat Industrial SpA (CNHI), GE Power, Kawasaki Heavy Industries Energy
System & Plant Engineering, MAN Energy Solutions (VW), Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd., Siemens Power and Gas,Volvo
Penta AB, Weichai Power Co., Ltd., and other emerging market competitors compete in certain markets in which Caterpillar
competes. An additional set of competitors, including Aggreko plc, Baker Hughes Co., Generac Holdings, Kohler Power Systems,
and others, are primarily packagers who source engines and/or other components from domestic and international suppliers and
market products regionally and internationally through a variety of distribution channels.  In rail-related businesses, our global

Financial Products Segment
 
The business of our Financial Products Segment is primarily conducted by Cat Financial, Insurance Services and their respective
subsidiaries.  Cat Financial is a wholly owned finance subsidiary of Caterpillar Inc. and its primary business is to provide retail and
wholesale financing alternatives for Caterpillar products to customers and dealers around the world.  Retail financing is primarily
comprised of the financing of Caterpillar equipment, machinery and engines. Cat Financial also provides financing for vehicles,
power generation facilities and marine vessels that, in most cases, incorporate Caterpillar products. In addition to retail financing,
Cat Financial provides wholesale financing to Caterpillar dealers and purchases short-term trade receivables from Caterpillar. The
various financing plans offered by Cat Financial are primarily designed to increase the opportunity for sales of Caterpillar products
and generate financing income for Cat Financial.  A significant portion of Cat Financial’s activity is conducted in North America,
with additional offices and subsidiaries in Latin America, Asia/Pacific, Europe, Africa and the Middle East.
 
For over 35 years, Cat Financial has been providing financing in the various markets in which it participates, contributing to its
knowledge of asset values, industry trends, product structuring and customer needs.
 
In certain instances, Cat Financial’s operations are subject to supervision and regulation by state, federal and various foreign
governmental authorities, and may be subject to various laws and judicial and administrative decisions imposing various
requirements and restrictions which, among other things, (i) regulate credit granting activities and the administration of loans,
(ii) establish maximum interest rates, finance charges and other charges, (iii) require disclosures to customers and investors,
(iv) govern secured transactions, (v) set collection, foreclosure, repossession and other trade practices and (vi) regulate the use and
reporting of information related to a borrower’s credit experience.  Cat Financial’s ability to comply with these and other
governmental and legal requirements and restrictions affects its operations.
Cat Financial’s retail loans (totaling 49 percent*) include:
•Loans that allow customers and dealers to use their Caterpillar equipment or other assets as collateral to obtain financing
(24 percent*).
3
Table of Contents
•Installment sale contracts, which are equipment loans that enable customers to purchase equipment with a down payment
or trade-in and structure payments over time (25 percent*).
Cat Financial's retail leases (totaling 35 percent*) include:
•Finance (non-tax) leases, where the lessee for tax purposes is considered to be the owner of the equipment during the term
of the lease, that either require or allow the customer to purchase the equipment for a fixed price at the end of the term (22
percent*).
•Tax leases that are classified as either operating or finance leases for financial accounting purposes, depending on the
characteristics of the lease.  For tax purposes, Cat Financial is considered the owner of the equipment (12 percent*).
•Governmental lease-purchase plans in the U.S. that offer low interest rates and flexible terms to qualified non-federal
government agencies (1 percent*).
Cat Financial also purchases short-term receivables from Caterpillar (14 percent*).
 
Cat Financial’s wholesale loans and leases (2 percent*) include inventory/rental programs, which provide assistance to dealers by
financing their new Caterpillar inventory and rental fleets.
 
*Indicates the percentage of Cat Financial’ s total portfolio at December 31, 2019.  We define total portfolio as total finance receivables (net of
unearned income and allowance for credit losses) plus equipment on operating leases, less accumulated depreciation. For more information on the
above and Cat Financial’ s concentration of credit risk, please refer to Note 7 — “Cat Financial Financing Activities” of Part II, Item 8 "Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data."
_____________________________
 
Cat Financial operates in a highly competitive environment, with financing for users of Caterpillar equipment available through a
variety of sources, principally commercial banks and finance and leasing companies. Cat Financial’s competitors include, Australia
and New Zealand Banking Group Limited, Banc of America Leasing & Capital LLC, BNP Paribas Leasing Solutions Limited,
Wells Fargo Equipment Finance Inc. and various other banks and finance companies.  In addition, many of our manufacturing
competitors own financial subsidiaries, such as John Deere Capital Corporation, Komatsu Financial L.P., Kubota Credit
Corporation and Volvo Financial Services, which utilize below-market interest rate programs (funded by the manufacturer) to assist
machine sales.  Caterpillar and Cat Financial work together to provide a broad array of financial merchandising programs around
the world to meet these competitive offers.
 
Cat Financial’s financial results are largely dependent upon the ability of Caterpillar dealers to sell equipment and customers’
willingness to enter into financing or leasing agreements.  Cat Financial is also affected by, among other things, the availability of
funds from its financing sources, its cost of funds relative to its competitors and general economic conditions such as inflation and
market interest rates.
 
Cat Financial has a match-funding policy that addresses interest rate risk by aligning the interest rate profile (fixed or floating rate)
of its debt portfolio with the interest rate profile of its receivables portfolio within predetermined ranges on an ongoing basis.  In
connection with that policy, Cat Financial uses interest rate derivative instruments to modify the debt structure to match assets
within the receivables portfolio. This matched funding reduces the volatility of margins between interest-bearing assets and
interest-bearing liabilities, regardless of which direction interest rates move. For more information regarding match funding, please
see Note 4 — “Derivative financial instruments and risk management” of Part II, Item 8 "Financial Statements and Supplementary
Data."  See also the risk factors associated with our financial products business included in Item 1 A. of this Form 10-K.
In managing foreign currency risk for Cat Financial’s operations, the objective is to minimize earnings volatility resulting from
conversion and the remeasurement of net foreign currency balance sheet positions, and future transactions denominated in foreign
currencies.  This policy allows the use of foreign currency forward, option and cross currency contracts to offset the risk of
currency mismatch between the assets and liabilities, and exchange rate risk associated with future transactions denominated in
foreign currencies.

Table of Contents
Cat Financial provides financing only when certain criteria are met. Credit decisions are based on a variety of credit quality factors
including prior payment experience, customer financial information, credit-rating agency ratings, loan-to-value ratios and other
internal metrics. Cat Financial typically maintains a security interest in retail-financed equipment and requires physical damage
insurance coverage on financed equipment.  Cat Financial finances a significant portion of Caterpillar dealers’ sales and inventory
of Caterpillar equipment throughout the world.  Cat Financial’s competitive position is improved by marketing programs offered in
conjunction with Caterpillar and/or Caterpillar dealers.  Under these programs, Caterpillar, or the dealer, funds an amount at the
outset of the transaction, which Cat Financial then recognizes as revenue over the term of the financing.  We believe that these
marketing programs provide Cat Financial a significant competitive advantage in financing Caterpillar products.

 Acquisitions
 
Information related to acquisitions appears in Note 24 — “Acquisitions” of Part II, Item 8 "Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data."
 
Competitive Environment
 
Caterpillar products and product support services are sold worldwide into a variety of highly competitive markets.  In all markets,
we compete on the basis of product performance, customer service, quality and price.  From time to time, the intensity of
competition results in price discounting in a particular industry or region.  Such price discounting puts pressure on margins and can
negatively impact operating profit. Outside the United States, certain competitors enjoy competitive advantages inherent to
operating in their home countries or regions.
 
Raw Materials and Component Products
 
We source our raw materials and manufactured components from suppliers both domestically and internationally. These purchases
include unformed materials and rough and finished parts.  Unformed materials include a variety of steel products, which are then
cut or formed to shape and machined in our facilities. Rough parts include various sized steel and iron castings and forgings, which
are machined to final specification levels inside our facilities. Finished parts are ready to assemble components, which are made
either to Caterpillar specifications or to supplier developed specifications.  We machine and assemble some of the components used
in our machines, engines and power generation units and to support our after-market dealer parts sales. We also purchase various
goods and services used in production, logistics, offices and product development processes.  We maintain global strategic sourcing
models to meet our global facilities’ production needs while building long-term supplier relationships and leveraging enterprise
spend.  We expect our suppliers to maintain, at all times, industry-leading levels of quality and the ability to timely deliver raw
materials and component products for our machine and engine products. However, increases in demand have led to parts and
components constraints across some products. We use a variety of agreements with suppliers to protect our intellectual property and
processes to monitor and mitigate risks of the supply base causing a business disruption.  The risks monitored include supplier
financial viability, the ability to increase or decrease production levels, business continuity, quality and delivery.
 
Patents and Trademarks
 
We own a number of patents and trademarks, which have been obtained over a period of years and relate to the products we
manufacture and the services we provide. These patents and trademarks are generally considered beneficial to our business. We do
not regard our business as being dependent upon any single patent or group of patents.
Order Backlog
 
The dollar amount of backlog believed to be firm was approximately $13.7 billion at December 31, 2019 and $16.5 billion at
December 31, 2018. Compared with year-end 2018, the order backlog decreased across the three primary segments. Of the total
backlog at December 31, 2019, approximately $3.8 billion was not expected to be filled in 2020. 
Dealers and Distributors
 
Our machines are distributed principally through a worldwide organization of dealers (dealer network), 46 located in the United
States and 119 located outside the United States, serving 191 countries.  Reciprocating engines are sold principally through the
dealer network and to other manufacturers for use in products. Some of the reciprocating engines manufactured by our subsidiary
Perkins Engines Company Limited are also sold through its worldwide network of 67 distributors covering 178 countries. The FG
Wilson branded electric power generation systems primarily manufactured by our subsidiary Caterpillar Northern Ireland Limited
are sold through its worldwide network of 150 distributors covering 109 countries.  Some of the large, medium speed reciprocating
engines are also sold under the MaK brand through a worldwide network of 20 distributors covering 130 countries. 
 
Our dealers do not deal exclusively with our products; however, in most cases sales and servicing of our products are the dealers’
principal business.  Some products, primarily turbines and locomotives, are sold directly to end customers through sales forces
employed by the company.  At times, these employees are assisted by independent sales representatives.

Table of Contents
While the large majority of our worldwide dealers are independently owned and operated, we own and operate a dealership in
Japan that covers approximately 80% of the Japanese market: Nippon Caterpillar Division. We are currently operating this Japanese
dealer directly and its results are reported in the All Other operating segment. There are also three independent dealers in the
Southern Region of Japan.
 
For Caterpillar branded products, the company’s relationship with each of its independent dealers is memorialized in standard sales
and service agreements.  Pursuant to these agreements, the company grants the dealer the right to purchase and sell its products and
to service the products in a specified geographic service territory.  Prices to dealers are established by the company after receiving
input from dealers on transactional pricing in the marketplace.  The company also agrees to defend its intellectual property and to
provide warranty and technical support to the dealer.  The agreement further grants the dealer a non-exclusive license to use the
company’s trademarks, service marks and brand names.  In some instances, a separate trademark agreement exists between the
company and a dealer.
 
In exchange for these rights, the agreement obligates the dealer to develop and promote the sale of the company’s products to
current and prospective customers in the dealer’s service territory.  Each dealer agrees to employ adequate sales and support
personnel to market, sell and promote the company’s products, demonstrate and exhibit the products, perform the company’s
product improvement programs, inform the company concerning any features that might affect the safe operation of any of the
company’s products and maintain detailed books and records of the dealer’s financial condition, sales and inventories and make
these books and records available at the company’s reasonable request.
 
These sales and service agreements are terminable at will by either party primarily upon 90 days written notice.
 
Employment
 
As of December 31, 2019, we employed about 102,300 full-time persons of whom approximately 58,700 were located outside the
United States. In the United States, we employed approximately 43,600 employees, most of whom are at-will employees and,
therefore, not subject to any type of employment contract or agreement.  At select business units, certain highly specialized
employees have been hired under employment contracts that specify a term of employment, pay and other benefits.

As of December 31, 2019, there were approximately 8,290 U.S. hourly production employees who were covered by collective
bargaining agreements with various labor unions, including The United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement
Workers of America (UAW), The International Association of Machinists and The United Steelworkers. Approximately 6,880 of
such employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with the UAW that expire on December 17, 2020 and March 1,
2023. Outside the United States, the company enters into employment contracts and agreements in those countries in which such
relationships are mandatory or customary. The provisions of these agreements generally correspond in each case with the required
or customary terms in the subject jurisdiction.

Environmental Matters
 
The company is regulated by federal, state and international environmental laws governing our use, transport and disposal of
substances and control of emissions. In addition to governing our manufacturing and other operations, these laws often impact the
development of our products, including, but not limited to, required compliance with air emissions standards applicable to internal
combustion engines. We have made, and will continue to make, significant research and development and capital expenditures to
comply with these emissions standards.
 
We are engaged in remedial activities at a number of locations, often with other companies, pursuant to federal and state laws. 
When it is probable we will pay remedial costs at a site, and those costs can be reasonably estimated, the investigation, remediation,
and operating and maintenance costs of the remedial action are accrued against our earnings.  Costs are accrued based on
consideration of currently available data and information with respect to each individual site, including available technologies,
current applicable laws and regulations, and prior remediation experience. Where no amount within a range of estimates is more
likely, we accrue the minimum. Where multiple potentially responsible parties are involved, we consider our proportionate share of
the probable costs. In formulating the estimate of probable costs, we do not consider amounts expected to be recovered from
insurance companies or others.  We reassess these accrued amounts on a quarterly basis. The amount recorded for environmental
remediation is not material and is included in the line item "Accrued expenses" in Statement 3 — "Consolidated Financial Position
at December 31" of Part II, Item 8 "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data." There is no more than a remote chance that a
material amount for remedial activities at any individual site, or at all the sites in the aggregate, will be required.

Item 1A.Risk Factors.
 
The statements in this section describe the most significant risks to our business and should be considered carefully in conjunction
with Part II, Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the “Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements” of Part II, Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” to this Form 10-K.  In
addition, the statements in this section and other sections of this Form 10-K, including in Part II, Item 7 “Management's Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” include “forward-looking statements” as that term is defined in the
Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and involve uncertainties that could significantly impact results.  Forward-looking
statements give current expectations or forecasts of future events about the company or our outlook.  You can identify forward-
looking statements by the fact they do not relate to historical or current facts and by the use of words such as “believe,” “expect,”
“estimate,” “anticipate,” “will be,” “should,” “plan,” “forecast,” “target,” “guide,” “project,” “intend,” “could” and similar words or
expressions.

Forward-looking statements are based on assumptions and on known risks and uncertainties. Although we believe we have been
prudent in our assumptions, any or all of our forward-looking statements may prove to be inaccurate, and we can make no
guarantees about our future performance.  Should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize or underlying assumptions
prove inaccurate, actual results could materially differ from past results and/or those anticipated, estimated or projected.
We undertake no obligation to publicly update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or
otherwise. You should, however, consult any subsequent disclosures we make in our filings with the SEC on Form 10-Q or Form 8-
K.
 
The following is a cautionary discussion of risks, uncertainties and assumptions that we believe are significant to our business. In
addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report, the following are some of the important factors that, individually or in the
aggregate, we believe could make our actual results differ materially from those described in any forward-looking statements. It is
impossible to predict or identify all such factors and, as a result, you should not consider the following factors to be a complete
discussion of risks, uncertainties and assumptions.
MACROECONOMIC RISKS
Our business and the industries we serve are highly sensitive to global and regional economic conditions.
 
Our results of operations are materially affected by economic conditions globally and regionally and in the particular industries we
serve.  The demand for our products and services tends to be cyclical and can be significantly reduced in periods of economic
weakness characterized by lower levels of government and business investment, lower levels of business confidence, lower
corporate earnings, high real interest rates, lower credit activity or tighter credit conditions, perceived or actual industry
overcapacity, higher unemployment and lower consumer spending. A prolonged period of economic weakness may also result in
increased expenses due to higher allowances for doubtful accounts and potential goodwill and asset impairment charges.  Economic
conditions vary across regions and countries, and demand for our products and services generally increases in those regions and
countries experiencing economic growth and investment.  Slower economic growth or a change in the global mix of regions and
countries experiencing economic growth and investment could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and
financial condition.
 
The energy, transportation and mining industries are major users of our products, including the coal, iron ore, gold, copper, oil and
natural gas industries.  Customers in these industries frequently base their decisions to purchase our products and services on the
expected future performance of these industries, which in turn are dependent in part on commodity prices. Prices of commodities in
these industries are frequently volatile and can change abruptly and unpredictably in response to general economic conditions and
trends, government actions, regulatory actions, commodity inventories, production and consumption levels, technological
innovations, commodity substitutions, market expectations and any disruptions in production or distribution or changes in
consumption.  Economic conditions affecting the industries we serve may in the future also lead to reduced capital expenditures by
our customers. Reduced capital expenditures by our customers are likely to lead to a decrease in the demand for our products and
services and may also result in a decrease in demand for aftermarket parts as customers are likely to extend preventative
maintenance schedules and delay major overhauls when possible.
 
The rates of infrastructure spending, commercial construction and housing starts also play a significant role in our results.  Our
products are an integral component of these activities, and as these activities decrease, demand for our products may be
significantly impacted, which could negatively impact our results.  
Commodity price changes, material price increases, fluctuations in demand for our products, significant disruptions to our
supply chains or significant shortages of material may adversely impact our financial results or our ability to meet
commitments to customers.
 
We are a significant user of steel and many other commodities required for the manufacture of our products. Increases in the prices
of such commodities would increase our costs, negatively impacting our business, results of operations and financial condition if
we are unable to fully offset the effect of these increased costs through price increases, productivity improvements or cost reduction
programs.
 
9
Table of Contents
We rely on suppliers to produce or secure material required for the manufacture of our products. Production challenges at suppliers,
a disruption in deliveries to or from suppliers or decreased availability of raw materials or commodities could have an adverse
effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers or increase our operating costs.  On the other hand, in circumstances
where demand for our products is less than we expect, we may experience excess inventories and be forced to incur additional costs
and our profitability may suffer. Our business, competitive position, results of operations or financial condition could be negatively
impacted if supply is insufficient for our operations, if we experience excess inventories or if we are unable to adjust our production
schedules or our purchases from suppliers to reflect changes in customer demand and market fluctuations on a timely basis.
Changes in government monetary or fiscal policies may negatively impact our results.
 
Most countries where our products and services are sold have established central banks to regulate monetary systems and influence
economic activities, generally by adjusting interest rates. Interest rate changes affect overall economic growth, which affects
demand for residential and nonresidential structures, as well as energy and mined products, which in turn affects sales of our
products and services that support these activities.  Interest rate changes may also affect our customers’ ability to finance machine
purchases, can change the optimal time to keep machines in a fleet and can impact the ability of our suppliers to finance the
production of parts and components necessary to manufacture and support our products. Increases in interest rates could negatively
impact sales and create supply chain inefficiencies.
 
Central banks and other policy arms of many countries may take actions to vary the amount of liquidity and credit available in an
economy. The impact from a change in liquidity and credit policies could negatively affect the customers and markets we serve or
our suppliers, create supply chain inefficiencies and could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial
condition.
Changes in monetary and fiscal policies, along with other factors, may cause currency exchange rates to fluctuate. Actions that lead
the currency exchange rate of a country where we manufacture products to increase relative to other currencies could reduce the
competitiveness of products made in that country, which could adversely affect our competitive position, results of operations and
financial condition.
Government policies on taxes and spending also affect our business.  Throughout the world, government spending finances a
significant portion of infrastructure development, such as highways, rail systems, airports, sewer and water systems, waterways and
dams.  Tax regulations determine asset depreciation lives and impact the after-tax returns on business activity and investment, both
of which influence investment decisions.  Unfavorable developments, such as decisions to reduce public spending or to increase
taxes, could negatively impact our results.
Our global operations are exposed to political and economic risks, commercial instability and events beyond our control in
the countries in which we operate.
 
Our global operations are dependent upon products manufactured, purchased and sold in the U.S. and internationally, including in
countries with political and economic instability or uncertainty.  This includes, for example, the uncertainty related to the United
Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union (commonly known as “Brexit”). Some countries have greater political and
economic volatility and greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions than others.  Our business could be negatively
impacted by adverse fluctuations in freight costs, limitations on shipping and receiving capacity, and other disruptions in the
transportation and shipping infrastructure at important geographic points of exit and entry for our products. Operating in different
regions and countries exposes us to a number of risks, including:
•multiple and potentially conflicting laws, regulations and policies that are subject to change;
•imposition of currency restrictions, restrictions on repatriation of earnings or other restraints;
•imposition of new or additional tariffs or quotas;
•withdrawal from or modification of trade agreements or the negotiation of new trade agreements;
•imposition of new or additional trade and economic sanctions laws imposed by the U.S. or foreign governments;
•war or acts of terrorism; and
•political and economic instability or civil unrest that may severely disrupt economic activity in affected countries.

The occurrence of one or more of these events may negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.
 OPERATIONAL RISKS
The success of our business depends on our ability to develop, produce and market quality products that meet our
customers’ needs.
 
Our business relies on continued global demand for our brands and products.  To achieve business goals, we must develop and sell
products that appeal to our dealers, OEMs and end-user customers.  This is dependent on a number of factors, including our ability
to maintain key dealer relationships, our ability to produce products that meet the quality, performance and price expectations of
our customers and our ability to develop effective sales, advertising and marketing programs.  In addition, our continued success in
selling products that appeal to our customers is dependent on leading-edge innovation, with respect to both products and operations,
and on the availability and effectiveness of legal protection for our innovations.  Failure to continue to deliver high quality,
innovative, competitive products to the marketplace, to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, to supply products that
meet applicable regulatory requirements, including engine exhaust emission requirements or to predict market demands for, or gain
market acceptance of, our products, could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
We operate in a highly competitive environment, which could adversely affect our sales and pricing.
 
We operate in a highly competitive environment.  We compete on the basis of a variety of factors, including product performance,
customer service, quality and price.  There can be no assurance that our products will be able to compete successfully with other
companies’ products.  Thus, our share of industry sales could be reduced due to aggressive pricing or product strategies pursued by
competitors, unanticipated product or manufacturing difficulties, our failure to price our products competitively, our failure to
produce our products at a competitive cost or an unexpected buildup in competitors’ new machine or dealer-owned rental fleets,
which could lead to downward pressure on machine rental rates and/or used equipment prices.
 
Lack of customer acceptance of price increases we announce from time to time, changes in customer requirements for price
discounts, changes in our customers’ behavior or a weak pricing environment could have an adverse impact on our business, results
of operations and financial condition.
 
In addition, our results and ability to compete may be impacted negatively by changes in our geographic and product mix of sales.  
Increased information technology security threats and more sophisticated computer crime pose a risk to our systems,
networks, products and services.
We rely upon information technology systems and networks, some of which are managed by third parties, in connection with a
variety of business activities. Additionally, we collect and store sensitive information relating to our business, customers, dealers,
suppliers and employees. Operating these information technology systems and networks and processing and maintaining this data
in a secure manner, is critical to our business operations and strategy. Information technology security threats -- from user error to
cybersecurity attacks designed to gain unauthorized access to our systems, networks and data -- are increasing in frequency and
sophistication. Cybersecurity attacks may range from random attempts to coordinated and targeted attacks, including sophisticated
computer crime and advanced persistent threats. These threats pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the
confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. Cybersecurity attacks could also include attacks targeting customer data or the
security, integrity and/or reliability of the hardware and software installed in our products. It is possible that our information
technology systems and networks, or those managed by third parties, could have vulnerabilities, which could go unnoticed for a
period of time. While various procedures and controls have been and are being utilized to mitigate such risks, there can be no
guarantee that the actions and controls we have implemented and are implementing, or which we cause or have caused third party
service providers to implement, will be sufficient to protect our systems, information or other property.
11
Table of Contents
We have experienced cyber security threats and vulnerabilities in our systems and those of our third party providers, and we have
experienced viruses and attacks targeting our information technology systems and networks. Such prior events, to date, have not
had a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. However, the potential consequences of a future
material cybersecurity attack include reputational damage, litigation with third parties, government enforcement actions, penalties,
disruption to systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information, corruption of data, diminution in the
value of our investment in research, development and engineering, and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs,
which in turn could adversely affect our competitiveness, results of operations and financial condition. Due to the evolving nature
of such security threats, the potential impact of any future incident cannot be predicted. Further, the amount of insurance coverage
we maintain may be inadequate to cover claims or liabilities relating to a cybersecurity attack.
In addition, data we collect, store and process is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws and regulations, such as the
European Union's General Data Protection Regulation that became effective in May 2018, which may carry significant potential
penalties for noncompliance.
Our business is subject to the inventory management decisions and sourcing practices of our dealers and our OEM
customers.
 
We sell finished products primarily through an independent dealer network and directly to OEMs and are subject to risks relating to
their inventory management decisions and operational and sourcing practices.  Both carry inventories of finished products as part of
ongoing operations and adjust those inventories based on their assessments of future needs and market conditions, including levels
of used equipment inventory and machine rental usage rates.  Such adjustments may impact our results positively or negatively.  If
the inventory levels of our dealers and OEM customers are higher than they desire, they may postpone product purchases from us,
which could cause our sales to be lower than the end-user demand for our products and negatively impact our results. Similarly, our
results could be negatively impacted through the loss of time-sensitive sales if our dealers and OEM customers do not maintain
inventory levels sufficient to meet customer demand.
We may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions, joint ventures or divestitures, or these benefits may
take longer to realize than expected.
In pursuing our business strategy, we routinely evaluate targets and enter into agreements regarding possible acquisitions,
divestitures and joint ventures. We often compete with others for the same opportunities. To be successful, we conduct due
diligence to identify valuation issues and potential loss contingencies, negotiate transaction terms, complete complex transactions
and manage post-closing matters such as the integration of acquired businesses. Further, while we seek to mitigate risks and
liabilities of such transactions through due diligence, among other things, there may be risks and liabilities that our due diligence
efforts fail to discover, that are not accurately or completely disclosed to us or that we inadequately assess. We may incur
unanticipated costs or expenses following a completed acquisition, including post-closing asset impairment charges, expenses
associated with eliminating duplicate facilities, litigation, and other liabilities. Risks associated with our past or future acquisitions
also include the following:
•the failure to achieve the acquisition's revenue or profit forecast;
•the business culture of the acquired business may not match well with our culture;
•technological and product synergies, economies of scale and cost reductions may not occur as expected;
•unforeseen expenses, delays or conditions may be imposed upon the acquisition, including due to required regulatory
approvals or consents;
•we may acquire or assume unexpected liabilities or be subject to unexpected penalties or other enforcement actions;
•faulty assumptions may be made regarding the macroeconomic environment or the integration process;
•unforeseen difficulties may arise in integrating operations, processes and systems;
•higher than expected investments may be required to implement necessary compliance processes and related systems,
including information technology systems, accounting systems and internal controls over financial reporting;
•we may fail to retain, motivate and integrate key management and other employees of the acquired business;
•higher than expected costs may arise due to unforeseen changes in tax, trade, environmental, labor, safety, payroll or
pension policies in any jurisdiction in which the acquired business conducts its operations; and
12
Table of Contents
•we may experience problems in retaining customers and integrating customer bases.
Many of these factors will be outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of
expected revenues and diversion of management’s time and attention. They may also delay the realization of the benefits we
anticipate when we enter into a transaction.
 
In order to conserve cash for operations, we may undertake acquisitions financed in part through public offerings or private
placements of debt or equity securities, or other arrangements.  Such acquisition financing could result in a decrease in our earnings
and adversely affect other leverage measures.  If we issue equity securities or equity-linked securities, the issued securities may
have a dilutive effect on the interests of the holders of our common shares.
 
Failure to implement our acquisition strategy, including successfully integrating acquired businesses, could have an adverse effect
on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  Furthermore, we make strategic divestitures from time to time. In the
case of divestitures, we may agree to indemnify acquiring parties for certain liabilities arising from our former businesses. These
divestitures may also result in continued financial involvement in the divested businesses following the transaction, including
through guarantees or other financial arrangements.  Lower performance by those divested businesses could affect our future
financial results.
Union disputes or other labor matters could adversely affect our operations and financial results.
 
Some of our employees are represented by labor unions in a number of countries under various collective bargaining agreements
with varying durations and expiration dates.  There can be no assurance that any current or future issues with our employees will be
resolved or that we will not encounter future strikes, work stoppages or other disputes with labor unions or our employees.  We may
not be able to satisfactorily renegotiate collective bargaining agreements in the United States and other countries when they expire. 
If we fail to renegotiate our existing collective bargaining agreements, we could encounter strikes or work stoppages or other
disputes with labor unions.  In addition, existing collective bargaining agreements may not prevent a strike or work stoppage at our
facilities in the future.  We may also be subject to general country strikes or work stoppages unrelated to our business or collective
bargaining agreements. A work stoppage or other limitations on production at our facilities for any reason could have an adverse
effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, many of our customers and suppliers have
unionized work forces. Strikes or work stoppages experienced by our customers or suppliers could have an adverse effect on our
business, results of operations and financial condition.
Unexpected events may increase our cost of doing business or disrupt our operations.
 
The occurrence of one or more unexpected events, including war, acts of terrorism or violence, civil unrest, fires, tornadoes,
tsunamis, hurricanes, earthquakes, floods and other forms of severe weather in the United States or in other countries in which we
operate or in which our suppliers are located could adversely affect our operations and financial performance.  Natural disasters,
pandemic illness, including the current COVID-19 outbreak, equipment failures, power outages or other unexpected events could
result in physical damage to and complete or partial closure of one or more of our manufacturing facilities or distribution centers,
temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of component products from some local and international suppliers, and disruption
and delay in the transport of our products to dealers, end-users and distribution centers.  Existing insurance coverage may not
provide protection for all of the costs that may arise from such events.
FINANCIAL RISKS
Disruptions or volatility in global financial markets could limit our sources of liquidity, or the liquidity of our customers,
dealers and suppliers.
 
Continuing to meet our cash requirements over the long-term requires substantial liquidity and access to varied sources of funds,
including capital and credit markets. Global economic conditions may cause volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit
markets. Market volatility, changes in counterparty credit risk, the impact of government intervention in financial markets and
general economic conditions may also adversely impact our ability to access capital and credit markets to fund operating needs. 
Global or regional economic downturns could cause financial markets to decrease the availability of liquidity, credit and credit
capacity for certain issuers, including certain customers, dealers and suppliers. An inability to access capital and credit markets may
have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and competitive position. Furthermore, changes in
global economic conditions, including material cost increases and decreases in economic activity in key markets we serve, and the
success of plans to manage cost increases, inventory and other important elements of our business may significantly impact our
ability to generate funds from operations. 
13
Table of Contents
 
In addition, demand for our products generally depends on customers’ ability to pay for our products, which, in turn, depends on
their access to funds. Changes in global economic conditions may result in customers experiencing increased difficulty in
generating funds from operations. Capital and credit market volatility and uncertainty may cause financial institutions to revise
their lending standards, resulting in customers’ decreased access to capital. If capital and credit market volatility occurs, customers’
liquidity may decline which, in turn, would reduce their ability to purchase our products.
Failure to maintain our credit ratings would increase our cost of borrowing and could adversely affect our cost of funds,
liquidity, competitive position and access to capital markets.
 
Each of Caterpillar’s and Cat Financial’s costs of borrowing and their respective ability to access the capital markets are affected
not only by market conditions but also by the short- and long-term credit ratings assigned to their respective debt by the major
credit rating agencies.  These ratings are based, in significant part, on each of Caterpillar’s and Cat Financial’s performance as
measured by financial metrics such as net worth, interest coverage and leverage ratios, as well as transparency with rating agencies
and timeliness of financial reporting.  There can be no assurance that Caterpillar and Cat Financial will be able to maintain their
credit ratings. We receive debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies.  Moody’s
long- and short-term ratings of Caterpillar and Cat Financial are A3 and Prime-2 (“low-A”), while other major credit rating
agencies maintain a “mid-A” debt rating. A downgrade of our credit rating by any of the major credit rating agencies would result
in increased borrowing costs and could adversely affect Caterpillar’s and Cat Financial’s liquidity, competitive position and access
to the capital markets, including restricting, in whole or in part, access to the commercial paper market.  There can be no assurance
that the commercial paper market will continue to be a reliable source of short-term financing for Cat Financial or an available
source of short-term financing for Caterpillar. An inability to access the capital markets could have an adverse effect on our cash
flow, results of operations and financial condition.
 
Our Financial Products segment is subject to risks associated with the financial services industry.
 
Cat Financial is significant to our operations and provides financing support for a significant share of our global sales. The inability
of Cat Financial to access funds to support its financing activities to our customers could have an adverse effect on our business,
results of operations and financial condition.
Continuing to meet Cat Financial's cash requirements over the long-term could require substantial liquidity and access to sources of
funds, including capital and credit markets. Cat Financial has continued to maintain access to key global medium term note and
commercial paper markets, but there can be no assurance that such markets will continue to represent a reliable source of financing.
If global economic conditions were to deteriorate, Cat Financial could face materially higher financing costs, become unable to
access adequate funding to operate and grow its business and/or meet its debt service obligations as they mature, and be required to
draw upon contractually committed lending agreements and/or seek other funding sources. However, there can be no assurance that
such agreements and other funding sources would be available or sufficient under extreme market conditions.  Any of these events
could negatively impact Cat Financial’s business, as well as our and Cat Financial's results of operations and financial condition.
 
Market disruption and volatility may also lead to a number of other risks in connection with these events, including but not limited
to:
•Market developments that may affect customer confidence levels and cause declines in the demand for financing and
adverse changes in payment patterns, causing increases in delinquencies and default rates, which could impact Cat
Financial’s write-offs and provision for credit losses.
•The process Cat Financial uses to estimate losses inherent in its credit exposure requires a high degree of management’s
judgment regarding numerous subjective qualitative factors, including forecasts of economic conditions and how
economic predictors might impair the ability of its borrowers to repay their loans.  Financial market disruption and
volatility may impact the accuracy of these judgments.
•Cat Financial’s ability to engage in routine funding transactions or borrow from other financial institutions on acceptable
terms or at all could be adversely affected by disruptions in the capital markets or other events, including actions by rating
agencies and deteriorating investor expectations.
•As Cat Financial’s lending agreements are primarily with financial institutions, their ability to perform in accordance with
any of its underlying agreements could be adversely affected by market volatility and/or disruptions in financial markets.

Table of Contents
Changes in interest rates or market liquidity conditions could adversely affect Cat Financial's and our earnings and/or cash
flow.
Changes in interest rates and market liquidity conditions could have an adverse impact on Cat Financial's and our earnings and cash
flows. Because a significant number of the loans made by Cat Financial are made at fixed interest rates, its business results are
subject to fluctuations in interest rates. Certain loans made by Cat Financial and various financing extended to Cat Financial are
made at variable rates that use LIBOR as a benchmark for establishing the interest rate.  LIBOR is the subject of recent proposals
for reform.  On July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority announced that it intends to stop persuading or
compelling banks to submit LIBOR rates after 2021.  These reforms may cause LIBOR to cease to exist, new methods of
calculating LIBOR to be established such that LIBOR continues to exist after 2021 or the establishment of an alternative reference
rate(s).  Several offerings of securities that include such an alternative reference rate have now been completed by other companies.
The consequences of these developments cannot be entirely predicted and could have an adverse impact on the market value for or
value of LIBOR-linked securities, loans, derivatives, and other financial obligations or extensions of credit held by or due to Cat
Financial, as well as the revenue and expenses associated with those securities, loans and financial instruments. Cat Financial has
created a cross-functional team that will assess risk across multiple categories as it relates to the use of LIBOR in securities, loans,
derivatives, and other financial obligations or extensions of credit held by or due to us. The team is also closely monitoring the
progress of LIBOR reform and preparing to incorporate appropriate fallback language for transitioning to an alternative reference
rate(s) into new agreements with customers. The team is reviewing how to best manage those customer agreements that extend
beyond 2021 and utilize LIBOR.  Other changes in market interest rates may influence Cat Financial’s borrowing costs and could
reduce its and our earnings and cash flows, returns on financial investments and the valuation of derivative contracts. Cat Financial
manages interest rate and market liquidity risks through a variety of techniques that include a match funding strategy, the selective
use of derivatives and a broadly diversified funding program. There can be no assurance, however, that fluctuations in interest rates
and market liquidity conditions will not have an adverse impact on its and our earnings and cash flows. If any of the variety of
instruments and strategies Cat Financial uses to hedge its exposure to these types of risk is ineffective, this may have an adverse
impact on our earnings and cash flows.  With respect to Insurance Services' investment activities, changes in the equity and bond
markets could result in a decline in value of its investment portfolio, resulting in an unfavorable impact to earnings.
An increase in delinquencies, repossessions or net losses of Cat Financial customers could adversely affect its results.
 
Inherent in the operation of Cat Financial is the credit risk associated with its customers. The creditworthiness of each customer and
the rate of delinquencies, repossessions and net losses on customer obligations are directly impacted by several factors, including
relevant industry and economic conditions, the availability of capital, the experience and expertise of the customer's management
team, commodity prices, political events and the sustained value of the underlying collateral. Any increase in delinquencies,
repossessions and net losses on customer obligations could have a material adverse effect on Cat Financial's and our earnings and
cash flows. In addition, although Cat Financial evaluates and adjusts its allowance for credit losses related to past due and non-
performing receivables on a regular basis, adverse economic conditions or other factors that might cause deterioration of the
financial health of its customers could change the timing and level of payments received and necessitate an increase in Cat
Financial's estimated losses, which could also have a material adverse effect on Cat Financial's and our earnings and cash flows.
Currency exchange rate fluctuations affect our results of operations.
 
We conduct operations in many countries involving transactions denominated in a variety of currencies.  We are subject to currency
exchange rate risk to the extent that our costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which we earn revenues. 
Fluctuations in currency exchange rates have had, and will continue to have, an impact on our results as expressed in U.S. dollars. 
There can be no assurance that currency exchange rate fluctuations will not adversely affect our results of operations, financial
condition and cash flows. While the use of currency hedging instruments may provide us with protection from adverse fluctuations
in currency exchange rates, by utilizing these instruments we potentially forego the benefits that might result from favorable
fluctuations in currency exchange rates. In addition, our outlooks do not assume fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Adverse
fluctuations in currency exchange rates from the date of our outlooks could cause our actual results to differ materially from those
anticipated in our outlooks and adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.
 
We also face risks arising from the imposition of exchange controls and currency devaluations. Exchange controls may limit our
ability to convert foreign currencies into U.S. dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries or
businesses located in or conducted within a country imposing controls. Currency devaluations result in a diminished value of funds
denominated in the currency of the country instituting the devaluation.

Restrictive covenants in our debt agreements could limit our financial and operating flexibility.
 
We maintain a number of credit facilities to support general corporate purposes (facilities) and have issued debt securities to
manage liquidity and fund operations (debt securities).  The agreements relating to a number of the facilities and the debt securities
contain certain restrictive covenants applicable to us and certain subsidiaries, including Cat Financial.  These covenants include
maintaining a minimum consolidated net worth (defined as the consolidated shareholder’s equity including preferred stock but
excluding the pension and other post-retirement benefits balance within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)),
limitations on the incurrence of liens and certain restrictions on consolidation and merger. Cat Financial has also agreed under
certain of these agreements not to exceed a certain leverage ratio (consolidated debt to consolidated net worth, calculated (1) on a
monthly basis as the average of the leverage ratios determined on the last day of each of the six preceding calendar months and
(2) at each December 31), to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio (profit excluding income taxes, interest expense and net
gain/(loss) from interest rate derivatives to interest expense, calculated at the end of each calendar quarter for the rolling four
quarter period then most recently ended) and not to terminate, amend or modify its support agreement with us.
 
A breach of one or more of the covenants could result in adverse consequences that could negatively impact our business, results of
operations and financial condition. These consequences may include the acceleration of amounts outstanding under certain of the
facilities, triggering of an obligation to redeem certain debt securities, termination of existing unused commitments by our lenders,
refusal by our lenders to extend further credit under one or more of the facilities or to enter into new facilities or the lowering or
modification of our credit ratings or those of one or more of our subsidiaries.
 
Sustained increases in funding obligations under our pension plans may impair our liquidity or financial condition.
 
We maintain certain defined benefit pension plans for our employees, which impose on us certain funding obligations. In
determining our future payment obligations under the plans, we assume certain rates of return on the plan assets and a certain level
of future benefit payments. Significant adverse changes in credit or capital markets could result in actual rates of return being
materially lower than projected and result in increased contribution requirements.  Our assumptions for future benefit payments
may also change over time and could be materially higher than originally projected. We expect to make contributions to our
pension plans in the future, and may be required to make contributions that could be material.  We may fund contributions through
the use of cash on hand, the proceeds of borrowings, shares of our common stock or a combination of the foregoing, as permitted
by applicable law. Our assumptions for future benefit payments may change over time and could be materially higher than
projected.  These factors could significantly increase our payment obligations under the plans, and as a result, adversely affect our
business and overall financial condition.
LEGAL & REGULATORY RISKS
Our global operations are subject to a wide-range of trade and anti-corruption laws and regulations.
 
Due to the international scope of our operations, we are subject to a complex system of import- and export-related laws and
regulations, including U.S. regulations issued by Customs and Border Protection, the Bureau of Industry and Security, the Office of
Antiboycott Compliance, the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls and the Office of Foreign Assets Control, as well as the
counterparts of these agencies in other countries.  Any alleged or actual violations may subject us to increased government scrutiny,
investigation and civil and criminal penalties, and may limit our ability to import or export our products or to provide services
outside the United States.  Furthermore, embargoes and sanctions imposed by the U.S. and other governments restricting or
prohibiting sales to specific persons or countries or based on product classification may expose us to potential criminal and civil
sanctions. We cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our operations might be subject
or in certain locations the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted.
 
In addition, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar foreign anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their
intermediaries from making improper payments or providing anything of value to improperly influence foreign government
officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, or obtaining an unfair advantage. Recent years have seen a substantial
increase in the global enforcement of anti-corruption laws.  Our operations outside the United States, including in developing
countries, expose us to the the risk of such violations. Violations of anti-corruption laws or regulations by our employees,
intermediaries acting on our behalf, or our joint venture partners may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, could disrupt our
business, and result in an adverse effect on our reputation, business and results of operations or financial condition.

Table of Contents
International trade policies may impact demand for our products and our competitive position.
 
Government policies on international trade and investment such as import quotas, capital controls or tariffs, whether adopted by
individual governments or addressed by regional trade blocs, can affect the demand for our products and services, impact the
competitive position of our products or prevent us from being able to sell products in certain countries.  The implementation of
more restrictive trade policies, such as more detailed inspections, higher tariffs or new barriers to entry, in countries where we sell
large quantities of products and services could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.  For
example, a government’s adoption of “buy national” policies or retaliation by another government against such policies could have
a negative impact on our results of operations.
We may incur additional tax expense or become subject to additional tax exposure.
 
We are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous other jurisdictions. Our future results of operations could be
adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings between U.S. and non-U.S.
jurisdictions or among jurisdictions with differing statutory tax rates, changes in our overall profitability, changes in tax laws or
treaties or in their application or interpretation, changes in tax rates, changes in generally accepted accounting principles, changes
in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in the amount of earnings indefinitely reinvested in certain non-U.S.
jurisdictions, the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures.
We are also subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax
authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations. If our effective tax rates
were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our
operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected. For information regarding additional legal matters
related to our taxes, please see Note 6 — “Income taxes” and Note 22 — “Environmental and legal matters” of Part II, Item 8
“Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Costs associated with lawsuits or investigations or adverse rulings in enforcement or other legal proceedings may have an
adverse effect on our results of operations.
 
We are subject to a variety of legal proceedings and legal compliance risks in virtually every part of the world. We face risk of
exposure to various types of claims, lawsuits and government investigations. We are involved in various claims and lawsuits related
to product design, manufacture and performance liability (including claimed asbestos exposure), contracts, employment issues,
environmental matters, intellectual property rights, tax, securities and other legal proceedings that arise in and outside of the
ordinary course of our business.  The industries in which we operate are also periodically reviewed or investigated by regulators,
which could lead to enforcement actions, fines and penalties or the assertion of private litigation claims.  It is not possible to predict
with certainty the outcome of claims, investigations and lawsuits, and we could in the future incur judgments, fines or penalties or
enter into settlements of lawsuits and claims that could have an adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations or
financial condition in any particular period. 
The global and diverse nature of our operations means that legal and compliance risks will continue to exist and additional legal
proceedings and other contingencies, the outcome of which cannot be predicted with certainty, may arise from time to time. In
addition, subsequent developments in legal proceedings may affect our assessment and estimates of loss contingencies recorded as
a reserve and require us to make payments in excess of our reserves, which could have an adverse effect on our reputation, business
and results of operations or financial condition.
New regulations or changes in financial services regulation could adversely impact Caterpillar and Cat Financial.
 
Cat Financial’s operations are highly regulated by governmental authorities in the locations where it operates, which can impose
significant additional costs and/or restrictions on its business. In the United States, for example, certain Cat Financial activities are
subject to the U.S. Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank), which includes extensive
provisions regulating the financial services industry. As a result, Cat Financial has become and could continue to become subject to
additional regulatory costs that could be significant and have an adverse effect on Cat Financial’s and our results of operations and
financial condition. Changes in regulations or additional regulations in the United States or internationally impacting the financial
services industry could also add significant cost or operational constraints that might have an adverse effect on Cat Financial’s and
our results of operations and financial condition.

Table of Contents
We are subject to stringent environmental laws and regulations that impose significant compliance costs.
 
Our facilities, operations and products are subject to increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations globally, including
laws and regulations governing emissions to noise, air, releases to soil and discharges to water and the generation, handling,
storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of non-hazardous and hazardous waste materials. Some environmental laws impose
strict, retroactive and joint and several liability for the remediation of the release of hazardous substances, even for conduct that
was lawful at the time it occurred, or for the conduct of, or conditions caused by, prior operators, predecessors or other third parties.
Failure to comply with environmental laws could expose us to penalties or clean-up costs, civil or criminal liability and sanctions
on certain of our activities, as well as damage to property or natural resources. The potential liabilities, sanctions, damages and
remediation efforts related to any non-compliance with such laws and regulations could negatively impact our ability to conduct
our operations and our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, there can be no assurances that we will not be
adversely affected by costs, liabilities or claims with respect to existing or subsequently acquired operations or under present laws
and regulations or those that may be adopted or imposed in the future.
Environmental laws and regulations may change from time to time, as may related interpretations and other guidance. Changes in
environmental laws or regulations could result in higher expenses and payments, and uncertainty relating to environmental laws or
regulations may also affect how we conduct our operations and structure our investments and could limit our ability to enforce our
rights. Changes in environmental and climate change laws or regulations, including laws relating to greenhouse gas emissions,
could lead to new or additional investment in product designs and could increase environmental compliance expenditures. Changes
in climate change concerns, or in the regulation of such concerns, including greenhouse gas emissions, could subject us to
additional costs and restrictions, including increased energy and raw materials costs. If environmental laws or regulations are either
changed or adopted and impose significant operational restrictions and compliance requirements upon us or our products, they
could negatively impact our reputation, business, capital expenditures, results of operations, financial condition and competitive
position.

General Information
Caterpillar’s operations are highly integrated.  Although the majority of our plants are involved primarily in production relating to
our Construction Industries, Resource Industries or Energy & Transportation segments, several plants are involved in
manufacturing relating to more than one business segment.  In addition, several plants reported in our financial statements under
the All Other segment are involved in the manufacturing of components that are used in the assembly of products for more than one
business segment.  Caterpillar’s parts distribution centers are involved in the storage and distribution of parts for Construction

Item 7.Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
 
This Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with
our discussion of cautionary statements and significant risks to the company’s business under Item 1A. Risk Factors of the 2019
Form 10-K.
OVERVIEW
Our sales and revenues for 2019 were $53.800 billion, a 2 percent decrease from 2018 sales and revenues of $54.722 billion. The
decrease was primarily due to lower sales volume. The sales volume decline was mostly due to changes in dealer inventories,
partially offset by higher end-user demand. Sales were lower in EAME and Asia/Pacific, while North America and Latin America
were about flat. Sales declined in Energy & Transportation and Construction Industries, while Resource Industries was about
flat. Profit per share for 2019 was $10.74, compared to profit per share of $10.26 in 2018. Profit was $6.093 billion in 2019,
compared with $6.147 billion in 2018. The decrease was primarily due to higher tax expense as operating profit was about flat.
Operating profit was about flat as favorable price realization, lower selling, general and administrative (SG&A) and research and
development (R&D) expenses and higher Financial Products’ profit were offset by higher manufacturing costs, lower sales volume
and unfavorable currency impacts.
Fourth-quarter 2019 sales and revenues were $13.144 billion, down $1.198 billion, or 8 percent, from $14.342 billion in the fourth
quarter of 2018. Fourth-quarter 2019 profit was $1.97 per share, compared with $1.78 per share in the fourth quarter of 2018.
Fourth-quarter 2019 profit was $1.098 billion, compared with $1.048 billion in 2018.
Highlights for 2019 include:
•Sales and revenues in 2019 were $53.800 billion, down 2 percent from 2018. Sales declined in Energy & Transportation and
Construction Industries, while Resource Industries was about flat.
•Operating profit as a percent of sales and revenues was 15.4 percent in 2019, compared with 15.2 percent in 2018.
•Profit was $10.74 per share for 2019, and excluding the items in the table below, adjusted profit per share was $11.06. For
2018 profit was $10.26 per share, and excluding the items in the table below, adjusted profit per share was $11.22.

2019 COMPARED WITH 2018
CONSOLIDATED SALES AND REVENUES
The chart above graphically illustrates reasons for the change in consolidated sales and revenues between 2018 (at left) and 2019 (at right). Caterpillar management
utilizes these charts internally to visually communicate with the company’s Board of Directors and employees.
Total sales and revenues were $53.800 billion in 2019, a decrease of $922 million, or 2 percent, compared with $54.722 billion in
2018. The decrease was mostly due to lower sales volume driven by changes in dealer inventories, partially offset by higher end-
user demand. Unfavorable currency impacts, primarily from a weaker euro, Australian dollar, Chinese yuan and Brazilian real,
were mostly offset by favorable price realization. Sales decreased in Energy & Transportation and Construction Industries, while
Resource Industries was about flat. Sales decreased in EAME and Asia/Pacific, while North America and Latin America were about
flat.
North America sales were about flat compared with prior year as favorable price realization was mostly offset by lower sales
volume. Sales volume declined primarily due to changes in dealer inventories as dealers increased inventories more during 2018
than 2019, partially offset by higher end-user demand.
Sales were about flat in Latin America as higher sales volume was offset by an unfavorable currency impact from a weaker
Brazilian real. Sales volume increased due to higher end-user demand which was mostly offset by changes in dealer inventories as
dealers increased inventories more during 2018 than 2019.
EAME sales decreased 6 percent primarily due to lower sales volume and the unfavorable impact of a weaker euro, partially offset
by higher price realization. The decrease in sales volume was primarily due to changes in dealer inventories. Dealers increased
inventories during 2018 and decreased inventories during 2019.
Asia/Pacific sales declined 4 percent primarily due to unfavorable currency impacts of a weaker Australian dollar and Chinese yuan
and lower sales volume. Sales volume decreased due to changes in dealer inventories, partially offset by higher end-user demand.
Dealer inventories increased more during 2018 than 2019.
Dealer machine and engine inventories increased about $2.3 billion in 2018, compared with an increase of about $800 million in
2019. Dealers are independent, and the reasons for changes in their inventory levels vary, including their expectations of future
demand and product delivery times. Dealers’ demand expectations take into account seasonal changes, macroeconomic conditions,
machine rental rates and other factors. Delivery times can vary based on availability of product from Caterpillar factories and
product distribution centers. We expect dealer inventories to decline about $1.0 to $1.5 billion during 2020.

CONSOLIDATED OPERATING PROFIT
The chart above graphically illustrates reasons for the change in consolidated operating profit between 2018 (at left) and 2019 (at right). Caterpillar management
utilizes these charts internally to visually communicate with the company’s Board of Directors and employees. The bar entitled Other includes consolidating
adjustments and Machinery, Energy & Transportation other operating (income) expenses.
Operating profit was $8.290 billion in 2019, about flat with $8.293 billion in 2018. Favorable price realization mostly offset higher
manufacturing costs. Lower sales volume offset favorable selling, general and administrative (SG&A) and research and
development (R&D) expenses and higher profit from Financial Products.
Manufacturing costs increased due to higher warranty expense, increased variable labor and burden, unfavorable cost absorption,
and higher material costs. Cost absorption was unfavorable as inventory increased during 2018, compared with a decrease during
2019. The increase was partially offset by lower period manufacturing costs driven by lower short-term incentive compensation
expense and the favorable impact of restructuring and cost-reduction actions.
SG&A/R&D expenses decreased due to lower short-term incentive compensation expense, partially offset by investments aligned
with the company’s strategic growth initiatives.
Short-term incentive compensation expense is directly related to financial and operational performance, measured against targets
set annually. Short-term incentive compensation expense in 2018 was about $1.4 billion, compared with about $700 million in
2019.
For 2020, we expect short-term incentive compensation expense will be about $800 million. We also expect lower manufacturing
costs.
Operating profit margin was 15.4 percent in 2019, compared with 15.2 percent in 2018.

Other Profit/Loss and Tax Items
•Interest expense excluding Financial Products in 2019 was $421 million, compared with $404 million in 2018. The
increase was due to higher average debt outstanding during 2019 than 2018.
•Other income (expense) in 2019 was expense of $57 million, compared with expense of $67 million in 2018. The decrease
was due to a lower expected return on pension and other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plan assets more than offset by
lower foreign exchange losses, unrealized and realized gains on marketable securities at Insurance Services and the
favorable impact of commodity hedges.
•The provision for income taxes for 2019 reflected an annual effective tax rate of 25.2 percent, compared with 24.1 percent
for 2018, excluding the discrete items discussed in the following paragraph. The increase from 2018 was largely driven by
the application of U.S. tax reform provisions to the earnings of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries, which do not have a calendar
fiscal year-end. These provisions did not apply to these subsidiaries in 2018.
The provision for income taxes also included the following:
◦A tax benefit of $178 million to adjust previously unrecognized tax benefits as a result of receipt of additional
guidance in 2019 related to the calculation of the mandatory deemed repatriation of non-U.S. earnings due to
U.S. tax reform. In 2018, the mandatory deemed repatriation estimate increased by $50 million.
◦A tax benefit of $41 million in 2019, compared with $56 million in 2018, for the settlement of stock-based
compensation awards with associated tax deductions in excess of cumulative U.S. GAAP compensation expense.
◦A net benefit of $183 million in 2018 to adjust deferred tax balances. (See Note – 6 “Income Taxes” of Part II,
Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for more information.)
Construction Industries
Construction Industries’ total sales were $22.649 billion for 2019, a decrease of $588 million, or 3 percent, compared with $23.237
billion for 2018. The decrease was primarily due to lower sales volume driven by changes in dealer inventories, partially offset by
higher end-user demand. Dealer inventories increased significantly more during 2018 than during 2019. Favorable price realization
was offset by unfavorable currency impacts from a weaker euro, Chinese yuan and Australian dollar.
Sales increased in North America and Latin America, and decreased in Asia/Pacific and EAME.
•In North America, the sales increase was primarily due to higher demand for construction equipment and favorable price
realization.
•Sales were higher in Latin America. While construction activities remained at low levels, the increase was driven by road and
non-residential construction activities.
•Sales decreased in EAME primarily due to changes in dealer inventories and the unfavorable impact of a weaker euro, partially
offset by favorable price realization. Dealer inventories increased during 2018, compared with a decrease during 2019.
30
Table of Contents
•Sales in Asia/Pacific decreased mostly due to lower demand, including changes in dealer inventories, and unfavorable currency
impacts. The unfavorable currency impacts were due to a weaker Chinese yuan and Australian dollar. Dealers increased
inventories during 2018 and decreased inventories during 2019. The lower demand was primarily in China due to continued
competitive pressures. In addition, demand was lower across the region.
Construction Industries’ profit was $3.931 billion in 2019, a decrease of $243 million, or 6 percent, compared with $4.174 billion in
2018. The decrease was primarily due to lower sales volume, including an unfavorable mix of products, and higher manufacturing
costs, which were partially offset by favorable price realization and lower SG&A/R&D expenses. Manufacturing costs increased
primarily due to unfavorable variable labor and burden. Lower SG&A/R&D expenses were due to lower short-term incentive
compensation expense, partially offset by investments aligned with the company’s strategic growth initiatives.
Construction Industries’ profit as a percent of total sales was 17.4 percent in 2019, compared with 18.0 percent in 2018.
Resource Industries
Resource Industries’ total sales were $10.276 billion in 2019, about flat with $10.270 billion in 2018. Higher end-user demand for
equipment and favorable price realization were offset by changes in dealer inventories and unfavorable currency impacts, primarily
the weaker Australian dollar and euro. Higher end-user demand was driven by increased capital investment by mining customers to
support ongoing mine site operations. End-user demand also increased for our non-residential construction and quarry and
aggregate customers. Dealers increased inventories more significantly during 2018 than during 2019.
Resource Industries’ profit was $1.629 billion in 2019, an increase of $26 million, or 2 percent, compared with $1.603 billion in
2018. The improvement was mostly due to favorable price realization, partially offset by higher manufacturing costs.
Manufacturing costs increased due to higher warranty expense, unfavorable cost absorption, increased variable labor and burden
and higher material costs, partially offset by the favorable period manufacturing costs due to the impact of restructuring and cost-
reduction actions and lower short-term incentive compensation expense. Cost absorption was unfavorable as inventory increased
more during 2018 than 2019.
Resource Industries’ profit as a percent of total sales was 15.9 percent in 2019, compared with 15.6 percent in 2018.

Energy & Transportation’s total sales were $22.097 billion in 2019, compared with $22.785 billion in 2018. Sales declined
primarily due to lower inter-segment engine sales and unfavorable currency impacts, primarily from the weaker euro and Australian
dollar.
▪Oil and Gas – Sales decreased in North America primarily due to lower new equipment demand for well servicing and the
timing of turbine project deliveries for gas compression and production. Lower sales in North America were partially
offset by increases in all other regions, primarily Asia/Pacific.
▪Power Generation – Sales increased mostly due to higher deliveries of diesel reciprocating engines in North America and
higher turbine sales across all regions. The increase was partially offset by lower diesel reciprocating engine sales in
EAME and Asia/Pacific driven by unfavorable currency impacts and lower volume.
▪Industrial – Sales improved primarily in North America and Asia/Pacific driven by higher end-user demand.
▪Transportation – Sales were about flat as lower locomotive sales were offset by stronger marine demand.
Energy & Transportation’s profit was $3.910 billion for 2019, a decrease of $28 million, or 1 percent, compared with $3.938 billion
for 2018. The decrease was mostly due to lower sales volumes, partially offset by lower SG&A/R&D expenses. Lower
SG&A/R&D expenses were primarily due to lower short-term incentive compensation expense. Higher manufacturing costs were
more than offset by favorable price realization and favorable other operating (income) expenses.

Table of Contents
Energy & Transportation’s profit as a percent of total sales was 17.7 percent in 2019, compared with 17.3 percent in 2018.
Financial Products Segment
Financial Products’ segment revenues were $3.434 billion, an increase of $155 million, or 5 percent, from 2018. The increase was
primarily due to higher average financing rates in North America and Asia/Pacific, an increase in earned premiums from Insurance
Services across all regions and higher average earning assets in North America. These favorable impacts were partially offset by
the absence of fees associated with an intercompany credit facility in North America.
Financial Products’ segment profit was $832 million in 2019, compared with $505 million in 2018. Most of the increase was due to
lower provision for credit losses at Cat Financial, driven by a lower allowance rate compared with 2018. The lower allowance rate
was due to write-offs of accounts in 2019 that were reserved for in 2018, primarily in the Cat Power Finance portfolio. In addition,
there was a favorable impact from an increase in net yield on average earning assets and a favorable impact from equity securities
in Insurance Services. These favorable impacts were partially offset by higher SG&A expenses and the absence of the
intercompany credit facility.
At the end of 2019, past dues at Cat Financial were 3.14 percent, compared with 3.55 percent at the end 2018. Write-offs, net of
recoveries, were $237 million for 2019, an increase from $189 million for 2018, primarily due to Mining, Caterpillar Power
Finance and EAME, partially offset by a decrease in Latin America. The increase in Mining was due to a small number of customer
balances written off in 2019, while the increases in Caterpillar Power Finance and EAME were concentrated in the marine portfolio
and the Middle East, respectively. As of December 31, 2019, Cat Financial’s allowance for credit losses totaled $424 million, or
1.50 percent of finance receivables, compared with $511 million, or 1.80 percent of finance receivables, at December 31, 2018.
Corporate Items and Eliminations
Expense for corporate items and eliminations was $1.585 billion in 2019, an increase of $19 million from 2018. The increase was
primarily due to methodology differences, mostly offset by lower restructuring costs and timing differences.

CONSOLIDATED SALES AND REVENUES
The chart above graphically illustrates reasons for the change in consolidated sales and revenues between the fourth quarter of 2018 (at left) and the fourth quarter of
2019 (at right). Caterpillar management utilizes these charts internally to visually communicate with the company’s Board of Directors and employees.
Total sales and revenues of $13.144 billion in the fourth quarter of 2019 decreased $1.198 billion, or 8 percent, compared with
$14.342 billion in the fourth quarter of 2018. The decline was due to lower sales volume driven by the impact from changes in
dealer inventories and lower end-user demand, primarily in Construction Industries and Resource Industries. Dealers decreased
machine and engine inventories about $700 million during the fourth quarter of 2019, compared with an increase of about $200
million during the fourth quarter of 2018.
The largest sales decrease was in North America, which declined 14 percent due to lower demand, including changes in dealer
inventories. Dealer inventories increased during the fourth quarter of 2018, compared with a decrease during the fourth quarter of
2019.
Sales decreased 16 percent in Latin America due to lower demand across the region.
EAME sales decreased 6 percent primarily due to changes in dealer inventories and unfavorable currency impacts, primarily from
the weaker euro. Dealer inventories decreased more during the fourth quarter of 2019 than the fourth quarter of 2018.
Asia/Pacific sales were about flat as higher sales volume was offset by unfavorable price realization and currency impacts,
primarily from the weaker Australian dollar. Sales volume was higher as improved end-user demand was partially offset by changes
in dealer inventories. Dealer inventories increased more during the fourth quarter of 2018 than the fourth quarter of 2019.
Dealers decreased machine and engine inventories about $700 million during the fourth quarter of 2019, compared with an increase
of about $200 million during the fourth quarter of 2018. Dealers are independent, and the reasons for changes in their inventory
levels vary, including their expectations of future demand and product delivery times. Dealers’ demand expectations take into
account seasonal changes, macroeconomic conditions, machine rental rates and other factors. Delivery times can vary based on
availability of product from Caterpillar factories and product distribution centers.

CONSOLIDATED OPERATING PROFIT
The chart above graphically illustrates reasons for the change in consolidated operating profit between the fourth quarter of 2018 (at left) and the fourth quarter of 2019 (at right).
Caterpillar management utilizes these charts internally to visually communicate with the company’s Board of Directors and employees. The bar entitled Other includes consolidating
adjustments and Machinery, Energy & Transportation other operating (income) expenses.
Operating profit for the fourth quarter of 2019 was $1.850 billion, a decrease of $33 million, or 2 percent, compared with $1.883
billion in the fourth quarter of 2018. The decrease was primarily due to lower sales volume, mostly offset by lower SG&A and
R&D expenses and higher profit from Financial Products.
Lower SG&A/R&D expenses were mostly due to a reduction in short-term incentive compensation expense and timing of R&D
expenses.
Financial Products’ operating profit was higher, primarily due to lower provisions for credit losses related to the Cat Power Finance
portfolio compared with the fourth quarter of 2018.
In addition, favorable manufacturing costs were mostly offset by unfavorable price realization. Manufacturing costs decreased
primarily due to lower period manufacturing and material costs, partially offset by higher warranty expense. Period manufacturing
costs declined mainly due to lower short-term incentive compensation and the favorable impact of restructuring and cost-reduction
actions.
Short-term incentive compensation expense was about $120 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, compared with about $310
million in the fourth quarter of 2018.
Operating profit margin in the fourth quarter of 2019 was 14.1 percent, compared with 13.1 percent in the fourth quarter of 2018.

Other Profit/Loss and Tax Items
•Interest expense excluding Financial Products in the fourth quarter of 2019 was $112 million, compared with $99 million in the
fourth quarter of 2018. The increase was due to higher average debt outstanding during the fourth quarter of 2019, compared
with the fourth quarter of 2018.
•Other income (expense) in the fourth quarter of 2019 was expense of $373 million, compared with expense of $417 million in
the fourth quarter of 2018. The decrease in expense was due to the favorable impact of commodity hedges, higher realized
gains and lower unrealized losses on marketable securities at Insurance Services, which were partially offset by unfavorable
pension and OPEB costs.
•The provision for income taxes in the fourth quarter reflected an annual effective tax rate of 25.2 percent, compared with 24.1
percent for the full year of 2018, excluding discrete items discussed in the following paragraph. The increase from 2018 was
largely driven by the application of U.S. tax reform provisions to the earnings of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries, which do not
have a calendar fiscal year-end. These provisions did not apply to these subsidiaries in 2018.
The provision for income taxes also included the following:
◦The change from the third-quarter estimated annual tax rate of 26 percent to the annual effective tax rate of 25.2
percent resulted in a $54 million tax benefit in the fourth quarter of 2019.
◦A tax benefit of $13 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, compared to $4 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, for the
settlement of stock-based compensation awards with associated tax deductions in excess of cumulative U.S. GAAP
compensation expense.
◦A net tax benefit of $13 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 for other discrete items.
Construction Industries
Construction Industries’ total sales were $5.020 billion in the fourth quarter of 2019, a decrease of $685 million, or 12 percent,
compared with $5.705 billion in the fourth quarter of 2018. The decrease was due to lower sales volume, driven mostly by the
impact from changes in dealer inventories. Dealers decreased inventories during the fourth quarter of 2019, compared with dealer
inventories that were about flat during the fourth quarter of 2018. Unfavorable price realization also contributed to the decline in
sales.
•In North America, sales decreased due to lower demand driven by the impact from changes in dealer inventories, while
end-user demand was about flat. Dealers decreased inventories during the fourth quarter of 2019, compared with an
increase during the fourth quarter of 2018.
•Sales were higher in Latin America. While construction activities remained at low levels, the increase was driven by road
and residential construction activities.
•In EAME, the sales decrease was primarily due to the impact from changes in dealer inventories and lower end-user
demand across most of the region. Dealers decreased inventories more during the fourth quarter of 2019 than during the
fourth quarter of 2018.

Table of Contents
•Sales in Asia/Pacific were about flat as unfavorable price realization was mostly offset by a few countries’ higher sales
volume.
Construction Industries’ profit was $659 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, a decrease of $186 million, or 22 percent, compared
with $845 million in the fourth quarter of 2018. The decrease was primarily due to lower sales volume.
In addition, favorable manufacturing costs were mostly offset by unfavorable price realization. Manufacturing costs decreased due
to lower period manufacturing and material costs. Period manufacturing costs declined mainly due to the favorable impact of
restructuring and cost-reduction actions as well as lower short-term incentive compensation.
Construction Industries’ profit as a percent of total sales was 13.1 percent in the fourth quarter of 2019, compared with 14.8 percent
in the fourth quarter of 2018.
Resource Industries
Resource Industries’ total sales were $2.395 billion in the fourth quarter of 2019, a decrease of $402 million, or 14 percent,
compared with $2.797 billion in the fourth quarter of 2018. The decrease was due to lower sales volume, driven by changes in
dealer inventories and lower end-user demand. Dealers increased inventories during the fourth quarter of 2018, compared with a
decrease during the fourth quarter of 2019. While commodity prices are generally supportive of reinvestment, the company
continues to believe mining customers remained disciplined in their capital expenditures due to economic uncertainty, resulting in
lower sales in the quarter. In addition, end-user demand decreased for equipment supporting non-residential construction.
Resource Industries’ profit was $261 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, a decrease of $139 million, or 35 percent, compared with
$400 million in the fourth quarter of 2018. The decrease was mainly due to lower sales volume, partially offset by lower
SG&A/R&D expenses and favorable price realization. The decrease in SG&A/R&D expenses reflected a reduction in short-term
incentive compensation expense and timing of R&D expenses.
Resource Industries’ profit as a percent of total sales was 10.9 percent in the fourth quarter of 2019, compared with 14.3 percent in
the fourth quarter of 2018.

Energy & Transportation’s total sales were $5.949 billion in the fourth quarter of 2019, a decrease of $338 million, or 5 percent,
compared with $6.287 billion in the fourth quarter of 2018. Sales declined primarily due to lower inter-segment engine sales and
unfavorable currency impacts.
•Oil and Gas - Sales were lower mainly in North America. The sales decline was largely due to lower demand for
reciprocating engines used in gas compression and lower turbine project deliveries.
•Power Generation - Sales increased slightly primarily due to higher deliveries for turbines in EAME.
•Industrial - Sales were about flat as slightly higher sales in North America were partially offset by lower sales in Latin
America and EAME.
•Transportation - Sales were higher mainly due to stronger marine demand in EAME.
Energy & Transportation’s profit was $1.165 billion in the fourth quarter of 2019, an increase of $86 million, or 8 percent,
compared with $1.079 billion in the fourth quarter of 2018. The increase was mostly due to lower SG&A/R&D expenses, primarily
due to a reduction in short-term incentive compensation expense and lower R&D project expenses. Lower manufacturing costs
were mostly offset by lower sales volume.

Financial Products Segment
Financial Products’ segment revenues were $846 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, an increase of $34 million, or 4 percent,
from the fourth quarter of 2018. The increase was primarily due to a favorable impact from returned or repossessed equipment in
Europe and higher average financing rates in North America.
Financial Products’ segment profit was $210 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, compared with $29 million in the fourth quarter
of 2018. Most of the increase was due to lower provision for credit losses at Cat Financial, driven by a lower allowance rate
compared with 2018. The lower allowance rate was due to write-offs of accounts in 2019 that were reserved for in 2018, primarily
in the Cat Power Finance portfolio. In addition, there was a favorable impact from equity securities in Insurance Services, as well
as favorable impacts from an increase in net yield on average earning assets and returned or repossessed equipment. These
favorable impacts were partially offset by higher SG&A expenses.
Corporate Items and Eliminations
Expense for corporate items and eliminations was $331 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, an increase of $10 million from the
fourth quarter of 2018. The increase was primarily due to methodology differences, offset by timing differences and lower
restructuring costs.

CONSOLIDATED SALES AND REVENUES
The chart above graphically illustrates reasons for the change in consolidated sales and revenues between 2017 (at left) and 2018 (at right). Caterpillar management
utilizes these charts internally to visually communicate with the company’s Board of Directors and employees.
Total sales and revenues were $54.722 billion in 2018, an increase of $9.260 billion, or 20 percent, compared with $45.462 billion
in 2017. The increase was primarily due to higher sales volume driven by improved demand for equipment across the three primary
segments, including changes in dealer inventories. Favorable price realization across the three primary segments also contributed to
the sales improvement. In addition, sales were higher due to currency impacts, primarily from a stronger euro. Financial Products’
revenues increased slightly.
Sales increased in all regions, with the largest sales increase in North America, which improved 23 percent as strong economic
conditions in key end markets drove higher demand. Also contributing to higher sales was an increase in dealer inventories during
2018, compared with dealer inventories that were about flat in 2017.
Sales increased 13 percent in Latin America primarily due to stabilizing economic conditions in several countries in the region that
resulted in improved demand from low levels.
EAME sales increased 16 percent primarily due to higher demand, including changes in dealer inventories. The improvement in
demand was primarily in Europe. The impact of a stronger euro and favorable price realization also contributed to higher sales.
Dealer inventories increased more significantly in 2018 than in 2017.

Table of Contents
Asia/Pacific sales increased 28 percent primarily due to higher demand in several countries across the region, including changes in
dealer inventories and favorable price realization. Dealer inventories increased during 2018 as compared with dealer inventories
that were about flat in 2017.
Dealer machine and engine inventories increased about $2.3 billion in 2018, compared with an increase of about $100 million in
2017. Dealers are independent, and the reasons for changes in their inventory levels vary, including their expectations of future
demand and product delivery times. Dealers’ demand expectations take into account seasonal changes, macroeconomic conditions,
machine rental rates and other factors. Delivery times can vary based on availability of product from Caterpillar factories and
product distribution centers.

CONSOLIDATED OPERATING PROFIT
The chart above graphically illustrates reasons for the change in consolidated operating profit between 2017 (at left) and 2018 (at right). Caterpillar management
utilizes these charts internally to visually communicate with the company’s Board of Directors and employees. The bar entitled Other includes consolidating
adjustments and Machinery, Energy & Transportation other operating (income) expenses.
Operating profit was $8.293 billion in 2018, an increase of $3.833 billion, or 86 percent, compared with $4.460 billion in 2017. The
increase was primarily due to higher sales volume and lower restructuring costs. Higher manufacturing costs and increased
SG&A/R&D expenses were mostly offset by favorable price realization.
Manufacturing costs were higher due to increased material and freight costs, partially offset by lower warranty expense. Material
costs were higher primarily due to increases in steel prices. The impact of tariffs on material costs was about $110 million during
2018. Freight costs were unfavorable primarily due to supply chain inefficiencies as the industry responds to strong global demand.
SG&A/R&D expenses increased primarily due to investments aligned with the company’s strategic growth initiatives.
Restructuring costs were $394 million in 2018, related to restructuring actions across the company. In 2017, we incurred $1.227
billion of restructuring costs with about half related to the closure of the facility in Gosselies, Belgium, and the remainder related to
other restructuring actions across the company.
Short-term incentive compensation expense is directly related to financial and operational performance, measured against targets
set annually. Short-term incentive compensation expense in 2018 was about $1.4 billion, nearly the same as 2017.

Other Profit/Loss and Tax Items
•Other income/expense in 2018 was expense of $67 million, compared with income of $153 million in 2017. The
unfavorable change was primarily a result of an unfavorable impact from equity securities in Insurance Services. Effective
January 1, 2018, we adopted a new U.S. GAAP accounting rule that requires our equity securities to be measured at fair
value through earnings. Previously, the fair value adjustments for these securities were reported in equity until the
securities were sold or an impairment was recognized. We adopted the standard using the modified retrospective approach,
with no change to prior year financial statements. During 2018, we recognized a loss of $33 million related to fair value
adjustments.  During 2017, we recognized gains on sales of securities of $104 million. In addition, the absence of a 2017
pretax gain of $85 million on the sale of Caterpillar’s equity investment in IronPlanet contributed to the unfavorable
change.
•The provision for income taxes for 2018 reflects an annual effective tax rate of 24.1 percent, compared with 27.7 percent
for the full year of 2017, excluding the items discussed below. The decrease was primarily due to the reduction in the U.S.
corporate tax rate beginning January 1, 2018, along with other changes in the geographic mix of profits from a tax
perspective.
We have completed our accounting for the income tax effects of U.S. tax reform legislation and included measurement
period adjustments in 2018 of $104 million to reduce the provisionally estimated charge of $2.371 billion recognized in
2017. A $154 million benefit revised the estimated impact of the write-down of U.S. net deferred tax assets to reflect the
reduction in the U.S. corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent. This benefit primarily related to the decision to
make an additional discretionary pension contribution of $1.0 billion to U.S. pension plans in 2018 which was treated as
deductible on the 2017 U.S. tax return. A $50 million charge revised the provisionally estimated cost of a mandatory
deemed repatriation of non-U.S. earnings, including changes in the deferred tax liability related to the amount of earnings
considered not indefinitely reinvested as well as the amount of unrecognized tax benefits and state tax liabilities associated
with these tax positions.
The provision for income taxes in 2018 and 2017 also included non-cash benefits of $63 million and $111 million,
respectively, from reductions in the valuation allowance against U.S. state deferred tax assets due to improved profits in
the United States. An additional benefit of $25 million was included in 2018 due to the release of a valuation allowance for
a certain non-U.S. subsidiary. The provision for income taxes in 2018 also included a charge of $59 million to correct for
an error which resulted in an understatement of the valuation allowance offsetting deferred tax assets for prior years. This
error had the effect of overstating profit by $17 million and $33 million for 2017 and 2016, respectively. Management has
concluded that the error was not material to any period presented.  In addition, a tax benefit of $56 million was recorded in
2018, compared with $64 million in 2017, for the settlement of stock-based compensation awards with associated tax
deductions in excess of cumulative U.S. GAAP compensation expense.
Construction Industries
Construction Industries’ total sales were $23.237 billion in 2018, compared with $19.240 billion in 2017. The increase was mostly
due to higher sales volume for construction equipment. Sales were also higher due to currency impacts, primarily from a stronger
euro.
▪Sales volume increased primarily due to higher demand for construction equipment and changes in dealer inventories.
Dealer inventories increased significantly more during 2018 than during 2017.
Sales increased in all regions.
▪In North America, the sales increase was primarily due to higher demand for construction equipment, primarily to support
oil and gas activities, including pipelines, non-residential building construction and infrastructure activities. In addition,
sales increased due to changes in dealer inventories, which increased during 2018, compared with a slight decrease during
2017.
▪Although construction activities remained weak in Latin America, sales were higher in the region.
▪Sales increased in EAME primarily due to higher demand and the favorable impact of currency, mostly from a stronger
euro. Higher demand was driven by increased construction activities across several countries in the region. Favorable price
realization also contributed to the sales increase.
▪Sales in Asia/Pacific were higher in several countries in the region, most significantly in China, stemming from increased
building construction and infrastructure investment. Changes in dealer inventories contributed to the sales improvement as
dealer inventories increased in 2018 and were about flat in 2017.

Table of Contents
Construction Industries’ profit was $4.174 billion in 2018, compared with $3.255 billion in 2017. The increase in profit was a result
of higher sales volume and favorable price realization, partially offset by higher material and freight costs, and increased
SG&A/R&D expenses, partially due to spending for strategic growth initiatives.
Construction Industries’ profit as a percent of total sales was 18.0 percent in 2018, compared with 16.9 percent in 2017.
Resource Industries
Resource Industries’ total sales were $10.270 billion in 2018, an increase of $2.409 billion from 2017. The increase was primarily
due to higher demand for both mining and heavy construction equipment, including aftermarket parts. Favorable commodity price
levels and increased mining production contributed to higher mining equipment sales. In addition, increased sales to heavy
construction, quarry and aggregate customers were driven by positive global economic growth. Resource Industries’ customers
globally continue to focus on improving productivity and efficiency of existing machine assets, thereby extending equipment life
cycles and lowering operating costs. Rebuild, overhaul and maintenance activity was robust, resulting in higher aftermarket parts
sales. Favorable price realization also contributed to the sales improvement.
Resource Industries’ profit was $1.603 billion in 2018, compared with $698 million in 2017. The improvement was mostly due to
higher sales volume and favorable price realization, partially offset by increased manufacturing costs and unfavorable currency
impacts. Manufacturing costs were unfavorable as lower warranty expense was more than offset by higher freight and material
costs.
Resource Industries’ profit as a percent of total sales was 15.6 percent in 2018, compared with 8.9 percent in 2017.

Energy & Transportation’s total sales were $22.785 billion in 2018, compared with $19.382 billion in 2017. The increase was
primarily due to higher sales volume across all applications. Favorable price realization also contributed to the increase in sales.
•Oil and Gas – Sales increased due to higher demand in North America for well servicing and gas compression
applications. Growth in U.S. onshore oil and gas drove increased sales for reciprocating engines and related aftermarket
parts. Sales of turbines and turbine-related services were higher for production applications.
•Power Generation – Sales improved across all regions, with the largest increase in North America, primarily for
reciprocating engine applications including data centers, and for aftermarket parts. In addition, sales increased in EAME
from reciprocating engine projects, turbines and turbine-related services and favorable currency.
•Industrial – Sales were higher in Asia/Pacific and North America, primarily due to improving economic conditions
supporting higher engine sales into industrial applications. Sales in EAME were about flat as economic uncertainty in a
few countries in the Middle East was mostly offset by favorable currency impacts.
•Transportation – Sales were higher for rail services driven by acquisitions in Asia/Pacific and EAME and increased rail
traffic in North America. Marine sales were higher in Asia/Pacific, led by increased activity in the ferry sector.
Energy & Transportation’s profit was $3.938 billion in 2018, compared with $2.856 billion in 2017. The improvement was due to
higher sales volume and favorable price realization. This was partially offset due to increased spending for strategic growth
initiatives and higher freight costs.
Energy & Transportation’s profit as a percent of total sales was 17.3 percent in 2018, compared with 14.7 percent in 2017.

Financial Products Segment
Financial Products’ segment revenues were $3.279 billion, an increase of $186 million, or 6 percent, from 2017. The increase was
primarily due to higher average financing rates and higher average earning assets in North America and Asia/Pacific. These
favorable impacts were partially offset by lower intercompany lending activity in North America, lower average earning assets in
Latin America and lower average financing rates in Europe.
Financial Products’ segment profit was $505 million in 2018, compared with $792 million in 2017. The decrease was primarily due
to an increase in the provision for credit losses at Cat Financial, an unfavorable impact from equity securities in Insurance Services
and lower intercompany lending activity. These unfavorable impacts were partially offset by higher average earning assets and an
increase in net yield on average earning assets.
At the end of 2018, past dues at Cat Financial were 3.55 percent, compared with 2.78 percent at the end of 2017. Write-offs, net of
recoveries, were $189 million for 2018, compared with $114 million for 2017. As of December 31, 2018, Cat Financial’s allowance
for credit losses totaled $511 million, or 1.80 percent of finance receivables, compared with $365 million, or 1.33 percent of
finance receivables at December 31, 2017. The increase in past dues, write-offs and allowance for credit losses was primarily due to
weakening in the Cat Power Finance portfolio.
Corporate Items and Eliminations
Expense for corporate items and eliminations was $1.566 billion in 2018, a decrease of $1.209 billion from 2017. The decrease in
expense was mostly due to lower restructuring costs and methodology differences. Restructuring costs were $394 million in 2018.
In 2017, restructuring costs impacting operating profit were $1.227 billion with about half related to the closure of the facility in
Gosselies, Belgium and the remainder related to other restructuring actions across the company.
RESTRUCTURING COSTS
Restructuring costs for 2019, 2018, and 2017 were as follows:

3 Represents costs related to our restructuring programs, primarily for project management, inventory write-downs, accelerated depreciation and equipment
relocation, and also LIFO inventory decrement benefits from inventory liquidations at closed facilities, all of which are primarily included in Cost of goods sold.
The restructuring costs in 2019 were primarily related to restructuring actions across the company. The restructuring costs in 2018
were primarily related to ongoing facility closures across the company. In 2017, about half of the restructuring costs were related to
the closure of the facility in Gosselies, Belgium, within Construction Industries, and the remainder was related to other
restructuring actions across the company.
Certain restructuring costs are a reconciling item between Segment profit and Consolidated profit before taxes.

In March 2017, Caterpillar informed Belgian authorities of the decision to proceed to a collective dismissal, which led to the
closure of the Gosselies site, impacting about 2,000 employees. Production of Caterpillar products at the Gosselies site ended
during the second quarter of 2017. The other operations and functions at the Gosselies site were phased out by the end of the
second quarter of 2018. The program concluded in 2018, and we incurred a total of $647 million of restructuring costs (primarily in
2017) under this program. These costs were primarily related to employee separation costs, long-lived asset impairments and other
costs which were partially offset by a LIFO inventory decrement benefit.
In September 2015, we announced a large scale restructuring plan (the Plan) including a voluntary retirement enhancement
program for qualifying U.S. employees, several voluntary separation programs outside of the United States, additional involuntary
programs throughout the company and manufacturing facility consolidations and closures. The largest action among those included
in the Plan was related to our European manufacturing footprint which led to the Gosselies, Belgium, facility closure as discussed
above. We incurred $43 million, $121 million and $817 million of restructuring costs associated with these actions in 2019, 2018
and 2017, respectively. The Plan concluded in 2019, and total restructuring costs incurred since the inception of the Plan were
$1,831 million.
In 2020, we expect to incur about $300 - $400 million of restructuring costs, about half for restructuring actions across the
company and the remainder for strategic actions to address a small number of products. We expect that prior restructuring actions
will result in an incremental benefit to operating costs, primarily Costs of goods sold and SG&A expenses of about $200 million in
2020 compared with 2019.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
 
Sources of funds
 
We generate significant capital resources from operating activities, which are the primary source of funding for our ME&T
operations. Funding for these businesses is also available from commercial paper and long-term debt issuances. Financial Products’
operations are funded primarily from commercial paper, term debt issuances and collections from its existing portfolio. During
2019, we experienced favorable liquidity conditions globally in both our ME&T and Financial Products' operations. On a
consolidated basis, we ended 2019 with $8.28 billion of cash, an increase of $427 million from year-end 2018. We intend to
maintain a strong cash and liquidity position.
 
Consolidated operating cash flow for 2019 was $6.91 billion, up from $6.56 billion in 2018. The increase was due to favorable
changes in working capital in 2019, mostly offset by lower profit adjusted for non-cash items, which included lower accruals for
short-term incentive compensation payments, and a larger discretionary pension contribution. Within working capital, changes to
inventories, accounts receivable, customer advances and accrued expenses favorably impacted cash flow but were partially offset
by changes in accounts payable. See further discussion of operating cash flow under ME&T and Financial Products.
Total debt as of December 31, 2019 was $37.66 billion, an increase of $1.10 billion from year-end 2018. Debt related to Financial
Products decreased $43 million. Debt related to ME&T increased $1.15 billion in 2019, primarily due to the issuance of debt to
finance a discretionary pension contribution, which was partially offset by the impact of new accounting guidance on a previously
failed sale-leaseback transaction in Japan. On September 19, 2019, we issued $1.0 billion of 3.250% Senior Notes due 2049 and
$500 million of 2.600% Senior Notes due 2029. During 2019, we repurchased $4.05 billion of Caterpillar common stock.
 
We have three global credit facilities with a syndicate of banks totaling $10.50 billion (Credit Facility) available in the aggregate to
both Caterpillar and Cat Financial for general liquidity purposes. Based on management’s allocation decision, which can be revised
from time to time, the portion of the Credit Facility available to ME&T as of December 31, 2019 was $2.75 billion. Information on
our Credit Facility is as follows:
46
Table of Contents
•The 364-day facility of $3.15 billion (of which $0.82 billion is available to ME&T) expires in September 2020.
•The three-year facility, as amended and restated in September 2019, of $2.73 billion (of which $0.72 billion is available to
ME&T) expires in September 2022.
•The five-year facility, as amended and restated in September 2019, of $4.62 billion (of which $1.21 billion is available to
ME&T) expires in September 2024.
At December 31, 2019, Caterpillar’s consolidated net worth was $14.63 billion, which was above the $9.00 billion required under
the Credit Facility.  The consolidated net worth is defined as the consolidated shareholder’s equity including preferred stock but
excluding the pension and other postretirement benefits balance within Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).
At December 31, 2019, Cat Financial’s covenant interest coverage ratio was 1.77 to 1.  This is above the 1.15 to 1 minimum ratio,
calculated as (1) profit excluding income taxes, interest expense and net gain/(loss) from interest rate derivatives to (2) interest
expense calculated at the end of each calendar quarter for the rolling four quarter period then most recently ended, required by the
Credit Facility.
In addition, at December 31, 2019, Cat Financial’s six-month covenant leverage ratio was 7.65 to 1 and year-end covenant leverage
ratio was 7.46 to 1.  This is below the maximum ratio of debt to net worth of 10 to 1, calculated (1) on a monthly basis as the
average of the leverage ratios determined on the last day of each of the six preceding calendar months and (2) at each December 31,
required by the Credit Facility.
In the event Caterpillar or Cat Financial does not meet one or more of their respective financial covenants under the Credit Facility
in the future (and are unable to obtain a consent or waiver), the syndicate of banks may terminate the commitments allocated to the
party that does not meet its covenants. Additionally, in such event, certain of Cat Financial's other lenders under other loan
agreements where similar financial covenants or cross default provisions are applicable, may, at their election, choose to pursue
remedies under those loan agreements, including accelerating the repayment of outstanding borrowings.  At December 31, 2019,
there were no borrowings under the Credit Facility.
Our total credit commitments and available credit as of December 31, 2019 were:

The other consolidated credit lines with banks as of December 31, 2019 totaled $5.00 billion. These committed and uncommitted
credit lines, which may be eligible for renewal at various future dates or have no specified expiration date, are used primarily by
our subsidiaries for local funding requirements.  Caterpillar or Cat Financial may guarantee subsidiary borrowings under these
lines.
 
We receive debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies. Moody’s rates our debt as “low-A”, while Fitch and S&P maintain a
“mid-A” debt rating. This split rating has not had a material impact on our borrowing costs or our overall financial health.
However, a downgrade of our credit ratings by any of the major credit rating agencies would result in increased borrowing costs
and could make access to certain credit markets more difficult. In the event economic conditions deteriorate such that access to debt
markets becomes unavailable, ME&T’s operations would rely on cash flow from operations, use of existing cash balances,
borrowings from Cat Financial and access to our Credit Facility. Our Financial Products’ operations would rely on cash flow from
its existing portfolio, existing cash balances, access to our Credit Facility and other credit line facilities of Cat Financial and
potential borrowings from Caterpillar. In addition, we maintain a support agreement with Cat Financial, which requires Caterpillar
to remain the sole owner of Cat Financial and may, under certain circumstances, require Caterpillar to make payments to Cat
Financial should Cat Financial fail to maintain certain financial ratios.

Machinery, Energy & Transportation
 
Net cash provided by operating activities was $4.87 billion in 2019, compared with $6.35 billion in 2018. The decrease was
primarily due to lower profit in 2019 adjusted for non-cash items, which included lower accruals for short-term compensation
payments, and a larger discretionary pension contribution partially offset by favorable changes in working capital. Within working
capital, changes to inventories, accounts receivable, customer advances and accrued expenses favorably impacted cash flow but
were partially offset by changes in accounts payable.
Net cash used for investing activities in 2019 was $48 million, compared with net cash used of $1.19 billion in 2018. The change
was primarily due to decreased ME&T lending with Financial Products during 2019 and the acquisitions of ECM S.p.A. and
Downer Freight Rail in 2018.
Net cash used for financing activities during 2019 was $4.48 billion, compared with net cash used of $5.47 billion in 2018. The
change was primarily due to the issuance of $1.5 billion of long-term debt used to fund a discretionary pension contribution. This
was partially offset by an increase in repurchases of Caterpillar common stock of $249 million and an increase in dividends paid of
$181 million.
 
While our short-term priorities for the use of cash may vary from time to time as business needs and conditions dictate, our long-
term cash deployment strategy is focused on the following priorities. Our top priority is to maintain a strong financial position in
support of a Mid-A rating. Next, we intend to fund operational requirements and commitments. Then, we intend to fund priorities
that profitably grow the company and return capital to shareholders through dividend growth and share repurchases. Additional
information on cash deployment is as follows:
 
Strong financial position — Our top priority is to maintain a strong financial position in support of a mid-A rating. We track a
diverse group of financial metrics that focus on liquidity, leverage, cash flow and margins which align with our cash
deployment actions and the various methodologies used by the major credit rating agencies.
Operational excellence and commitments — Capital expenditures were $1.07 billion during 2019, compared to $1.22 billion
in 2018. We expect ME&T’s capital expenditures in 2020 to be about $1.2 billion. We made $1.81 billion of contributions to
our pension and other postretirement benefit plans during 2019, including a $1.5 billion discretionary U.S. pension plan
contribution. By comparison, we made $1.35 billion of contributions to our pension and other postretirement plans in 2018,
including a $1.0 billion discretionary contribution made to our U.S. pension plans. We expect to make approximately $280
million of contributions to our pension and OPEB plans in 2020.
 
Fund strategic growth initiatives and return capital to shareholders — We intend to utilize our liquidity and debt capacity
to fund targeted investments that drive long-term profitable growth focused in the areas of expanded offerings and services,
including acquisitions.
As part of our new capital allocation strategy, ME&T free cash flow is a liquidity measure we will use going forward to
determine the cash generated and available for financing activities including debt repayments, dividends and share repurchases.
We define ME&T free cash flow as cash from ME&T operations excluding discretionary pension and other postretirement
benefit plan contributions less capital expenditures. A goal of our new capital allocation strategy is to return substantially all
ME&T free cash flow to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases, while maintaining our mid-A rating.
Our share repurchase plans are subject to the company’s cash deployment priorities and are evaluated on an ongoing basis
considering the financial condition of the company and the economic outlook, corporate cash flow, the company's liquidity
needs and the health and stability of global credit markets. The timing and amount of future repurchases may vary depending
on market conditions and investing priorities. In July 2018, the Board of Directors approved an authorization to repurchase up
to $10 billion of Caterpillar common stock (the 2018 Authorization) effective January 1, 2019, with no expiration. In 2019, we
repurchased $4.05 billion of Caterpillar common stock, with $5.95 billion remaining under the 2018 Authorization as of
December 31, 2019. Caterpillar's basic shares outstanding as of December 31, 2019 were approximately 550 million.
Each quarter, our Board of Directors reviews the company's dividend for the applicable quarter. The Board evaluates the
financial condition of the company and considers the economic outlook, corporate cash flow, the company's liquidity needs,
and the health and stability of global credit markets to determine whether to maintain or change the quarterly dividend.
Dividends totaled $2.13 billion in 2019, representing 86 cents per share paid in each of the first and second quarters and $1.03
per share paid in each of the third and fourth quarters.

Financial Products
 
Financial Products operating cash flow was $1.50 billion in 2019, compared with $1.52 billion in 2018. Net cash used for investing
activities was $414 million in 2019, compared with $2.78 billion in 2018. The change was primarily due to the impact of net
intercompany purchased receivables and higher collections of finance receivables. Net cash used for financing activities in 2019
was $991 million, compared with net cash provided by financing activities of $1.26 billion in 2018. The change was primarily due
to lower portfolio funding requirements and lower net intercompany borrowings, partially offset by a lower dividend payment to
ME&T.
Contractual obligations
 
The company has committed cash outflow related to long-term debt, operating lease agreements, postretirement benefit obligations,
purchase obligations, interest on long-term debt and other long-term contractual obligations. As of December 31, 2019, minimum

Off-balance sheet arrangements
We are a party to certain off-balance sheet arrangements, primarily in the form of guarantees. Information related to guarantees
appears in Note 21 – “Guarantees and product warranty” of Part II, Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data”.
RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
For a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements, see Note 1J — “New accounting guidance” of Part II, Item 8 “Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data.”
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts. The more significant estimates include: residual values for leased assets,
fair values for goodwill impairment tests, warranty liability, reserves for product liability and insurance losses, postretirement
benefits, post-sale discounts, credit losses and income taxes. We have incorporated many years of data into the determination of
each of these estimates and we have not historically experienced significant adjustments. These assumptions are reviewed at least
annually with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Following are the methods and assumptions used in determining our
estimates and an indication of the risks inherent in each.
 
Residual values for leased assets – The residual value of Cat Financial’s leased equipment is determined based on its estimated
end-of-term market value. We estimate the residual value of leased equipment at the inception of the lease based on a number of
factors, including historical wholesale market sales prices, past remarketing experience and any known significant market/product
trends. The following critical factors are also considered in our residual value estimates: lease term, market size and demand, total
expected hours of usage, machine configuration, application, location, model changes, quantities, third-party residual guarantees
and contractual customer purchase options.
Upon termination of the lease, the equipment is either purchased by the lessee or sold to a third party, in which case we may record
a gain or a loss for the difference between the estimated residual value and the sale price.
During the term of our leases, we monitor residual values.  For operating leases, adjustments to depreciation expense reflecting
changes in residual value estimates are recorded prospectively on a straight-line basis. For finance leases, residual value
adjustments are recognized through a reduction of finance revenue over the remaining lease term.
We evaluate the carrying value of equipment on operating leases for potential impairment when we determine a triggering event has
occurred. When a triggering event occurs, a test for recoverability is performed by comparing projected undiscounted future cash
flows to the carrying value of the equipment on operating leases. If the test for recoverability identifies a possible impairment, the
fair value of the equipment on operating leases is measured in accordance with the fair value measurement framework. An
impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value of the equipment on operating leases exceeds its
estimated fair value.
At December 31, 2019, the aggregate residual value of equipment on operating leases was $2.15 billion. Without consideration of
other factors such as third-party residual guarantees or contractual customer purchase options, a 10 percent non-temporary decrease
in the market value of our equipment subject to operating leases would reduce residual value estimates and result in the recognition
of approximately $80 million of additional annual depreciation expense.
Fair values for goodwill impairment tests – We test goodwill for impairment annually, at the reporting unit level, and whenever
events or circumstances make it more likely than not that an impairment may have occurred, such as a significant adverse change in
the business climate or a decision to sell all or a portion of a reporting unit. We perform our annual goodwill impairment test as of
October 1 and monitor for interim triggering events on an ongoing basis.
Goodwill is reviewed for impairment utilizing either a qualitative assessment or a quantitative goodwill impairment test. If we
choose to perform a qualitative assessment and determine the fair value more likely than not exceeds the carrying value, no further
evaluation is necessary. For reporting units where we perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test, we compare the fair value
of each reporting unit, which we primarily determine using an income approach based on the present value of discounted cash
flows, to the respective carrying value, which includes goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value,
the goodwill is not considered impaired. If the carrying value is higher than the fair value, the difference would be recognized as an
impairment loss.
50
Table of Contents
The impairment test process requires valuation of the respective reporting unit, which we primarily determine using an income
approach based on a discounted five year forecasted cash flow with a year-five residual value. The residual value is computed using
the constant growth method, which values the forecasted cash flows in perpetuity. The income approach is supported by a
reconciliation of our calculated fair value for Caterpillar to the company’s market capitalization. The assumptions about future cash
flows and growth rates are based on each reporting unit's long-term forecast and are subject to review and approval by senior
management. A reporting unit’s discount rate is a risk-adjusted weighted average cost of capital, which we believe approximates the
rate from a market participant’s perspective. The estimated fair value could be impacted by changes in market conditions, interest
rates, growth rates, tax rates, costs, pricing and capital expenditures. The fair value determination is categorized as Level 3 in the
fair value hierarchy due to its use of internal projections and unobservable measurement inputs.
Our annual impairment tests completed in the fourth quarter of 2019 indicated the fair value of each reporting unit was substantially
above its respective carrying value, including goodwill. Caterpillar’s market capitalization has remained significantly above the net
book value of the Company.
An unfavorable change in our expectations for the financial performance of our reporting units, particularly long-term growth and
profitability, would reduce the fair value of our reporting units. The demand for our equipment and related parts is highly cyclical
and significantly impacted by commodity prices, although the impact may vary by reporting unit. The energy and mining industries
are major users of our products, including the coal, iron ore, gold, copper, oil and natural gas industries. Decisions to purchase our
products are dependent upon the performance of those industries, which in turn are dependent in part on commodity prices. Lower
commodity prices or industry specific circumstances that have a negative impact to the valuation assumptions may reduce the fair
value of our reporting units. Should such events occur and it becomes more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value has
fallen below its carrying value, we will perform an interim goodwill impairment test(s), in addition to the annual impairment test.
 Future impairment tests may result in a goodwill impairment, depending on the outcome of the quantitative impairment test. A
goodwill impairment would be reported as a non-cash charge to earnings.
 
Warranty liability – At the time a sale is recognized, we record estimated future warranty costs.  The warranty liability is
determined by applying historical claim rate experience to the current field population and dealer inventory.  Generally, historical
claim rates are based on actual warranty experience for each product by machine model/engine size by customer or dealer location
(inside or outside North America).  Specific rates are developed for each product shipment month and are updated monthly based
on actual warranty claim experience.  Warranty costs may differ from those estimated if actual claim rates are higher or lower than
our historical rates.
 
Product liability and insurance loss reserve – We determine these reserves based upon reported claims in process of settlement
and actuarial estimates for losses incurred but not reported. Loss reserves, including incurred but not reported reserves, are based on
estimates and ultimate settlements may vary significantly from such estimates due to increased claims frequency or severity over
historical levels.
 
Postretirement benefits – We sponsor defined benefit pension plans and/or other postretirement benefit plans (retirement
healthcare and life insurance) to employees in many of our locations throughout the world. There are assumptions used in the
accounting for these defined benefit plans that include discount rate, expected return on plan assets, expected rate of compensation
increase, the future health care trend rate, mortality and other economic and demographic assumptions. The actuarial assumptions
we use may change or differ significantly from actual results, which may result in a material impact to our consolidated financial
statements.
The effects of actual results differing from our assumptions and the effects of changing assumptions are considered actuarial gains
or losses. We utilize a mark-to-market approach in recognizing actuarial gains or losses immediately through earnings upon the
annual remeasurement in the fourth quarter, or on an interim basis as triggering events warrant remeasurement.
Primary actuarial assumptions were determined as follows:
•The assumed discount rate is used to discount future benefit obligations back to today’s dollars. The U.S. discount rate is
based on a benefit cash flow-matching approach and represents the rate at which our benefit obligations could effectively
be settled as of our measurement date, December 31. The benefit cash flow-matching approach involves analyzing
Caterpillar’s projected cash flows against a high quality bond yield curve, calculated using a wide population of corporate
Aa bonds available on the measurement date. A similar approach is used to determine the assumed discount rate for our
most significant non-U.S. plans. In estimating the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost, we
utilize a full yield curve approach in determining a discount rate. This approach applies the specific spot rates along the
yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows.

Table of Contents
Discount rates are sensitive to changes in interest rates. A decrease in the discount rate would increase our obligation and
future expense.
•The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on our estimate of long-term passive returns for equities and
fixed income securities weighted by the allocation of our plan assets. Based on historical performance, we increase the
passive returns due to our active management of the plan assets. This rate is impacted by changes in general market
conditions, but because it represents a long-term rate, it is not significantly impacted by short-term market swings.
Changes in our allocation of plan assets would also impact this rate. For example, a shift to more fixed income securities
would lower the rate. A decrease in the rate would increase our expense. The expected return on plan assets is calculated
using the fair value of plan assets as of our measurement date, December 31.
•The expected rate of compensation increase is used to develop benefit obligations using projected pay at retirement. It
represents average long-term salary increases. This rate is influenced by our long-term compensation policies. An increase
in the rate would increase our obligation and expense.
•The assumed health care trend rate represents the rate at which health care costs are assumed to increase and is based on
historical and expected experience. Changes in our projections of future health care costs due to general economic
conditions and those specific to health care (e.g., technology driven cost changes) will impact this trend rate. An increase
in the trend rate would increase our obligation and expense.
•The mortality assumption is used to estimate the life expectancy of plan participants. An increase in the life expectancy of
plan participants will result in an increase in our obligation and expense.

Post-sale discount reserve – We provide discounts to dealers through merchandising programs. We have numerous programs that
are designed to promote the sale of our products. The most common dealer programs provide a discount when the dealer sells a
product to a targeted end user. The amount of accrued post-sale discounts was $1.7 billion and $1.5 billion as of December 31,
2019 and 2018, respectively.  The reserve represents discounts that we expect to pay on previously sold units and is reviewed at
least quarterly. The reserve is adjusted if discounts paid differ from those estimated. Historically, those adjustments have not been
material.
 
Credit loss reserve – The allowance for credit losses is an estimate of the losses inherent in our finance receivable portfolio and
includes consideration of accounts that have been individually identified as impaired, as well as pools of finance receivables where
it is probable that certain receivables in the pool are impaired but the individual accounts cannot yet be identified.   In identifying
and measuring impairment, management takes into consideration past loss experience, known and inherent risks in the portfolio,
adverse situations that may affect the borrower’s ability to repay, estimated value of underlying collateral and current economic
conditions.  
Accounts are identified for individual review based on past-due status and information available about the customer, such as
financial statements, news reports and published credit ratings, as well as general information regarding industry trends and the
economic environment in which our customers operate. The allowance for credit losses attributable to finance receivables that are
individually evaluated and determined to be impaired is based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the
receivables’ effective interest rate, the fair value of the collateral for collateral-dependent receivables or the observable market price
of the receivable.  In determining collateral value, we estimate the current fair market value of the collateral less selling costs. We
also consider credit enhancements such as additional collateral and contractual third-party guarantees. The allowance for credit
losses attributable to the remaining accounts not yet individually identified as impaired is estimated based on loss forecast models
utilizing probabilities of default, our estimate of the loss emergence period and the estimated loss given default.  In addition,
qualitative factors not able to be fully captured in our loss forecast models including industry trends, macroeconomic factors and
model imprecision are considered in the evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses.  These qualitative factors are
subjective and require a degree of management judgment.
While management believes it has exercised prudent judgment and applied reasonable assumptions, there can be no assurance that
in the future, changes in economic conditions or other factors would not cause changes in the financial health of our customers. If
the financial health of our customers deteriorates, the timing and level of payments received could be impacted and therefore, could
result in a change to our estimated losses.
Income taxes – We are subject to the income tax laws of the many jurisdictions in which we operate.  These tax laws are complex,
and the manner in which they apply to our facts is sometimes open to interpretation.  In establishing the provision for income taxes,
we must make judgments about the application of these inherently complex tax laws.  Our income tax positions and analysis are
based on currently enacted tax law.  Future changes in tax law or related interpretations could significantly impact the provision for
income taxes, the amount of taxes payable, and the deferred tax asset and liability balances. Changes in tax law are reflected in the
period of enactment with related interpretations considered in the period received. 
Despite our belief that our tax return positions are consistent with applicable tax laws, we believe that taxing authorities could
challenge certain positions. Settlement of any challenge can result in no change, a complete disallowance, or some partial
adjustment reached through negotiations or litigation. We record tax benefits for uncertain tax positions based upon management’s
evaluation of the information available at the reporting date.  To be recognized in the financial statements, a tax benefit must be at
least more likely than not of being sustained based on technical merits.  The benefit for positions meeting the recognition threshold
is measured as the largest benefit more likely than not of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has
full knowledge of all relevant information.  Significant judgment is required in making these determinations and adjustments to
unrecognized tax benefits may be necessary to reflect actual taxes payable upon settlement.  Adjustments related to positions
impacting the effective tax rate affect the provision for income taxes.  Adjustments related to positions impacting the timing of
deductions impact deferred tax assets and liabilities. For tax years 2007 to 2012 including the impact of a loss carryback to 2005,
the IRS has proposed to tax in the United States profits earned from certain parts transactions by Caterpillar SARL (CSARL), based
on the IRS examination team’s application of “substance-over-form” or “assignment-of-income” judicial doctrines. CSARL is
primarily taxable locally in Switzerland.  We are vigorously contesting the proposed increases to tax and penalties for these years of
approximately $2.3 billion. We believe that the relevant transactions complied with applicable tax laws and did not violate judicial
doctrines. The purchase of parts by CSARL from unrelated parties and the subsequent sale of those parts to unrelated dealers
outside the United States have substantial legal, commercial, and economic consequences for the parties involved.   Therefore, we
have concluded that the largest amount of benefit that is more likely than not to be sustained related to this position is the entire
benefit.  As a result, no amount related to these IRS adjustments is reflected in unrecognized tax benefits. We have filed U.S.
income tax returns on this same basis for years after 2012.  We currently believe the ultimate disposition of this matter will not have
a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, liquidity or results of operations.

Table of Contents
Deferred tax assets generally represent tax benefits for tax deductions or credits available in future tax returns.  Certain estimates
and assumptions are required to determine whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the benefit of a deferred tax
asset will not be realized.  In making this assessment, management analyzes the trend of U.S. GAAP earnings and estimates the
impact of future taxable income, reversing temporary differences and available prudent and feasible tax planning strategies.  We
give less weight in this analysis to mark-to-market adjustments to remeasure our pension and OPEB plans as we do not consider
these adjustments indicative of ongoing earnings trends. Should a change in facts or circumstances lead to a change in judgment
about the ultimate realizability of a deferred tax asset, we record or adjust the related valuation allowance in the period that the
change in facts and circumstances occurs, along with a corresponding increase or decrease in the provision for income taxes. 
Additional information related to income taxes is included in Note 6 - “Income taxes” of Part II, Item 8 “Financial statements and
Supplementary Data.”
OTHER MATTERS
 
ENVIRONMENTAL AND LEGAL MATTERS
The Company is regulated by federal, state and international environmental laws governing our use, transport and disposal of
substances and control of emissions. In addition to governing our manufacturing and other operations, these laws often impact the
development of our products, including, but not limited to, required compliance with air emissions standards applicable to internal
combustion engines. We have made, and will continue to make, significant research and development and capital expenditures to
comply with these emissions standards.
We are engaged in remedial activities at a number of locations, often with other companies, pursuant to federal and state laws.
When it is probable we will pay remedial costs at a site, and those costs can be reasonably estimated, the investigation, remediation,
and operating and maintenance costs are accrued against our earnings. Costs are accrued based on consideration of currently
available data and information with respect to each individual site, including available technologies, current applicable laws and
regulations, and prior remediation experience. Where no amount within a range of estimates is more likely, we accrue the
minimum. Where multiple potentially responsible parties are involved, we consider our proportionate share of the probable costs.
In formulating the estimate of probable costs, we do not consider amounts expected to be recovered from insurance companies or
others. We reassess these accrued amounts on a quarterly basis. The amount recorded for environmental remediation is not material
and is included in Accrued expenses. We believe there is no more than a remote chance that a material amount for remedial
activities at any individual site, or at all the sites in the aggregate, will be required.
On January 27, 2020, the Brazilian Federal Environmental Agency (“IBAMA”) issued Caterpillar Brasil Ltda a notice of violation
regarding allegations around the requirements for use of imported oils at the Piracicaba, Brazil facility.  We have instituted
processes to address the allegations.  While we are still discussing resolution of these allegations with IBAMA, the initial notice
from IBAMA included a proposed fine of approximately $370,000.  We do not expect this fine or our response to address the
allegations to have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity.
On January 7, 2015, the Company received a grand jury subpoena from the U.S. District Court for the Central District of Illinois.
The subpoena requests documents and information from the Company relating to, among other things, financial information
concerning U.S. and non-U.S. Caterpillar subsidiaries (including undistributed profits of non-U.S. subsidiaries and the movement
of cash among U.S. and non-U.S. subsidiaries). The Company has received additional subpoenas relating to this investigation
requesting additional documents and information relating to, among other things, the purchase and resale of replacement parts by
Caterpillar Inc. and non-U.S. Caterpillar subsidiaries, dividend distributions of certain non-U.S. Caterpillar subsidiaries, and
Caterpillar SARL and related structures. On March 2-3, 2017, agents with the Department of Commerce, the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation and the Internal Revenue Service executed search and seizure warrants at three facilities of the Company in
the Peoria, Illinois area, including its former corporate headquarters. The warrants identify, and agents seized, documents and
information related to, among other things, the export of products from the United States, the movement of products between the
United States and Switzerland, the relationship between Caterpillar Inc. and Caterpillar SARL, and sales outside the United States.
It is the Company’s understanding that the warrants, which concern both tax and export activities, are related to the ongoing grand
jury investigation. The Company is continuing to cooperate with this investigation. The Company is unable to predict the outcome
or reasonably estimate any potential loss; however, we currently believe that this matter will not have a material adverse effect on
the Company’s consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity.

On March 20, 2014, Brazil’s Administrative Council for Economic Defense (CADE) published a Technical Opinion which named
18 companies and over 100 individuals as defendants, including two subsidiaries of Caterpillar Inc., MGE - Equipamentos e
Serviços Ferroviários Ltda. (MGE) and Caterpillar Brasil Ltda. The publication of the Technical Opinion opened CADE’s official
administrative investigation into allegations that the defendants participated in anticompetitive bid activity for the construction and
maintenance of metro and train networks in Brazil. While companies cannot be held criminally liable for anticompetitive conduct
in Brazil, criminal charges have been brought against one current employee of MGE and two former employees of MGE involving
the same conduct alleged by CADE. On July 8, 2019, CADE found MGE, one of its current employees and two of its former
employees liable for anticompetitive conduct. CBL was dismissed from the proceeding without any finding of liability. MGE
intends to appeal CADE's findings. We currently believe that this matter will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity.
In addition, we are involved in other unresolved legal actions that arise in the normal course of business. The most prevalent of
these unresolved actions involve disputes related to product design, manufacture and performance liability (including claimed
asbestos exposure), contracts, employment issues, environmental matters, intellectual property rights, taxes (other than income
taxes) and securities laws. The aggregate range of reasonably possible losses in excess of accrued liabilities, if any, associated with
these unresolved legal actions is not material. In some cases, we cannot reasonably estimate a range of loss because there is
insufficient information regarding the matter. However, we believe there is no more than a remote chance that any liability arising
from these matters would be material. Although it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of these unresolved legal
actions, we believe that these actions will not individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our consolidated
results of operations, financial position or liquidity.
 
RETIREMENT BENEFITS
We recognize mark-to-market gains and losses immediately through earnings upon the remeasurement of our pension and OPEB
plans. Mark-to-market gains and losses represent the effects of actual results differing from our assumptions and the effects of
changing assumptions. Changes in discount rates and differences between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return
on plan assets generally have the largest impact on mark-to-market gains and losses.
The table below summarizes the amounts of net periodic benefit cost recognized for 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and
includes expected cost for 2020.

1 Expected net periodic benefit cost (benefit) does not include an estimate for mark-to-market gains or losses.
•Expected decrease in expense in 2020 compared to 2019 - Excluding the impact of mark-to-market gains and losses, our net
periodic benefit cost is expected to decrease $332 million in 2020. This decrease is primarily due to lower interest cost as a
result of lower discount rates at year-end 2019, elimination of service cost for our U.S. pension plans freezing benefit accruals
and higher expected return on plan assets due to a higher asset base at year-end 2019.
•Increase in expense in 2019 compared to 2018 - Primarily due to lower expected return on plan assets (U.S. pension plans
had an expected rate of return of 5.9 percent in 2019 compared to 6.3 percent in 2018) and higher interest costs due to higher
discount rates at year-end 2018.
•Increase in expense in 2018 compared to 2017 - Primarily due to higher net mark-to-market losses in 2018 compared to
2017. This was partially offset by a higher expected return on plan assets and curtailment gains compared to curtailment and
termination charges in 2017.
The primary factors that resulted in mark-to-market losses for 2019, 2018 and 2017 are described below. The net mark-to-market
losses were included in Other income (expense) in the Results of Operations.
56
Table of Contents
•2019 net mark-to-market loss of $468 million - Primarily due to lower discount rates at the end of 2019 compared to the end
of 2018. This was partially offset by a higher actual return on plan assets compared to the expected return on plan assets (U.S.
pension plans had an actual rate of return of 22.3 percent compared to an expected rate of return of 5.9 percent).
•2018 net mark-to-market loss of $495 million - Primarily due to the difference between the actual return on plan assets
compared to the expected return on plan assets (U.S. pension plans had an actual rate of return of negative 5.4 percent
compared to an expected rate of return of 6.3 percent). This was partially offset by higher discount rates at the end of 2018
compared to the end of 2017.
•2017 net mark-to-market loss of $301 million - Primarily due to lower discount rates at the end of 2017 compared to the end
of 2016 and changes in our mortality assumption (discussed below). This was partially offset by the difference between the
actual return on plan assets compared to the expected return on plan assets (U.S. pension plans had an actual rate of return of
15.5 percent compared to an expected rate of return of 6.7 percent).
In the fourth quarter of 2017, the company reviewed and made changes to the mortality assumptions primarily for our U.S. pension
plans which resulted in an overall increase in the life expectancy of plan participants. As of December 31, 2017 these changes
resulted in an increase in our Liability for postemployment benefits of approximately $290 million.
In the first quarter of 2017, we announced the closure of our Gosselies, Belgium facility. This announcement impacted certain
employees that participated in a defined benefit pension plan and resulted in a net loss of $20 million in the first quarter of 2017 for
curtailment and termination benefits.
SENSITIVITY
 
Foreign Exchange Rate Sensitivity
 
ME&T operations use foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage unmatched foreign currency cash inflow and
outflow. Our objective is to minimize the risk of exchange rate movements that would reduce the U.S. dollar value of our foreign
currency cash flow. Our policy allows for managing anticipated foreign currency cash flow for up to approximately five years.
Based on the anticipated and firmly committed cash inflow and outflow for our ME&T operations for the next 12 months and the
foreign currency derivative instruments in place at year-end, a hypothetical 10 percent weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to all
other currencies would adversely affect our expected 2020 cash flow for our ME&T operations by approximately $225 million.
Last year similar assumptions and calculations yielded a potential $250 million adverse impact on 2019 cash flow.  We determine
our net exposures by calculating the difference in cash inflow and outflow by currency and adding or subtracting outstanding
foreign currency derivative instruments. We multiply these net amounts by 10 percent to determine the sensitivity.
 
In managing foreign currency risk for our Financial Products operations, our objective is to minimize earnings volatility resulting
from conversion and the remeasurement of net foreign currency balance sheet positions and future transactions denominated in
foreign currencies. Since our policy allows the use of foreign currency forward, option and cross currency contracts to offset the
risk of currency mismatch between our assets and liabilities and exchange rate risk associated with future transactions denominated
in foreign currencies, a 10 percent change in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to all other currencies would not have a material
effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flow. Neither our policy nor the effect of a 10 percent
change in the value of the U.S. dollar has changed from that reported at the end of last year.
The effect of the hypothetical change in exchange rates ignores the effect this movement may have on other variables, including
competitive risk. If it were possible to quantify this competitive impact, the results would probably be different from the sensitivity
effects shown above. In addition, it is unlikely that all currencies would uniformly strengthen or weaken relative to the U.S. dollar.
In reality, some currencies may weaken while others may strengthen. Our primary exposure (excluding competitive risk) is to
exchange rate movements in the Swiss franc, Chinese yuan, Japanese yen, Indian rupee, and Australian dollar.
 
Interest Rate Sensitivity
 
For our ME&T operations, we have the option to use interest rate contracts to lower the cost of borrowed funds by attaching fixed-
to-floating interest rate contracts to fixed-rate debt, and by entering into forward rate agreements on future debt issuances.  A
hypothetical 100 basis point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would have a minimal impact to
the 2020 pre-tax earnings of ME&T. Last year, similar assumptions and calculations yielded a minimal impact to 2019 pre-tax
earnings.

Table of Contents
For our Financial Products operations, we use interest rate derivative instruments primarily to meet our match-funding objectives
and strategies. We have a match-funding policy that addresses the interest rate risk by aligning the interest rate profile (fixed or
floating rate and duration) of our debt portfolio with the interest rate profile of our finance receivable portfolio within
predetermined range on an ongoing basis. In connection with that policy, we use interest rate derivative instruments to modify the
debt structure to match assets within the finance receivable portfolio. Match funding reduces the volatility of margins between
interest-bearing assets and interest-bearing liabilities, regardless of which direction interest rates move.
 
In order to properly manage sensitivity to changes in interest rates, Financial Products measures the potential impact of different
interest rate assumptions on pre-tax earnings. All on-balance sheet positions, including derivative financial instruments, are
included in the analysis. The primary assumptions included in the analysis are that there are no new fixed rate assets or liabilities,
the proportion of fixed rate debt to fixed rate assets remains unchanged and the level of floating rate assets and debt remain
constant. An analysis of the December 31, 2019 balance sheet, using these assumptions, estimates the impact of a 100 basis point
immediate and sustained adverse change in interest rates to have a minimal impact on 2020 pre-tax earnings.  Last year, similar
assumptions and calculations yielded a minimal impact to 2019 pre-tax earnings.
 
This analysis does not necessarily represent our current outlook of future market interest rate movement, nor does it consider any
actions management could undertake in response to changes in interest rates. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that actual
results would be consistent with the results of our estimate.
NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
The following definitions are provided for the non-GAAP financial measures used in this report.  These non-GAAP financial
measures have no standardized meaning prescribed by U.S. GAAP and therefore are unlikely to be comparable to the calculation of
similar measures for other companies.  Management does not intend these items to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for
the related GAAP measures.
We believe it is important to separately quantify the profit impact of several significant items in order for our results to be
meaningful to our readers. These items consist of (i) pension and OPEB mark-to-market losses resulting from plan
remeasurements, (ii) U.S. tax reform impact, (iii) restructuring costs in 2018, which were incurred to generate longer-term benefits
and (iv) certain deferred tax valuation allowance adjustments. We do not consider these items indicative of earnings from ongoing
business activities and believe the non-GAAP measures will provide investors with useful perspective on underlying business
results and trends and aid with assessing our period-over-period results. In addition, we provide a calculation of ME&T free cash
flow as we believe it is an important measure for investors to determine the cash generation available for financing activities
including debt repayments, dividends and share repurchases.

MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON
INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
 
The management of Caterpillar Inc. (company) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act.  Our internal control over financial reporting
is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
 
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because
of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
 
Management assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019. In
making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(COSO) in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013). Based on our assessment we concluded that, as of December 31, 2019,
the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria.
 
The effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019 has been audited by
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm. Their report appears on pages 66-67.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Caterpillar Inc.
Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the accompanying consolidated statement of financial position of Caterpillar Inc. and its subsidiaries (the
“Company”) as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the related consolidated statements of results of operations, comprehensive
income (loss), changes in shareholders’ equity, and cash flow for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019,
including the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control -
Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position
of the Company as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 2019 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.
Basis for Opinions
The Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control
over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the
accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the
Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.
We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and
are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable
rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement,
whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of
the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such
procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial
statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as
well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial
reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material
weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain
to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of
the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that
could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because
of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial
statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or
disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or
complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated
financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate
opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Uncertain Tax Position - Caterpillar SARL IRS Examination
As described in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements, as a result of the audits of the Company’s U.S. 2007 to 2012
income tax returns, including the impact of a loss carryback to 2005, the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) has proposed to tax in
the U.S. profits earned from certain parts transactions by Caterpillar SARL (“CSARL”). This proposal is based on the IRS
examination team’s application of the “substance-over-form” or “assignment-of-income” judicial doctrines. As described by
management, the Company is vigorously contesting the proposed increases to tax and penalties for these years of approximately
$2.3 billion, as management believes that the relevant transactions complied with applicable tax laws and did not violate judicial
doctrines. As disclosed by management, the purchase of parts by CSARL from unrelated parties and the subsequent sale of those
parts to unrelated dealers outside the U.S. have substantial legal, commercial, and economic consequences for the parties involved.
Management has concluded that the largest amount of benefit that is more likely than not to be sustained related to this position is
the entire benefit. As a result, no amount related to these IRS adjustments is reflected in the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits.
The Company has filed U.S. income tax returns on this same basis for years after 2012.
The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the uncertain tax position arising from the
CSARL IRS Examination is a critical audit matter are there was significant judgment by management in evaluating the amount of
the benefit that is more likely than not to be sustained related to the position, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment,
subjectivity and effort in performing procedures to evaluate whether the position was more likely than not to be sustained. Also, the
audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in evaluating the audit evidence
obtained from these procedures.
Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall
opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the
uncertain tax position arising from the CSARL IRS Examination. These procedures also included, among others, (i) evaluating
management’s process for determining the reasonableness of the uncertain tax position, including reading certain intercompany and
third-party agreements which are relevant to evaluating the legal form and substance of the CSARL transaction flows; (ii)
evaluating management’s assessment of whether the position was more likely than not to produce a tax benefit and the
determination by management of the largest amount of benefit that is more likely than not to be sustained related to this position;
and (iii) evaluating the Revenue Agent Reports (“RARs”) from the IRS and management’s protests of the RARs. Professionals with
specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating the applicable tax laws and judicial doctrines related to this matter
as well as changes in relevant tax regulations, rulings, and case law.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 
1.Operations and summary of significant accounting policies
 
A.Nature of operations
 
Information in our financial statements and related commentary are presented in the following categories:
 
Machinery, Energy & Transportation (ME&T) – Represents the aggregate total of Construction Industries, Resource
Industries, Energy & Transportation and All Other operating segment and related corporate items and eliminations.
 
Financial Products – Primarily includes the company’s Financial Products Segment.  This category includes Caterpillar
Financial Services Corporation (Cat Financial), Caterpillar Insurance Holdings Inc. (Insurance Services) and their
respective subsidiaries.
 
Our products are sold primarily under the brands “Caterpillar,” “CAT,” design versions of “CAT” and “Caterpillar,” “EMD,”
“FG Wilson,” “MaK,” “MWM,” “Perkins,” “Progress Rail,” “SEM” and “Solar Turbines”.
 
We conduct operations in our ME&T lines of business under highly competitive conditions, including intense price
competition. We place great emphasis on the high quality and performance of our products and our dealers’ service support.
Although no one competitor is believed to produce all of the same types of equipment that we do, there are numerous
companies, large and small, which compete with us in the sale of each of our products.
 
Our machines are distributed principally through a worldwide organization of dealers (dealer network), 46 located in the
United States and 119 located outside the United States, serving 191 countries.  Reciprocating engines are sold principally
through the dealer network and to other manufacturers for use in products. Some of the reciprocating engines manufactured by
our subsidiary Perkins Engines Company Limited, are also sold through its worldwide network of 67 distributors covering 178
countries. The FG Wilson branded electric power generation systems primarily manufactured by our subsidiary Caterpillar
Northern Ireland Limited are sold through its worldwide network of 150 distributors covering 109 countries.  Some of the
large, medium speed reciprocating engines are also sold under the MaK brand through a worldwide network of 20 distributors
covering 130 countries.  Our dealers do not deal exclusively with our products; however, in most cases sales and servicing of
our products are the dealers’ principal business. Some products, primarily turbines and locomotives, are sold directly to end
customers through sales forces employed by the company. At times, these employees are assisted by independent sales
representatives.
 
The Financial Products line of business also conducts operations under highly competitive conditions. Financing for users of
Caterpillar products is available through a variety of competitive sources, principally commercial banks and finance and
leasing companies. We offer various financing plans designed to increase the opportunity for sales of our products and generate
financing income for our company. A significant portion of Financial Products activity is conducted in North America, with
additional offices in Latin America, Asia/Pacific, Europe, Africa and the Middle East.
B.Basis of presentation
 
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Caterpillar Inc. and its subsidiaries where we have a controlling
financial interest.
Investments in companies where our ownership exceeds 20 percent and we do not have a controlling interest or where the
ownership is less than 20 percent and for which we have a significant influence are accounted for by the equity method.  
We consolidate all variable interest entities (VIEs) where Caterpillar Inc. is the primary beneficiary.  For VIEs, we assess
whether we are the primary beneficiary as prescribed by the accounting guidance on the consolidation of VIEs.  The primary
beneficiary of a VIE is the party that has both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity’s
economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to
the VIE. See Note 21 for further discussion on a consolidated VIE.
We have affiliates, suppliers and dealers that are VIEs of which we are not the primary beneficiary. Although we have provided
financial support, we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of
each entity. Our maximum exposure to loss from these VIEs for which we are not the primary beneficiary was $133 million
and $131 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
74
Table of Contents
Cat Financial has end-user customers that are VIEs of which we are not the primary beneficiary. Although we have provided
financial support to these entities and therefore have a variable interest, we do not have the power to direct the activities that
most significantly impact their economic performance. Our maximum exposure to loss from our involvement with these VIEs
is limited to the credit risk inherently present in the financial support that we have provided. These risks are evaluated and
reflected in our financial statements as part of our overall portfolio of finance receivables and related allowance for credit
losses.
Shipping and handling costs are included in Cost of goods sold in Statement 1.  Other operating (income) expenses primarily
include Cat Financial’s depreciation of equipment leased to others, Insurance Services’ underwriting expenses, (gains) losses
on disposal of long-lived assets, long-lived asset impairment charges, legal settlements and accruals, contract termination costs
and employee separation charges.
 
Prepaid expenses and other current assets in Statement 3 primarily include prepaid insurance, contract assets, right of return
assets, prepaid and refundable income taxes, assets held for sale, core to be returned for remanufacturing, restricted cash and
other short-term investments.
Certain amounts for prior years have been reclassified to conform with the current-year financial statement presentation.
C.Inventories
 
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is principally determined using the last-in, first-out
(LIFO) method. The value of inventories on the LIFO basis represented about 60 percent and 65 percent of total inventories at
December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
 
If the FIFO (first-in, first-out) method had been in use, inventories would have been $2,086 million and $2,009 million higher
than reported at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
D.Depreciation and amortization
 
Depreciation of plant and equipment is computed principally using accelerated methods. Depreciation on equipment leased to
others, primarily for Financial Products, is computed using the straight-line method over the term of the lease. The depreciable
basis is the original cost of the equipment less the estimated residual value of the equipment at the end of the lease term. In
2019, 2018 and 2017, Cat Financial depreciation on equipment leased to others was $813 million, $819 million and $810
million, respectively, and was included in Other operating (income) expenses in Statement 1. In 2019, 2018 and 2017,
consolidated depreciation expense was $2,253 million, $2,435 million and $2,555 million, respectively. Amortization of
purchased finite-lived intangibles is computed principally using the straight-line method, generally not to exceed a period of 20
years.
 
E.Foreign currency translation
 
The functional currency for most of our ME&T consolidated companies is the U.S. dollar. The functional currency for most of
our Financial Products and affiliates accounted for under the equity method is the respective local currency.  Gains and losses
resulting from the remeasurement of foreign currency amounts to the functional currency are included in Other income
(expense) in Statement 1. Gains and losses resulting from translating assets and liabilities from the functional currency to U.S.
dollars are included in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in Statement 3.
 
F.Derivative financial instruments
 
Our earnings and cash flow are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and
commodity prices.  Our Risk Management Policy (policy) allows for the use of derivative financial instruments to prudently
manage foreign currency exchange rate, interest rate and commodity price exposures. Our policy specifies that derivatives are
not to be used for speculative purposes. Derivatives that we use are primarily foreign currency forward, option and cross
currency contracts, interest rate contracts and commodity forward and option contracts. All derivatives are recorded at fair
value.  See Note 4 for more information.
75
G.Income taxes
 
The provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach taking into account guidance related to
uncertain tax positions.  Tax laws require items to be included in tax filings at different times than the items are reflected in the
financial statements.  A current liability is recognized for the estimated taxes payable for the current year.  Deferred taxes
represent the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or
paid.  Deferred taxes are adjusted for enacted changes in tax rates and tax laws.  Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce
deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. See Note 6 for further discussion.
H.Goodwill
 
For acquisitions accounted for as a business combination, goodwill represents the excess of the cost over the fair value of the
net assets acquired.  We are required to test goodwill for impairment, at the reporting unit level, annually and when events or
circumstances make it more likely than not that an impairment may have occurred.  A reporting unit is an operating segment or
one level below an operating segment (referred to as a component) to which goodwill is assigned when initially recorded. We
assign goodwill to reporting units based on our integration plans and the expected synergies resulting from the
acquisition.  Because Caterpillar is a highly integrated company, the businesses we acquire are sometimes combined with or
integrated into existing reporting units.  When changes occur in the composition of our operating segments or reporting units,
goodwill is reassigned to the affected reporting units based on their relative fair values. 
We perform our annual goodwill impairment test as of October 1 and monitor for interim triggering events on an ongoing
basis.  Goodwill is reviewed for impairment utilizing either a qualitative assessment or a quantitative goodwill impairment
test.  If we choose to perform a qualitative assessment and determine the fair value more likely than not exceeds the carrying
value, no further evaluation is necessary.  For reporting units where we perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test, we
compare the fair value of each reporting unit, which we primarily determine using an income approach based on the present
value of discounted cash flows, to the respective carrying value, which includes goodwill.  If the fair value of the reporting unit
exceeds its carrying value, the goodwill is not considered impaired.  If the carrying value is higher than the fair value, the
difference would be recognized as an impairment loss. See Note 10 for further details.
I.Estimates in financial statements
 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts. The more significant estimates
include: residual values for leased assets; fair values for goodwill impairment tests; warranty liability and reserves for product
liability and insurance losses, postretirement benefits, post-sale discounts, credit losses and income taxes.
J.New accounting guidance
 
Adoption of new accounting standards
Lease accounting - (Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-02) - In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board (FASB) issued accounting guidance that revises the accounting for leases. Under the new guidance, lessees are required
to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for substantially all leases. The new guidance continues to classify leases
as either financing or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition. The accounting applied by a
lessor under the new guidance is substantially equivalent to prior lease accounting guidance. The new guidance was effective
January 1, 2019 and was applied using a modified retrospective approach through a cumulative effect adjustment to retained
earnings as of January 1, 2019. The prior period comparative information has not been recast and continues to be reported
under the accounting guidance in effect for those periods.
The new guidance provides a number of optional practical expedients in transition. We elected the “package of practical
expedients,” which allows us not to reassess under the new guidance our prior conclusions about lease identification, lease
classification and initial direct costs. We did not elect the use-of-hindsight practical expedient. In addition, the new guidance
provides practical expedients for an entity’s ongoing lessee accounting. For certain property and information technology
equipment leases, we have elected to separate payments for lease components from non-lease components. For all other leases,
we have elected not to separate lease and non-lease components. We have elected the short-term lease recognition exemption
for all leases that qualify, which means we have not recognized right-of-use assets or lease liabilities for these leases with a
term of twelve months or less.
76
Table of Contents
The most significant effects of adoption relate to the recognition of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on our balance sheet
for operating leases and providing new disclosures about our leasing activities. In addition, we derecognized existing assets
and debt obligations for a sale-leaseback transaction that qualified for sale accounting under the new guidance. The gain
associated with this change in accounting was recognized through opening retained earnings as of January 1, 2019. The
adoption did not have a material impact on our financial statements.
In March 2019, the FASB issued Leases - Codification improvements (ASU 2019-01) which amended the new leasing
guidance. Under these amendments, lessors that are not manufacturers or dealers will use their cost, less any discounts that
may apply, as the fair value of the underlying asset, and lessors within the scope of Financial Services-Depository and Lending
guidance will present all principal payments received under leases within investment activities on the statement of cash flows. 
We adopted the new guidance effective January 1, 2019, and the adoption did not have a material impact to our financial
statements.
See Note 20 for additional information.
The cumulative effect of initially applying the new lease guidance to our consolidated financial statements on January 1, 2019
was as follows:

Accounting standards issued but not yet adopted
Credit losses (ASU 2016-13) – In June 2016, the FASB issued accounting guidance to introduce a new model for recognizing
credit losses on financial instruments based on an estimate of current expected credit losses.  The new guidance will apply to
loans, accounts receivable, trade receivables, other financial assets measured at amortized cost, loan commitments and other
off-balance sheet credit exposures.  The new guidance will also apply to debt securities and other financial assets measured at
fair value through other comprehensive income.  The new guidance was effective January 1, 2020.  We do not expect the
adoption to have a material impact on our financial statements.
77
Table of Contents
We consider the applicability and impact of all ASUs. ASUs not listed above were assessed and either determined to be not
applicable or not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements.
2.Sales and revenue recognition
A. Sales of Machinery, Energy & Transportation
Sales of ME&T are recognized when all the following criteria are satisfied: (i) a contract with an independently owned and
operated dealer or an end user exists which has commercial substance; (ii) it is probable we will collect the amount charged to
the dealer or end user; and (iii) we have completed our performance obligation whereby the dealer or end user has obtained
control of the product. A contract with commercial substance exists once we receive and accept a purchase order under a dealer
sales agreement, or once we enter into a contract with an end user. If collectibility is not probable, the sale is deferred and not
recognized until collection is probable or payment is received. Control of our products typically transfers when title and risk of
ownership of the product has transferred to the dealer or end user. Typically, where product is produced and sold in the same
country, title and risk of ownership transfer when the product is shipped. Products that are exported from a country for sale
typically transfer title and risk of ownership at the border of the destination country.
Our remanufacturing operations are primarily focused on the remanufacture of Cat engines and components and rail related
products.  In this business, used engines and related components (core) are inspected, cleaned and remanufactured.  In
connection with the sale of our remanufactured product to dealers, we collect a deposit that is repaid if the dealer returns an
acceptable core within a specified time period.  Caterpillar owns and has title to the cores when they are returned from dealers. 
The rebuilt engine or component (the core plus any new content) is then sold as a remanufactured product to dealers and end
users.  Revenue is recognized pursuant to the same transfer of control criteria as ME&T sales noted above.  At the time of sale,
the deposit is recognized in Other current liabilities in Statement 3, and the core to be returned is recognized as an asset in
Prepaid expenses and other current assets in Statement 3 at the estimated replacement cost (based on historical experience with
usable cores).  Upon receipt of an acceptable core, we repay the deposit and relieve the liability.  The returned core asset is then
transferred into inventory. In the event that the deposit is forfeited (i.e., upon failure by the dealer to return an acceptable core
in the specified time period), we recognize the core deposit and the cost of the core in Sales and Cost of goods sold,
respectively. 
We provide discounts to dealers through merchandising programs. We have numerous programs that are designed to promote
the sale of our products.  The most common dealer programs provide a discount when the dealer sells a product to a targeted
end user.  Generally, the cost of these discounts is estimated for each product by model by geographic region based on
historical experience and known changes in merchandising programs. The cost of these discounts is reported as a reduction to
the transaction price when the product sale is recognized. A corresponding post-sale discount reserve is accrued in Statement 3,
which represents discounts we expect to pay on units sold. If discounts paid differ from those estimated, the difference is
reported as a change in the transaction price.
Except for replacement parts, no right of return exists on the sale of our products.  We estimate replacement part returns based
on historical experience and recognize a parts return asset in Prepaid expenses and other current assets in Statement 3, which
represents our right to recover replacement parts we expect will be returned. We also recognize a refund liability in Other
current liabilities in Statement 3 for the refund we expect to pay for returned parts. If actual replacement part returns differ
from those estimated, the difference in the estimated replacement part return asset and refund liability is recognized in Cost of
goods sold and Sales, respectively.
Our standard dealer invoice terms are established by marketing region. Our invoice terms for end user sales are established by
the responsible business unit. Payments from dealers are due shortly after the time of sale. When a sale is made to a dealer, the
dealer is responsible for payment even if the product is not sold to an end user. Dealers and end users must make payment
within the established invoice terms to avoid potential interest costs. Interest at or above prevailing market rates may be
charged on any past due balance, and generally our practice is to not forgive this interest. In addition, Cat Financial provides
wholesale inventory financing for a dealer’s purchase of inventory. Wholesale inventory receivables have varying payment
terms and are included in Receivables – trade and other and Long-term receivables – trade and other in Statement 3. See Note
7 for further information. Trade receivables from dealers and end users were $7,648 million, $7,743 million and $6,399 million
as of December 31, 2019, December 31, 2018 and January 1, 2018, respectively, and are recognized in Receivables – trade and
other in Statement 3. Long-term trade receivables from dealers and end users were $693 million, $674 million and $639
million as of December 31, 2019, December 31, 2018 and January 1, 2018, respectively, and are recognized in Long-term
receivables – trade and other in Statement 3.
78
Table of Contents
We establish a bad debt allowance for ME&T receivables when it becomes probable that the receivable will not be collected.
Our allowance for bad debts is not significant.
We invoice in advance of recognizing the sale of certain products. We recognize advanced customer payments as a contract
liability in Customer advances and Other liabilities in Statement 3. Contract liabilities were $1,654 million, $1,680 million and
$1,868 million as of December 31, 2019, December 31, 2018 and January 1, 2018, respectively. We reduce the contract
liability when revenue is recognized. During 2019, we recognized $1,171 million of revenue that was recorded as a contract
liability at the beginning of 2019. During 2018, we recognized $1,294 million of revenue that was recorded as a contract
liability at the beginning of 2018.
We have elected the practical expedient to not adjust the amount of revenue to be recognized under a contract with a dealer or
end user for the effects of time value of money when the timing difference between receipt of payment and recognition of
revenue is less than one year.
As of December 31, 2019, we have entered into contracts with dealers and end users for which sales have not been recognized
as we have not satisfied our performance obligations and transferred control of the products. The dollar amount of unsatisfied
performance obligations for contracts with an original duration greater than one year is $6.2 billion, of which $2.4 billion is
expected to be completed and revenue recognized in the twelve months following December 31, 2019. We have elected the
practical expedient to not disclose unsatisfied performance obligations with an original contract duration of one year or less.
Contracts with an original duration of one year or less are primarily sales to dealers for machinery, engines and replacement
parts.
Sales and other related taxes are excluded from the transaction price. Shipping and handling costs associated with outbound
freight after control over a product has transferred are accounted for as a fulfillment cost and are included in Cost of goods
sold.
We provide a standard manufacturer’s warranty of our products at no additional cost. At the time a sale is recognized, we
record estimated future warranty costs. See Note 21 for further discussion of our product warranty liabilities.
See Note 23 for further disaggregated sales and revenues information.
B. Revenues of Financial Products
Revenues of Financial Products are generated primarily from finance revenue on finance receivables and rental payments on
operating leases. Finance revenue is recorded over the life of the related finance receivable using the interest method, including
the accretion of certain direct origination costs that are deferred. Revenue from rental payments received on operating leases is
recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Recognition of finance revenue and rental revenue is suspended and the account is placed on non-accrual status when
management determines that collection of future income is not probable (generally after 120 days past due). Recognition is
resumed, and previously suspended income is recognized, when the account becomes current and collection of remaining
amounts is considered probable. See Note 7 for more information.
Revenues are presented net of sales and other related taxes.
3.Stock-based compensation
 
Our stock-based compensation plans primarily provide for the granting of stock options, stock-settled stock appreciation rights
(SARs), restricted stock units (RSUs) and performance-based restricted stock units (PRSUs) to Officers and other key
employees, as well as non-employee Directors. Stock options permit a holder to buy Caterpillar stock at the stock’s price when
the option was granted. SARs permit a holder the right to receive the value in shares of the appreciation in Caterpillar stock
that occurred from the date the right was granted up to the date of exercise.  RSUs are agreements to issue shares of Caterpillar
stock at the time of vesting. PRSUs are similar to RSUs and include performance conditions in the vesting terms of the award.
 
79
Table of Contents
Our long-standing practices and policies specify that all stock-based compensation awards are approved by the Compensation
Committee (the Committee) of the Board of Directors.  The award approval process specifies the grant date, value and terms of
the award.  The same terms and conditions are consistently applied to all employee grants, including Officers. The Committee
approves all individual Officer grants.  The number of stock-based compensation award units included in an individual’s award
is determined based on the methodology approved by the Committee.  The exercise price methodology approved by the
Committee is the closing price of the Company stock on the date of the grant. In June of 2014, shareholders approved the
Caterpillar Inc. 2014 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the Plan) under which all new stock-based compensation awards are granted.
In June of 2017, the Plan was amended and restated. The Plan initially provided that up to 38,800,000 Common Shares would
be reserved for future issuance under the Plan, subject to adjustment in certain events. Subsequent to the shareholder approval
of the amendment and restatement of the Plan, an additional 36,000,000 Common Shares became available for all awards
under the Plan.
 
Common stock issued from Treasury stock under the plans totaled 5,126,379 for 2019, 5,590,641 for 2018 and 11,139,748 for
2017. The total number of shares authorized for equity awards under the amended and restated Caterpillar Inc. 2014 Long-
Term Incentive Plan is 74,800,000, of which 40,754,720 shares remained available for issuance as of December 31, 2019.
 
Stock option and RSU awards generally vest according to a three-year graded vesting schedule. One-third of the award will
become vested on the first anniversary of the grant date, one-third of the award will become vested on the second anniversary
of the grant date and one-third of the award will become vested on the third anniversary of the grant date. PRSU awards
generally have a three-year performance period and cliff vest at the end of the period based upon achievement of performance
targets established at the time of grant.
Upon separation from service, if the participant is 55 years of age or older with more than five years of service, the participant
meets the criteria for a “Long Service Separation.”  Award terms for stock option and RSU grants allow for continued vesting
as of each vesting date specified in the award document for employees who meet the criteria for a “Long Service Separation”
and fulfill a requisite service period of six months.  Compensation expense for eligible employees for the grants was
recognized over the period from the grant date to the end date of the six-month requisite service period.  For employees who
become eligible for a “Long Service Separation” subsequent to the end date of the six-month requisite service period and prior
to the completion of the vesting period, compensation expense is recognized over the period from the grant date to the date
eligibility is achieved.
  
For PRSU awards granted in 2018 and 2017, only a prorated number of shares may vest at the end of the performance period
based upon achievement of the performance target, with the proration based upon the number of months of continuous
employment during the three-year performance period.  Employees with a “Long Service Separation” must also fulfill a six-
month requisite service period in order to be eligible for the prorated vesting of outstanding PRSU awards granted in 2018 and
2017.  Compensation expense for the 2018 and 2017 PRSU grants is being recognized on a straight-line basis over the three-
year performance period for all participants. Award terms for the 2019 PRSU grant allowed for continued vesting upon
achievement of the performance target specified in the award document for employees who meet the criteria for a “Long
Service Separation” and fulfill a requisite service period of six months. Compensation expense for the 2019 PRSU grant with
respect to employees who have met the criteria for a “Long Service Separation” is recognized over the period from the grant
date to the end of the six-month requisite service period. For employees who become eligible for a “Long Service Separation”
subsequent to the end date of the six-month requisite service period and prior to the completion of the vesting period,
compensation expense is recognized over the period from the grant date to the date eligibility is achieved.
 
At grant, option awards and SARs have a term life of ten years.  For awards granted prior to 2016, if the “Long Service
Separation” criteria are met, the vested options/SARs have a life that is the lesser of ten years from the original grant date or
five years from the separation date.  For awards granted beginning in 2016, the vested options have a life equal to ten years
from the original grant date.
Accounting guidance on share-based payments requires companies to estimate the fair value of options/SARs on the date of
grant using an option-pricing model.  The fair value of our option/SAR grants was estimated using a lattice-based option-
pricing model.  The lattice-based option-pricing model considers a range of assumptions related to volatility, risk-free interest
rate and historical employee behavior.  Expected volatility was based on historical Caterpillar stock price movement and
current implied volatilities from traded options on Caterpillar stock. The risk-free interest rate was based on U.S. Treasury
security yields at the time of grant.  The weighted-average dividend yield was based on historical information.  The expected
life was determined from the lattice-based model. The lattice-based model incorporated exercise and post vesting forfeiture
assumptions based on analysis of historical data. The following table provides the assumptions used in determining the fair
value of the Option awards for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

Beginning with the 2018 grant, RSU and PRSU awards are credited with dividend equivalent units on each date that a cash
dividend is paid to holders of Common Stock. The fair value of the RSU and PRSU awards granted in 2019 and 2018 was
determined as the closing stock price on the date of the grant. Prior to 2018, RSU and PRSU awards were not credited with
dividend equivalent units and the fair value was determined by reducing the stock price on the date of the grant by the present
value of the estimated dividends to be paid during the vesting period. The estimated dividends were based on Caterpillar’s
quarterly divided per share at the time of the grant.

The computations of weighted-average exercise prices and aggregate intrinsic values are not applicable to RSUs or PRSUs
since these awards represent an agreement to issue shares of stock at the time of vesting.  At December 31, 2019, there were
1,369,203 outstanding RSUs with a weighted average remaining contractual life of 1.5 years and 670,115 outstanding PRSUs
with a weighted-average remaining contractual life of 1.5 years.

1 Based on the grant date fair value.
2 Based on the underlying stock’s closing market price on the vesting date.
In accordance with guidance on share-based payments, stock-based compensation expense is based on the grant date fair value
and is classified within Cost of goods sold, Selling, general and administrative expenses and Research and development
expenses corresponding to the same line item as the cash compensation paid to respective employees, officers and non-
employee directors. Stock-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period
for awards with terms that specify cliff or graded vesting and contain only service conditions. Stock-based compensation
expense for PRSUs is based on the probable number of shares expected to vest and is recognized primarily on a straight-line
basis.
Before tax, stock-based compensation expense for 2019, 2018 and 2017 was $205 million, $197 million and $206 million,
respectively, with a corresponding income tax benefit of $35 million, $36 million and $40 million, respectively.
The amount of stock-based compensation expense capitalized for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 did not
have a significant impact on our financial statements.
 
At December 31, 2019, there was $161 million of total unrecognized compensation cost from stock-based compensation
arrangements granted under the plans, which is related to non-vested stock-based awards.  The compensation expense is
expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 1.6 years.
We currently use shares in treasury stock to satisfy share award exercises.
 
The cash tax benefits realized from stock awards exercised for 2019, 2018 and 2017 were $89 million, $103 million and $205
million, respectively. We use the direct only method and tax law ordering approach to calculate the tax effects of stock-based
compensation. 
 
4.Derivative financial instruments and risk management
 
Our earnings and cash flow are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and
commodity prices.  Our Risk Management Policy (policy) allows for the use of derivative financial instruments to prudently
manage foreign currency exchange rate, interest rate and commodity price exposures.  Our policy specifies that derivatives are
not to be used for speculative purposes.  Derivatives that we use are primarily foreign currency forward, option and cross
currency contracts, interest rate contracts and commodity forward and option contracts.  Our derivative activities are subject to
the management, direction and control of our senior financial officers.  Risk management practices, including the use of
financial derivative instruments, are presented to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors at least annually.
 
83
Table of Contents
All derivatives are recognized in Statement 3 at their fair value. On the date the derivative contract is entered into, we
designate the derivative as (1) a hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability (fair value hedge), (2) a hedge of a
forecasted transaction or the variability of cash flow (cash flow hedge) or (3) an undesignated instrument. Changes in the fair
value of a derivative that is qualified, designated and highly effective as a fair value hedge, along with the gain or loss on the
hedged recognized asset or liability that is attributable to the hedged risk, are recorded in current earnings. Changes in the fair
value of a derivative that is qualified, designated and highly effective as a cash flow hedge are recorded in Accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI), to the extent effective, in Statement 3 until they are reclassified to earnings in the same
period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings.  Changes in the fair value of undesignated derivative
instruments are reported in current earnings. Cash flows from designated derivative financial instruments are classified within
the same category as the item being hedged on Statement 5.  Cash flows from undesignated derivative financial instruments are
included in the investing category on Statement 5.
 
We formally document all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as the risk-management
objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions.  This process includes linking all derivatives that are
designated as fair value hedges to specific assets and liabilities in Statement 3 and linking cash flow hedges to specific
forecasted transactions or variability of cash flow.
 
We also formally assess, both at the hedge’s inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the designated derivatives that are
used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flow of hedged items.  When a
derivative is determined not to be highly effective as a hedge or the underlying hedged transaction is no longer probable, we
discontinue hedge accounting prospectively, in accordance with the derecognition criteria for hedge accounting.
 
A.Foreign currency exchange rate risk
 
Foreign currency exchange rate movements create a degree of risk by affecting the U.S. dollar value of sales made and costs
incurred in foreign currencies. Movements in foreign currency rates also affect our competitive position as these changes may
affect business practices and/or pricing strategies of non-U.S.-based competitors. Additionally, we have balance sheet positions
denominated in foreign currencies, thereby creating exposure to movements in exchange rates.
 
Our ME&T operations purchase, manufacture and sell products in many locations around the world. As we have a diversified
revenue and cost base, we manage our future foreign currency cash flow exposure on a net basis. We use foreign currency
forward and option contracts to manage unmatched foreign currency cash inflow and outflow. Our objective is to minimize the
risk of exchange rate movements that would reduce the U.S. dollar value of our foreign currency cash flow. Our policy allows
for managing anticipated foreign currency cash flow for up to approximately five years. As of December 31, 2019, the
maximum term of these outstanding contracts was approximately 60 months.
 
We generally designate as cash flow hedges at inception of the contract any Australian dollar, Brazilian real, British pound,
Canadian dollar, Chinese yuan, Indian rupee, Japanese yen, Mexican peso, Singapore dollar or Thailand baht forward or option
contracts that meet the requirements for hedge accounting and the maturity extends beyond the current quarter-end.
Designation is performed on a specific exposure basis to support hedge accounting. The remainder of ME&T foreign currency
contracts are undesignated.
 
As of December 31, 2019, $1 million of deferred net losses, net of tax, included in equity (AOCI in Statement 3), are expected
to be reclassified to current earnings (Other income (expense) in Statement 1) over the next twelve months when earnings are
affected by the hedged transactions.  The actual amount recorded in Other income (expense) will vary based on exchange rates
at the time the hedged transactions impact earnings.
 
In managing foreign currency risk for our Financial Products operations, our objective is to minimize earnings volatility
resulting from conversion and the remeasurement of net foreign currency balance sheet positions and future transactions
denominated in foreign currencies. Our policy allows the use of foreign currency forward, option and cross currency contracts
to offset the risk of currency mismatch between our assets and liabilities and exchange rate risk associated with future
transactions denominated in foreign currencies. Our foreign currency forward and option contracts are primarily undesignated.
We designate fixed-to-fixed cross currency contracts as cash flow hedges to protect against movements in exchange rates on
foreign currency fixed-rate assets and liabilities.
 
B.Interest rate risk
 
Interest rate movements create a degree of risk by affecting the amount of our interest payments and the value of our fixed-rate
debt. Our practice is to use interest rate contracts to manage our exposure to interest rate changes.
84
Table of Contents
 
Our ME&T operations generally use fixed-rate debt as a source of funding.  Our objective is to minimize the cost of borrowed
funds.  Our policy allows us to enter into fixed-to-floating interest rate contracts and forward rate agreements to meet that
objective. We designate fixed-to-floating interest rate contracts as fair value hedges at inception of the contract, and we
designate certain forward rate agreements as cash flow hedges at inception of the contract.
Financial Products operations has a match-funding policy that addresses interest rate risk by aligning the interest rate profile
(fixed or floating rate and duration) of Cat Financial’s debt portfolio with the interest rate profile of our receivables portfolio
within predetermined ranges on an ongoing basis. In connection with that policy, we use interest rate derivative instruments to
modify the debt structure to match assets within the receivables portfolio. This matched funding reduces the volatility of
margins between interest-bearing assets and interest-bearing liabilities, regardless of which direction interest rates move.
 
Our policy allows us to use fixed-to-floating, floating-to-fixed and floating-to-floating interest rate contracts to meet the match-
funding objective.  We designate fixed-to-floating interest rate contracts as fair value hedges to protect debt against changes in
fair value due to changes in the benchmark interest rate.  We designate most floating-to-fixed interest rate contracts as cash
flow hedges to protect against the variability of cash flows due to changes in the benchmark interest rate.
We have, at certain times, liquidated fixed-to-floating and floating-to-fixed interest rate contracts at both ME&T and Financial
Products.  The gains or losses associated with these contracts at the time of liquidation are amortized into earnings over the
original term of the previously designated hedged item.
 
C.Commodity price risk
 
Commodity price movements create a degree of risk by affecting the price we must pay for certain raw materials. Our policy is
to use commodity forward and option contracts to manage the commodity risk and reduce the cost of purchased materials.
 
Our ME&T operations purchase base and precious metals embedded in the components we purchase from suppliers.  Our
suppliers pass on to us price changes in the commodity portion of the component cost. In addition, we are subject to price
changes on energy products such as natural gas and diesel fuel purchased for operational use.
 
Our objective is to minimize volatility in the price of these commodities. Our policy allows us to enter into commodity forward
and option contracts to lock in the purchase price of a portion of these commodities within a five-year horizon. All such
commodity forward and option contracts are undesignated.

We enter into International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) master netting agreements within ME&T and Financial
Products that permit the net settlement of amounts owed under their respective derivative contracts. Under these master netting
agreements, net settlement generally permits the company or the counterparty to determine the net amount payable for
contracts due on the same date and in the same currency for similar types of derivative transactions. The master netting
agreements generally also provide for net settlement of all outstanding contracts with a counterparty in the case of an event of
default or a termination event.
Collateral is generally not required of the counterparties or of our company under the master netting agreements. As of
December 31, 2019 and 2018, no cash collateral was received or pledged under the master netting agreements.

Included in the line item above labeled “Non-U.S. subsidiaries taxed at other than the U.S. rate” are the effects of local and
U.S. taxes related to earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries, changes in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits associated with
these earnings, losses at non-U.S. subsidiaries without local tax benefits due to valuation allowances and other permanent
differences between tax and U.S. GAAP results. Although not individually significant by jurisdiction, pre-tax permanent
differences due to nondeductible net foreign exchange gains/losses of non-U.S. subsidiaries were approximately $36 million of
net losses in 2019, $180 million of net losses in 2018 and $160 million of net gains in 2017.
Included in the line item above labeled “Valuation allowances” are decreases in the valuation allowance for U.S. state deferred
tax assets resulting in a $63 million non-cash benefit in 2018, net of federal deferred tax adjustment at 21 percent, compared to
a $111 million non-cash benefit in 2017, net of federal deferred tax adjustment at 35 percent. The primary driver of the
decreases in the U.S. state valuation allowance was improved U.S. GAAP profits expected to recur in certain state

Also included in 2018 was a decrease in the valuation allowance for a non-U.S. subsidiary of $25 million offset by a charge of
$59 million to correct for an error which resulted in an understatement of the valuation allowance offsetting deferred tax assets
for prior years. This error had the effect of overstating profit by $17 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.
Management has concluded that the error was not material to any period presented.
On December 22, 2017, U.S. tax legislation was enacted containing a broad range of tax reform provisions including a
corporate tax rate reduction and changes in the U.S. taxation of non-U.S. earnings. In 2018, measurement period adjustments
of $104 million reduced the provisionally estimated charge of $2.371 billion recognized during the fourth quarter of 2017. A
$154 million benefit revised the estimated impact of the write-down of U.S. net deferred tax assets to reflect the reduction in
the U.S. corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent. This benefit primarily related to the decision to make an additional
discretionary pension contribution of $1.0 billion to U.S. pension plans in 2018 which was treated as deductible on the 2017
U.S. tax return. A $50 million charge revised the estimated cost of a mandatory deemed repatriation of non-U.S. earnings,
including changes in the deferred tax liability related to the amount of earnings considered not indefinitely reinvested as well
as the amount of unrecognized tax benefits and state tax liabilities associated with these tax positions. During 2019, a $178
million tax benefit was recorded to adjust previously unrecognized tax benefits as a result of receipt of additional guidance
related to the calculation of the mandatory deemed repatriation of non-U.S. earnings.
As a result of U.S. tax reform legislation, distributions of profits from non-U.S. subsidiaries are not expected to cause a
significant incremental U.S. tax impact in the future. However, these distributions may be subject to non-U.S. withholding
taxes if profits are distributed from certain jurisdictions. Undistributed profits of non-U.S. subsidiaries of approximately $14
billion are considered indefinitely reinvested. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability related to
indefinitely reinvested profits is not feasible primarily due to our legal entity structure and the complexity of U.S. and local tax
laws.

Profit before taxes, as shown above, is based on the location of the entity to which such earnings are attributable. Where an
entity’s earnings are subject to taxation, however, may not correlate solely to where an entity is located.  Thus, the income tax

At December 31, 2019, approximately $1,320 million of U.S. state tax net operating losses (NOLs) and $125 million of U.S.
state tax credit carryforwards were available. The state NOLs primarily expire over the next twenty years.  The state tax credit
carryforwards primarily expire over the next fifteen years, with some credits having an unlimited carryforward period. In total,
we have established a valuation allowance of $172 million related to certain of these carryforwards.
At December 31, 2019, approximately $264 million of U.S. foreign tax credits were available for carryforward. These credits
expire in 2028.

We classify interest and penalties on income taxes as a component of the provision for income taxes. We recognized a net
provision for interest and penalties of $43 million, $42 million and $38 million during the years ended December 31, 2019,
2018 and 2017, respectively. The total amount of interest and penalties accrued was $233 million and $190 million as of
December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
 
On January 31, 2018, we received a Revenue Agent’s Report from the IRS indicating the end of the field examination of our
U.S. income tax returns for 2010 to 2012. In the audits of 2007 to 2012 including the impact of a loss carryback to 2005, the
IRS has proposed to tax in the United States profits earned from certain parts transactions by Caterpillar SARL (CSARL),
based on the IRS examination team’s application of the “substance-over-form” or “assignment-of-income” judicial doctrines.
We are vigorously contesting the proposed increases to tax and penalties for these years of approximately $2.3 billion. We
believe that the relevant transactions complied with applicable tax laws and did not violate judicial doctrines. We have filed
U.S. income tax returns on this same basis for years after 2012. Based on the information currently available, we do not
anticipate a significant change to our unrecognized tax benefits for this position within the next 12 months. We currently
believe the ultimate disposition of this matter will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position,
liquidity or results of operations.
With the exception of a loss carryback to 2005, tax years prior to 2007 are generally no longer subject to U.S. tax assessment.
In our major non-U.S. jurisdictions including Australia, Brazil, China, Germany, India, Japan, Mexico, Switzerland, Singapore
and the U.K., tax years are typically subject to examination for three to ten years. Due to the uncertainty related to the timing
and potential outcome of audits, we cannot estimate the range of reasonably possible change in unrecognized tax benefits in
the next 12 months.

C.Allowance for credit losses
 
The allowance for credit losses is an estimate of the losses inherent in Cat Financial’s finance receivable portfolio and includes
consideration of accounts that have been individually identified as impaired, as well as pools of finance receivables where it is
probable that certain receivables in the pool are impaired but the individual accounts cannot yet be identified.   In identifying
and measuring impairment, management takes into consideration past loss experience, known and inherent risks in the
portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrower’s ability to repay, estimated value of underlying collateral and current
economic conditions.  
Accounts are identified for individual review based on past-due status and information available about the customer, such as
financial statements, news reports and published credit ratings, as well as general information regarding industry trends and the
economic environment in which Cat Financial’s customers operate. The allowance for credit losses attributable to finance
receivables that are individually evaluated and determined to be impaired is based on the present value of expected future cash
flows discounted at the receivables’ effective interest rate, the fair value of the collateral for collateral-dependent receivables or
the observable market price of the receivable.  In determining collateral value, Cat Financial estimates the current fair market
value of the collateral less selling costs. Cat Financial also considers credit enhancements such as additional collateral and
contractual third-party guarantees. The allowance for credit losses attributable to the remaining accounts not yet individually
identified as impaired is estimated based on loss forecast models utilizing probabilities of default, our estimate of the loss
emergence period and the estimated loss given default.  In addition, qualitative factors not able to be fully captured in the loss
forecast models including industry trends, macroeconomic factors and model imprecision are considered in the evaluation of
the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses.  These qualitative factors are subjective and require a degree of management
judgment.
Cat Financial’s allowance for credit losses is segregated into two portfolio segments:
 
• Customer - Finance receivables with end-user customers.
• Dealer - Finance receivables with Caterpillar dealers.
A portfolio segment is the level at which the Company develops a systematic methodology for determining its allowance for
credit losses.
 
Cat Financial further evaluates portfolio segments by the class of finance receivables, which is defined as a level of
information (below a portfolio segment) in which the finance receivables have the same initial measurement attribute and a
similar method for assessing and monitoring credit risk.  Typically, Cat Financial’s finance receivables within a geographic
area have similar credit risk profiles and methods for assessing and monitoring credit risk.  Cat Financial’s classes, which align
with management reporting for credit losses, are as follows:
 
• North America - Finance receivables originated in the United States and Canada.
• EAME - Finance receivables originated in Europe, Africa, Middle East and the Commonwealth of Independent
States.
• Asia Pacific - Finance receivables originated in Australia, New Zealand, China, Japan, Southeast Asia and India.
• Mining - Finance receivables related to large mining customers worldwide.
• Latin America - Finance receivables originated in Mexico and Central and South American countries.
• Caterpillar Power Finance - Finance receivables originated worldwide related to marine vessels with Caterpillar
engines and Caterpillar electrical power generation, gas compression and co-generation systems and non-
Caterpillar equipment that is powered by these systems.

Credit quality of finance receivables
 
At origination, Cat Financial evaluates credit risk based on a variety of credit quality factors including prior payment
experience, customer financial information, credit-rating agency ratings, loan-to-value ratios and other internal metrics. On an
ongoing basis, Cat Financial monitors credit quality based on past-due status and collection experience as there is a meaningful
correlation between the past-due status of customers and the risk of loss.

Table of Contents
In determining past-due status, Cat Financial considers the entire recorded investment in finance receivable past due when any
installment is over 30 days past due. The tables below summarize the recorded investment of finance receivables by aging

Impaired finance receivables
 
For all classes, a finance receivable is considered impaired, based on current information and events, if it is probable that Cat
Financial will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms.  Impaired finance receivables include
finance receivables that have been restructured and are considered to be troubled debt restructurings.
 
There were $78 million of impaired finance receivables with a related allowance of $39 million and $14 million as of
December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, for the Dealer portfolio segment, all of which was in Latin America. There were no
impaired finance receivables as of December 31, 2017 for the Dealer portfolio segment.  Cat Financial’s recorded investment
in impaired finance receivables and the related unpaid principal balances and allowances for the Customer portfolio segment

Recognition of income is suspended and the finance receivable is placed on non-accrual status when management determines
that collection of future income is not probable (generally after 120 days past due).  Recognition is resumed and previously
suspended income is recognized when the finance receivable becomes current and collection of remaining amounts is
considered probable. Payments received while the finance receivable is on non-accrual status are applied to interest and
principal in accordance with the contractual terms.
 
As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, there were $78 million in finance receivables on non-accrual status for the Dealer
portfolio segment, all of which was in Latin America.

Troubled Debt Restructurings
 
A restructuring of a finance receivable constitutes a troubled debt restructuring (TDR) when the lender grants a concession it
would not otherwise consider to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties.  Concessions granted may include extended
contract maturities, inclusion of interest only periods, below market interest rates, extended skip payment periods and
reduction of principal and/or accrued interest.

8.Inventories
 
Inventories (principally using the LIFO method) are comprised of the following:
 
 December  31,
(Millions of dollars) 2019 2018
Raw materials $ 4,263 $ 4,477
Work-in-process 1,147 1,259
Finished goods 5,598 5,562
Supplies 258 231
Total inventories $ 11,266 $ 11,529
   
 
During the third quarter of 2019, changes were made to the classification of inventories primarily related to purchased parts
between Raw materials, Work-in-process and Finished goods. The prior year amounts have been retrospectively adjusted to
conform to the current-year classification.
During 2017, closure of our facility in Gosselies, Belgium resulted in a liquidation of LIFO inventory. The liquidated inventory
was carried at lower costs prevailing in prior years as compared with current costs. The effect of this reduction in inventory
decreased Cost of goods sold by approximately $66 million and increased Profit by approximately $49 million or $0.08 per
share. The impact of LIFO liquidations during 2019 and 2018 was not significant to Statement 1.
We had long-term material purchase obligations of approximately $270 million at December 31, 2019.

Downer Freight Rail, respectively. See Note 24 for details on these acquisitions.
Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives and tested for impairment if events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired.
Amortization expense related to intangible assets was $324 million, $331 million and $323 million for 2019, 2018 and 2017,
respectively.

11.Investments in debt and equity securities
 
We have investments in certain debt and equity securities, primarily at Insurance Services, which are recorded at fair value and
are primarily included in Other assets in Statement 3.
Debt securities have been classified as available-for-sale, and the unrealized gains and losses arising from the revaluation of
these debt securities are included, net of applicable deferred income taxes, in equity (Accumulated other comprehensive
income (loss) in Statement 3). The unrealized gains and losses arising from the revaluation of the equity securities are included
in Other income (expense) in Statement 1. Realized gains and losses on sales of investments are generally determined using the
specific identification method for debt and equity securities and are included in Other income (expense) in Statement 1.
The cost basis and fair value of debt securities with unrealized gains and losses included in equity (Accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss) in Statement 3) were as follows:

12.Postemployment benefit plans
 
We provide defined benefit pension plans, defined contribution plans and/or other postretirement benefit plans (retirement
health care and life insurance) to employees in many of our locations throughout the world. Our defined benefit pension plans
provide a benefit based on years of service and/or the employee’s average earnings near retirement. Our defined contribution
plans allow employees to contribute a portion of their salary to help save for retirement, and in most cases, we provide a
matching contribution. The benefit obligation related to our non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans are for employees located
primarily in Europe, Japan and Brazil. For other postretirement benefits (OPEB), substantially all of our benefit obligation is
for employees located in the United States.
 
Our U.S. defined benefit pension plans for support and management employees were frozen for certain employees on
December 31, 2010 and were frozen for the remaining employees on December 31, 2019. On the respective transition dates
employees move to a retirement benefit that provides a frozen pension benefit and a 401(k) plan that will include a matching
contribution and a new annual employer contribution.
In the first quarter of 2017, we announced the closure of our Gosselies, Belgium facility. This announcement impacted certain
employees that participated in a defined benefit pension plan and resulted in a net loss of $20 million in the first quarter of
2017 for curtailment and termination benefits.
All curtailments and termination benefits were recognized in Other income (expense) in Statement 1.

Rate of compensation increase 1—% 4.0% 2.0% 3.0% 4.0% 4.0%
       
1 Effective December 31, 2019, all U.S. pension benefits were frozen, and accordingly this assumption is no longer applicable.
The assumed discount rate is used to discount future benefit obligations back to today’s dollars.  The U.S. discount rate is
based on a benefit cash flow-matching approach and represents the rate at which our benefit obligations could effectively be
settled as of our measurement date, December 31.  The benefit cash flow-matching approach involves analyzing Caterpillar’s
projected cash flows against a high quality bond yield curve, calculated using a wide population of corporate Aa bonds
available on the measurement date.  A similar process is used to determine the assumed discount rate for our most significant
non-U.S. plans. This rate is sensitive to changes in interest rates. A decrease in the discount rate would increase our obligation
and future expense.

1 The estimated amount of prior service cost (credit) that will be amortized from Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) at December 31, 2019
into net periodic benefit cost (pre-tax) in 2020 is a credit of $38 million for Other Postretirement Benefits.
2 Actuarial loss (gain) represents the effects of actual results differing from our assumptions and the effects of changing assumptions. We recognize actuarial
loss (gain) immediately through earnings upon the annual remeasurement in the fourth quarter, or on an interim basis as triggering events warrant
remeasurement.
3 The service cost component is included in Operating costs and all other components are included in Other income (expense) in Statement 1.
4 The weighted-average rates for 2020 are 5.1 percent and 3.2 percent for U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans, respectively.
The discount rates used in the determination of our service and interest cost components are determined by utilizing a full yield
curve approach which applies specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the
relevant projected cash flows.
 
Our U.S. expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on our estimate of long-term passive returns for equities and
fixed income securities weighted by the allocation of our pension assets. Based on historical performance, we increase the
passive returns due to our active management of the plan assets. To arrive at our expected long-term return, the amount added
for active management was 0.40 percent for 2019, 0.75 percent for 2018 and 0.80 percent for 2017.  A similar process is used
to determine this rate for our non-U.S. plans.

The assumed health care trend rate represents the rate at which health care costs are assumed to increase. We assumed a
weighted-average increase of 6.1 percent in our calculation of 2019 benefit expense.  We expect a weighted-average increase
of 6.1 percent during 2020.  The 2020 rates are assumed to decrease gradually to the ultimate health care trend rate of 5 percent
in 2025. This rate represents 3 percent general inflation plus 2 percent additional health care inflation.
Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care plans. A one-
percentage-point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have had the following effects:

amounts expected to be received by the company which will offset other postretirement benefit payments.
D. Plan assets
In general, our strategy for both the U.S. and non-U.S. pensions includes ongoing alignment of our investments to our
liabilities, while reducing risk in our portfolio. The current U.S. pension target asset allocation is 70 percent fixed income and
30 percent equities. This target allocation will be revisited periodically to ensure it reflects our overall objectives. The non-U.S.
pension weighted-average target allocations are 79 percent fixed income, 12 percent equities, 5 percent real estate and 4
percent other.  The target allocations for each plan vary based upon local statutory requirements, demographics of plan
participants and funded status.  The non-U.S. plan assets are primarily invested in non-U.S. securities.
 
Our target allocation for the other postretirement benefit plans is 70 percent equities and 30 percent fixed income. 
 
The U.S. plans are rebalanced to within the appropriate target asset allocation ranges on a monthly basis.  The frequency of
rebalancing for the non-U.S. plans varies depending on the plan. As a result of our diversification strategies, there are no
significant concentrations of risk within the portfolio of investments.

The use of certain derivative instruments is permitted where appropriate and necessary for achieving overall investment policy
objectives.  The plans do not use derivative contracts for speculative purposes.
 
The accounting guidance on fair value measurements specifies a fair value hierarchy based upon the observability of inputs
used in valuation techniques (Level 1, 2 and 3).  See Note 18 for a discussion of the fair value hierarchy.
 
Fair values are determined as follows:
 
• Equity securities are primarily based on valuations for identical instruments in active markets.
• Fixed income securities are primarily based upon models that take into consideration such market-based factors
as recent sales, risk-free yield curves and prices of similarly rated bonds.
• Real estate is stated at the fund’s net asset value or at appraised value.
• Cash, short-term instruments and other are based on the carrying amount, which approximates fair value, or the
fund’s net asset value.
The fair value of the pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets by category is summarized below:

E. Defined contribution plans
 
We have both U.S. and non-U.S. employee defined contribution plans to help employees save for retirement. Our primary U.S.
401(k) plan allows eligible employees to contribute a portion of their cash compensation to the plan on a tax-deferred basis.
Employees with frozen defined benefit pension accruals are eligible for matching contributions equal to 100 percent of
employee contributions to the plan up to 6 percent of cash compensation and an annual employer contribution that ranges from
3 to 5 percent of cash compensation (depending on years of service and age). Employees that were still accruing benefits under
a defined benefit pension plan up to December 31, 2019 were eligible for matching contributions equal to 50 percent of
employee contributions up to 6 percent of cash compensation. All our U.S. defined benefit pension plans were frozen on
December 31, 2019 for remaining employees still accruing a benefit. Starting in 2020, these employees will receive matching
contributions equal to 100 percent of employee contributions to the plan up to 6 percent of cash compensation and an annual
employer contribution that ranges from 3 to 5 percent of cash compensation (depending on years of service and age).
116
These 401(k) plans include various investment funds, including a non-leveraged employee stock ownership plan (ESOP). As of
December 31, 2019 and 2018, the ESOP held 14.9 million and 17.2 million shares, respectively. All of the shares held by the
ESOP were allocated to participant accounts. Dividends paid to participants are automatically reinvested into company shares
unless the participant elects to have all or a portion of the dividend paid to the participant. Various other U.S. and non-U.S.
defined contribution plans generally allow eligible employees to contribute a portion of their cash compensation to the plans,
and in most cases, we provide a matching contribution to the funds.

We have three global credit facilities with a syndicate of banks totaling $10.50 billion (Credit Facility) available in the
aggregate to both Caterpillar and Cat Financial for general liquidity purposes.  Based on management's allocation decision,
which can be revised from time to time, the portion of the Credit Facility available to ME&T as of December 31, 2019 was
$2.75 billion. Information on our Credit Facility is as follows:
 
•The 364-day facility of $3.15 billion (of which $0.82 billion is available to ME&T) expires in September 2020.
•The three-year facility, as amended and restated in September 2019, of $2.73 billion (of which $0.72 billion is available to
ME&T) expires in September 2022.
•The five-year facility, as amended and restated in September 2019, of $4.62 billion (of which $1.21 billion is available to
ME&T) expires in September 2024.
Other consolidated credit lines with banks as of December 31, 2019 totaled $5.00 billion. These committed and uncommitted
credit lines, which may be eligible for renewal at various future dates or have no specified expiration date, are used primarily
by our subsidiaries for local funding requirements.  Caterpillar or Cat Financial may guarantee subsidiary borrowings under
these lines.
119
Table of Contents
At December 31, 2019, Caterpillar’s consolidated net worth was $14.63 billion, which was above the $9.00 billion required
under the Credit Facility.  The consolidated net worth is defined as the consolidated shareholders’ equity including preferred
stock but excluding the pension and other postretirement benefits balance within Accumulated other comprehensive income
(loss).
At December 31, 2019, Cat Financial’s covenant interest coverage ratio was 1.77 to 1.  This is above the 1.15 to 1 minimum
ratio, calculated as (1) profit excluding income taxes, interest expense and net gain/(loss) from interest rate derivatives to
(2) interest expense calculated at the end of each calendar quarter for the rolling four quarter period then most recently ended,
required by the Credit Facility.
In addition, at December 31, 2019, Cat Financial’s six-month covenant leverage ratio was 7.65 to 1 and year-end covenant
leverage ratio was 7.46 to 1.  This is below the maximum ratio of debt to net worth of 10 to 1, calculated (1) on a monthly
basis as the average of the leverage ratios determined on the last day of each of the six preceding calendar months and (2) at
each December 31, required by the Credit Facility.
In the event Caterpillar or Cat Financial does not meet one or more of their respective financial covenants under the Credit
Facility in the future (and are unable to obtain a consent or waiver), the syndicate of banks may terminate the commitments
allocated to the party that does not meet its covenants.  Additionally, in such event, certain of Cat Financial’s other lenders
under other loan agreements where similar financial covenants or cross default provisions are applicable may, at their election,
choose to pursue remedies under those loan agreements, including accelerating the repayment of outstanding borrowings.  At
December 31, 2019, there were no borrowings under the Credit Facility.

For the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, 3.0 million and 1.5 million outstanding stock options, respectively, were
excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share because the effect would have been antidilutive. For 2017, no
outstanding SARs and stock options were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share because all outstanding
SARs and stock options had a dilutive effect.
In July 2018, the Board approved a new share repurchase authorization of up to $10.0 billion of Caterpillar common stock
effective January 1, 2019, with no expiration.
During 2019 and 2018, we repurchased 30.6 million and 27.7 million shares of Caterpillar common stock, respectively, at an
aggregate cost of $4.0 billion and $3.8 billion, respectively. These purchases were made through a combination of accelerated
stock repurchase agreements with third-party financial institutions and open market transactions.
 
We did not repurchase any Caterpillar common stock during 2017.

18.Fair value disclosures
 
A.Fair value measurements
 
The guidance on fair value measurements defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to
transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction
between market participants.  This guidance also specifies a fair value hierarchy based upon the observability of inputs used in
valuation techniques.  Observable inputs (highest level) reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while
unobservable inputs (lowest level) reflect internally developed market assumptions.  In accordance with this guidance, fair
value measurements are classified under the following hierarchy:
 
•Level 1 – Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.
•Level 2 – Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in
markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs or significant value-drivers are
observable in active markets.
•Level 3 – Model-derived valuations in which one or more significant inputs or significant value-drivers are unobservable.
 
When available, we use quoted market prices to determine fair value, and we classify such measurements within Level 1.  In
some cases where market prices are not available, we make use of observable market based inputs to calculate fair value, in
which case the measurements are classified within Level 2.  If quoted or observable market prices are not available, fair value
is based upon valuations in which one or more significant inputs are unobservable, including internally developed models that
use, where possible, current market-based parameters such as interest rates, yield curves and currency rates.  These
measurements are classified within Level 3.
Fair value measurements are classified according to the lowest level input or value-driver that is significant to the valuation.  A
measurement may therefore be classified within Level 3 even though there may be significant inputs that are readily
observable.
 
Fair value measurement includes the consideration of nonperformance risk.  Nonperformance risk refers to the risk that an
obligation (either by a counterparty or Caterpillar) will not be fulfilled.  For financial assets traded in an active market (Level 1
and certain Level 2), the nonperformance risk is included in the market price.  For certain other financial assets and liabilities
(certain Level 2 and Level 3), our fair value calculations have been adjusted accordingly.
 
Investments in debt and equity securities
We have investments in certain debt and equity securities, primarily at Insurance Services, that are recorded at fair value.  Fair
values for our U.S. treasury bonds and large capitalization value and smaller company growth equity securities are based upon
valuations for identical instruments in active markets.  Fair values for other government bonds, corporate bonds and mortgage-
backed debt securities are based upon models that take into consideration such market-based factors as recent sales, risk-free
yield curves and prices of similarly rated bonds.
 
In addition, Insurance Services has an equity investment in a real estate investment trust (REIT) which is recorded at fair value
based on the net asset value (NAV) of the investment and is not classified within the fair value hierarchy.
See Note 11 for additional information on our investments in debt and equity securities.
 
Derivative financial instruments
The fair value of interest rate contracts is primarily based on models that utilize the appropriate market-based forward swap
curves and zero-coupon interest rates to determine discounted cash flows.  The fair value of foreign currency and commodity
forward, option and cross currency contracts is based on a valuation model that discounts cash flows resulting from the
differential between the contract price and the market-based forward rate.

In addition to the amounts above, Cat Financial impaired loans are subject to measurement at fair value on a nonrecurring basis
and are classified as Level 3 measurements. A loan is considered impaired when management determines that collection of
contractual amounts due is not probable.  In these cases, an allowance for credit losses may be established based either on the
present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the receivables’ effective interest rate, the fair value of the collateral
for collateral-dependent receivables, or the observable market price of the receivable.  In determining collateral value, Cat
Financial estimates the current fair market value of the collateral less selling costs. Cat Financial had impaired loans with a fair
value of $343 million and $469 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.  
 
B.Fair values of financial instruments
 
In addition to the methods and assumptions we use to record the fair value of financial instruments as discussed in the Fair
value measurements section above, we used the following methods and assumptions to estimate the fair value of our financial
instruments:
 
Cash and short-term investments
Carrying amount approximated fair value.
 
Restricted cash and short-term investments
Carrying amount approximated fair value.  Restricted cash and short-term investments are included in Prepaid expenses and
other current assets in Statement 3.
 
125
Table of Contents
Finance receivables
Fair value was estimated by discounting the future cash flows using current rates, representative of receivables with similar
remaining maturities.
 
Wholesale inventory receivables
Fair value was estimated by discounting the future cash flows using current rates, representative of receivables with similar
remaining maturities.
 
Short-term borrowings
Carrying amount approximated fair value.
 
Long-term debt
Fair value for fixed and floating rate debt was estimated based on quoted market prices.
Guarantees
The fair value of guarantees is based upon our estimate of the premium a market participant would require to issue the same
guarantee in a stand-alone arms-length transaction with an unrelated party. If quoted or observable market prices are not
available, fair value is based upon internally developed models that utilize current market-based assumptions.

19.Concentration of credit risk
 
Financial instruments with potential credit risk consist primarily of trade and finance receivables and short-term and long-term
investments. Additionally, to a lesser extent, we have a potential credit risk associated with counterparties to derivative
contracts.
 
126
Table of Contents
Trade receivables are primarily short-term receivables from independently owned and operated dealers and customers which
arise in the normal course of business. We perform regular credit evaluations of our dealers and customers. Collateral generally
is not required, and the majority of our trade receivables are unsecured. We do, however, when deemed necessary, make use of
various devices such as security agreements and letters of credit to protect our interests. No single dealer or customer
represents a significant concentration of credit risk.
 
Finance receivables and wholesale inventory receivables primarily represent receivables under installment sales contracts,
receivables arising from leasing transactions and notes receivable. We generally maintain a secured interest in the equipment
financed. No single customer or dealer represents a significant concentration of credit risk.
 
Short-term and long-term investments are held with high quality institutions and, by policy, the amount of credit exposure to
any one institution is limited. Long-term investments, primarily included in Other assets in Statement 3, are comprised
primarily of available-for-sale debt securities and equity securities at Insurance Services.
 
For derivative contracts, collateral is generally not required of the counterparties or of our company.  The company generally
enters into International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) master netting agreements within ME&T and Financial
Products that permit the net settlement of amounts owed under their respective derivative contracts.  Our exposure to credit
loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties is limited to only those gains that we have recorded, but for which
we have not yet received cash payment. The master netting agreements reduce the amount of loss the company would incur
should the counterparties fail to meet their obligations.  At December 31, 2019 and 2018, the maximum exposure to credit loss
was $116 million and $131 million, respectively, before the application of any master netting agreements.  
Please refer to Note 18 and Table III above for fair value information.
 
20.Leases
 
A. Lessee arrangements
We lease certain property, information technology equipment, warehouse equipment, vehicles and other equipment through
operating leases. We recognize a lease liability and corresponding right-of-use asset based on the present value of lease
payments. To determine the present value of lease payments for most of our leases, we use our incremental borrowing rate
based on information available on the lease commencement date. For certain property and information technology equipment
leases, we have elected to separate payments for lease components from non-lease components. For all other leases, we have
elected not to separate payments for lease and non-lease components. Our lease agreements may include options to extend or
terminate the lease. When it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option, we have included the option in the
recognition of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. We have elected not to recognize right-of-use assets or lease liabilities
for leases with a term of twelve months or less.
Our finance leases are not significant and therefore are not included in the following disclosures.
The components of lease costs were as follows:
(Millions of dollars)

B. Lessor arrangements
We lease Caterpillar machinery, engines and other equipment to customers and dealers around the world, primarily through Cat
Financial. Cat Financial leases to customers primarily through sales-type (non-tax) leases, where the lessee for tax purposes is
considered to be the owner of the equipment during the term of the lease. Cat Financial also offers tax leases that are classified
as either operating or direct finance leases for financial accounting purposes, depending on the characteristics of the lease. For
tax purposes, Cat Financial is considered the owner of the equipment. Our lease agreements may include options for the lessee
to purchase the underlying asset at the end of the lease term for either a stated fixed price or fair market value.
The residual value of Cat Financial’s leased equipment is determined based on its estimated end-of-term market value.  We
estimate the residual value of leased equipment at the inception of the lease based on a number of factors, including historical
wholesale market sales prices, past remarketing experience and any known significant market/product trends.  The following
critical factors are also considered in our residual value estimates: lease term, market size and demand, total expected hours of
usage, machine configuration, application, location, model changes, quantities, third-party residual guarantees and contractual
customer purchase options.
During the term of our leases, we monitor residual values.  For operating leases, adjustments to depreciation expense reflecting
changes in residual value estimates are recorded prospectively on a straight-line basis.  For finance leases, residual value
adjustments are recognized through a reduction of finance revenue over the remaining lease term.
See Note 7 for contractual maturities of finance lease receivables (sales-type and direct finance leases).

21.Guarantees and product warranty
 
Caterpillar dealer performance guarantees
We have provided an indemnity to a third-party insurance company for potential losses related to performance bonds issued on
behalf of Caterpillar dealers.  The bonds have varying terms and are issued to insure governmental agencies against
nonperformance by certain dealers.  We also provided guarantees to third-parties related to the performance of contractual
obligations by certain Caterpillar dealers. These guarantees have varying terms and cover potential financial losses incurred by
the third parties resulting from the dealers’ nonperformance.
In 2016, we provided a guarantee to an end user related to the performance of contractual obligations by a Caterpillar dealer.
Under the guarantee, which expires in 2025, non-performance by the Caterpillar dealer could require Caterpillar to satisfy the
contractual obligations by providing goods, services or financial compensation to the end user up to an annual designated cap.
Supplier consortium performance guarantees
We have provided guarantees to a customer in Brazil and a customer in Europe related to the performance of contractual
obligations by supplier consortiums to which our Caterpillar subsidiaries are members. The guarantees cover potential
damages incurred by the customers resulting from the supplier consortiums’ non-performance. The damages are capped except
for failure of the consortiums to meet certain obligations outlined in the contract in the normal course of business. The
guarantee for the customer in Europe will expire when the supplier consortium performs all of its contractual obligations,
which are expected to be completed in 2022. The agreement with the customer in Brazil was terminated during second quarter
of 2019. No payments were made under the guarantee.
We have dealer performance guarantees and third-party performance guarantees that do not limit potential payment to end
users related to indemnities and other commercial contractual obligations. In addition, we have entered into contracts involving
industry standard indemnifications that do not limit potential payment. For these unlimited guarantees, we are unable to
estimate a maximum potential amount of future payments that could result from claims made.
130
Table of Contents
No significant loss has been experienced or is anticipated under any of these guarantees. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, the
related recorded liability was $5 million and $8 million, respectively. The maximum potential amount of future payments
(undiscounted and without reduction for any amounts that may possibly be recovered under recourse or collateralized
provisions) we could be required to make under the guarantees at December 31 are as follows:
 
(Millions of dollars) 2019  2018
Caterpillar dealer performance guarantees $ 1,150  $ 1,244
Supplier consortium performance guarantees 238  527
Other guarantees 221  207
Total guarantees $ 1,609  $ 1,978
    
 
Cat Financial provides guarantees to repurchase certain loans of Caterpillar dealers from a special-purpose corporation (SPC)
that qualifies as a variable interest entity.  The purpose of the SPC is to provide short-term working capital loans to Caterpillar
dealers.  This SPC issues commercial paper and uses the proceeds to fund its loan program.  Cat Financial has a loan purchase
agreement with the SPC that obligates Cat Financial to purchase certain loans that are not paid at maturity.  Cat Financial
receives a fee for providing this guarantee, which provides a source of liquidity for the SPC.  Cat Financial is the primary
beneficiary of the SPC as its guarantees result in Cat Financial having both the power to direct the activities that most
significantly impact the SPC’s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses, and therefore Cat Financial has
consolidated the financial statements of the SPC.  As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the SPC’s assets of $1,453 million and
$1,149 million, respectively, were primarily comprised of loans to dealers, and the SPC’s liabilities of $1,452 million and
$1,148 million, respectively, were primarily comprised of commercial paper.  The assets of the SPC are not available to pay
Cat Financial’s creditors. Cat Financial may be obligated to perform under the guarantee if the SPC experiences losses. No loss
has been experienced or is anticipated under this loan purchase agreement.
 
Cat Financial has commitments to extend credit to customers and Caterpillar dealers through lines of credit and other pre-
approved credit arrangements. Cat Financial applies the same credit policies and approval process for these commitments to
extend credit as we do for other financing. Collateral is not required for these commitments, but if credit is extended, collateral
may be required upon funding.  The amount of unused commitments to extend credit to Caterpillar dealers was $11,154 million
at December 31, 2019. The amount of unused commitments to extend credit to customers was $693 million at December 31,
2019. A significant portion of these commitments is not expected to be fully drawn upon; therefore, the total commitment
amounts do not represent a future cash requirement. Cat Financial generally has the right to unconditionally cancel, alter, or
amend the terms of these commitments at any time.
 
Our product warranty liability is determined by applying historical claim rate experience to the current field population and
dealer inventory.  Generally, historical claim rates are based on actual warranty experience for each product by machine
model/engine size by customer or dealer location (inside or outside North America).  Specific rates are developed for each
product shipment month and are updated monthly based on actual warranty claim experience.

22.Environmental and legal matters
The Company is regulated by federal, state and international environmental laws governing our use, transport and disposal of
substances and control of emissions. In addition to governing our manufacturing and other operations, these laws often impact
the development of our products, including, but not limited to, required compliance with air emissions standards applicable to
internal combustion engines. We have made, and will continue to make, significant research and development and capital
expenditures to comply with these emissions standards.
131
Table of Contents
We are engaged in remedial activities at a number of locations, often with other companies, pursuant to federal and state laws.
When it is probable we will pay remedial costs at a site, and those costs can be reasonably estimated, the investigation,
remediation, and operating and maintenance costs are accrued against our earnings. Costs are accrued based on consideration
of currently available data and information with respect to each individual site, including available technologies, current
applicable laws and regulations, and prior remediation experience. Where no amount within a range of estimates is more likely,
we accrue the minimum. Where multiple potentially responsible parties are involved, we consider our proportionate share of
the probable costs. In formulating the estimate of probable costs, we do not consider amounts expected to be recovered from
insurance companies or others. We reassess these accrued amounts on a quarterly basis. The amount recorded for
environmental remediation is not material and is included in Accrued expenses. We believe there is no more than a remote
chance that a material amount for remedial activities at any individual site, or at all the sites in the aggregate, will be required.
On January 27, 2020, the Brazilian Federal Environmental Agency (“IBAMA”) issued Caterpillar Brasil Ltda a notice of
violation regarding allegations around the requirements for use of imported oils at the Piracicaba, Brazil facility.  We have
instituted processes to address the allegations.  While we are still discussing resolution of these allegations with IBAMA, the
initial notice from IBAMA included a proposed fine of approximately $370,000.  We do not expect this fine or our response to
address the allegations to have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated results of operations, financial position
or liquidity.
On January 7, 2015, the Company received a grand jury subpoena from the U.S. District Court for the Central District of
Illinois. The subpoena requests documents and information from the Company relating to, among other things, financial
information concerning U.S. and non-U.S. Caterpillar subsidiaries (including undistributed profits of non-U.S. subsidiaries and
the movement of cash among U.S. and non-U.S. subsidiaries). The Company has received additional subpoenas relating to this
investigation requesting additional documents and information relating to, among other things, the purchase and resale of
replacement parts by Caterpillar Inc. and non-U.S. Caterpillar subsidiaries, dividend distributions of certain non-U.S.
Caterpillar subsidiaries, and Caterpillar SARL (CSARL) and related structures. On March 2-3, 2017, agents with the
Department of Commerce, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Internal Revenue Service executed search and
seizure warrants at three facilities of the Company in the Peoria, Illinois area, including its former corporate headquarters. The
warrants identify, and agents seized, documents and information related to, among other things, the export of products from the
United States, the movement of products between the United States and Switzerland, the relationship between Caterpillar Inc.
and CSARL, and sales outside the United States. It is the Company’s understanding that the warrants, which concern both tax
and export activities, are related to the ongoing grand jury investigation. The Company is continuing to cooperate with this
investigation. The Company is unable to predict the outcome or reasonably estimate any potential loss; however, we currently
believe that this matter will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated results of operations, financial
position or liquidity.
On March 20, 2014, Brazil’s Administrative Council for Economic Defense (CADE) published a Technical Opinion which
named 18 companies and over 100 individuals as defendants, including two subsidiaries of Caterpillar Inc., MGE -
Equipamentos e Serviços Ferroviários Ltda. (MGE) and Caterpillar Brasil Ltda (CBL). The publication of the Technical
Opinion opened CADE’s official administrative investigation into allegations that the defendants participated in
anticompetitive bid activity for the construction and maintenance of metro and train networks in Brazil. While companies
cannot be held criminally liable for anticompetitive conduct in Brazil, criminal charges have been brought against one current
employee of MGE and two former employees of MGE involving the same conduct alleged by CADE. On July 8, 2019, CADE
found MGE, one of its current employees and two of its former employees liable for anticompetitive conduct. CBL was
dismissed from the proceeding without any finding of liability. MGE intends to appeal CADE’s findings. We currently believe
that this matter will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated results of operations, financial position
or liquidity.
In addition, we are involved in other unresolved legal actions that arise in the normal course of business. The most prevalent of
these unresolved actions involve disputes related to product design, manufacture and performance liability (including claimed
asbestos and welding fumes exposure), contracts, employment issues, environmental matters, intellectual property rights, taxes
(other than income taxes) and securities laws. The aggregate range of reasonably possible losses in excess of accrued liabilities,
if any, associated with these unresolved legal actions is not material. In some cases, we cannot reasonably estimate a range of
loss because there is insufficient information regarding the matter. However, we believe there is no more than a remote chance
that any liability arising from these matters would be material. Although it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome
of these unresolved legal actions, we believe that these actions will not individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse
effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity.

23.Segment information
 
A.Basis for segment information
 
Our Executive Office is comprised of a Chief Executive Officer (CEO), four Group Presidents, a Chief Financial Officer
(CFO), a Chief Legal Officer, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary and a Chief Human Resources Officer. The Group
Presidents and CFO are accountable for a related set of end-to-end businesses that they manage.  The Chief Legal Officer,
General Counsel and Corporate Secretary leads the Law, Security and Public Policy Division. The Chief Human Resources
Officer leads the Human Resources Organization. The CEO allocates resources and manages performance at the Group
President/CFO level.  As such, the CEO serves as our Chief Operating Decision Maker, and operating segments are primarily
based on the Group President/CFO reporting structure.
  
Three of our operating segments, Construction Industries, Resource Industries and Energy & Transportation are led by Group
Presidents.  One operating segment, Financial Products, is led by the CFO who also has responsibility for Corporate Services. 
Corporate Services is a cost center primarily responsible for the performance of certain support functions globally and to
provide centralized services; it does not meet the definition of an operating segment. One Group President leads one smaller
operating segment that is included in the All Other operating segment. The Law, Security and Public Policy Division and the
Human Resources Organization are cost centers and do not meet the definition of an operating segment.
 B.             Description of segments
 
We have five operating segments, of which four are reportable segments.  Following is a brief description of our reportable
segments and the business activities included in the All Other operating segment:
 
Construction Industries:  A segment primarily responsible for supporting customers using machinery in infrastructure,
forestry and building construction applications. Responsibilities include business strategy, product design, product
management and development, manufacturing, marketing and sales and product support. The product portfolio includes asphalt
pavers; backhoe loaders; compactors; cold planers; compact track and multi-terrain loaders; mini, small, medium and large
track excavators; forestry excavators; feller bunchers; harvesters; knuckleboom loaders; motor graders; pipelayers; road
reclaimers; site prep tractors; skidders; skid steer loaders; telehandlers; small and medium track-type tractors; track-type
loaders; utility vehicles; wheel excavators; compact, small and medium wheel loaders; and related parts and work tools. Inter-
segment sales are a source of revenue for this segment.
Resource Industries:  A segment primarily responsible for supporting customers using machinery in mining, heavy
construction, quarry and aggregates, waste and material handling applications. Responsibilities include business strategy,
product design, product management and development, manufacturing, marketing and sales and product support. The product
portfolio includes large track-type tractors; large mining trucks; autonomous ready vehicles and solutions; hard rock vehicles;
longwall miners; electric rope shovels; draglines; hydraulic shovels; rotary drills; large wheel loaders; off-highway trucks;
articulated trucks; wheel tractor scrapers; wheel dozers; landfill compactors; soil compactors; hard rock continuous mining
systems; select work tools; machinery components and related parts. In addition to equipment, Resource Industries also
develops and sells technology products and services to provide customers fleet management, equipment management analytics
and autonomous machine capabilities. Resource Industries also manages areas that provide services to other parts of the
company, including integrated manufacturing and research and development. Inter-segment sales are a source of revenue for
this segment.
Energy & Transportation:  A segment primarily responsible for supporting customers using reciprocating engines, turbines,
diesel-electric locomotives and related parts across industries serving Oil and Gas, Power Generation, Industrial and
Transportation applications, including marine and rail-related businesses. Responsibilities include business strategy, product
design, product management and development, manufacturing, marketing and sales and product support of turbine machinery
and integrated systems and solutions and turbine-related services; reciprocating engine-powered generator sets; integrated
systems used in the electric power generation industry; reciprocating engines and integrated systems and solutions for the
marine and oil and gas industries; reciprocating engines supplied to the industrial industry as well as Cat machinery; the
remanufacturing of Caterpillar engines and components and remanufacturing services for other companies; the business
strategy, product design, product management and development, manufacturing, remanufacturing, leasing and service of
diesel-electric locomotives and components and other rail-related products and services; and product support of on-highway
vocational trucks for North America. Inter-segment sales are a source of revenue for this segment.
 
133
Table of Contents
Financial Products Segment:  Provides financing alternatives to customers and dealers around the world for Caterpillar
products, as well as financing for vehicles, power generation facilities and marine vessels that, in most cases, incorporate
Caterpillar products. Financing plans include operating and finance leases, installment sale contracts, working capital loans and
wholesale financing plans. The segment also provides insurance and risk management products and services that help
customers and dealers manage their business risk. Insurance and risk management products offered include physical damage
insurance, inventory protection plans, extended service coverage for machines and engines, and dealer property and casualty
insurance. The various forms of financing, insurance and risk management products offered to customers and dealers help
support the purchase and lease of our equipment. The segment also earns revenues from ME&T, but the related costs are not
allocated to operating segments.
 
All Other operating segment:  Primarily includes activities such as: business strategy, product management and development,
manufacturing and sourcing of filters and fluids, undercarriage, ground-engaging tools, fluid transfer products, precision seals,
rubber sealing and connecting components primarily for Cat products; parts distribution; integrated logistics solutions,
distribution services responsible for dealer development and administration including a wholly owned dealer in Japan, dealer
portfolio management and ensuring the most efficient and effective distribution of machines, engines and parts; and digital
investments for new customer and dealer solutions that integrate data analytics with state-of-the-art digital technologies while
transforming the buying experience. Results for the All Other operating segment are included as a reconciling item between
reportable segments and consolidated external reporting.
 
C.             Segment measurement and reconciliations
 
There are several methodology differences between our segment reporting and our external reporting.  The following is a list of
the more significant methodology differences:
 
• ME&T segment net assets generally include inventories, receivables, property, plant and equipment, goodwill,
intangibles, accounts payable and customer advances.  Beginning in 2019, operating lease right-of-use assets are
included in segment assets. In 2018, the present value of future lease payments for certain ME&T operating leases
was included in segment assets while the estimated financing component of the lease payments was excluded.
Liabilities other than accounts payable and customer advances are generally managed at the corporate level and are
not included in segment operations.  Financial Products Segment assets generally include all categories of assets.
 
• Segment inventories and cost of sales are valued using a current cost methodology.
• Goodwill allocated to segments is amortized using a fixed amount based on a 20 year useful life.  This methodology
difference only impacts segment assets; no goodwill amortization expense is included in segment profit. In addition,
only a portion of goodwill for certain acquisitions made in 2011 or later has been allocated to segments.
• Currency exposures for ME&T are generally managed at the corporate level and the effects of changes in exchange
rates on results of operations within the year are not included in segment profit.  The net difference created in the
translation of revenues and costs between exchange rates used for U.S. GAAP reporting and exchange rates used for
segment reporting is reported as a methodology difference.
• Stock-based compensation expense is not included in segment profit.
• Postretirement benefit expenses are split; segments are generally responsible for service costs, with the remaining
elements of net periodic benefit cost included as a methodology difference.
• ME&T segment profit is determined on a pretax basis and excludes interest expense and most other income/expense
items.  Financial Products Segment profit is determined on a pretax basis and includes other income/expense items.
Reconciling items are created based on accounting differences between segment reporting and our consolidated external
reporting. Please refer to pages 137 to 143 for financial information regarding significant reconciling items.  Most of our
reconciling items are self-explanatory given the above explanations.  For the reconciliation of profit, we have grouped the
reconciling items as follows:
 
• Corporate costs:  These costs are related to corporate requirements primarily for compliance and legal functions for
the benefit of the entire organization.
134
Table of Contents
• Restructuring costs:  May include costs for employee separation, long-lived asset impairments and contract
terminations. These costs are included in Other operating (income) expenses except for defined-benefit plan
curtailment losses and special termination benefits, which are included in Other income (expense). Restructuring costs
also include other exit-related costs which may consist of accelerated depreciation, inventory write-downs, building
demolition, equipment relocation and project management costs and LIFO inventory decrement benefits from
inventory liquidations at closed facilities, all of which are primarily included in Cost of goods sold. Beginning in
2019, only certain restructuring costs are excluded from segment profit. A table, Reconciliation of Restructuring costs
on page 140, has been included to illustrate how segment profit would have been impacted by the restructuring costs.
See Note 25 for more information.
• Methodology differences:  See previous discussion of significant accounting differences between segment reporting
and consolidated external reporting.
• Timing:   Timing differences in the recognition of costs between segment reporting and consolidated external
reporting. For example, certain costs are reported on the cash basis for segment reporting and the accrual basis for
consolidated external reporting.

24.Acquisitions
ECM S.p.A.
On January 2, 2018, we acquired 100 percent of the equity in privately held ECM S.p.A. (ECM). Headquartered in Pistoia,
Italy, ECM designs, manufactures, sells and services advanced signal systems for the rail industry. The ECM acquisition was
executed to expand our presence in the international freight and transit industries through a combination of broad product
offerings and strong reputation in the signaling market. The purchase price for the acquisition was $225 million, consisting of
$249 million paid at closing, net of $25 million of cash acquired and $1 million of debt assumed.
The transaction was financed with available cash. Tangible assets as of the acquisition date were $109 million, recorded at their
fair values, and primarily included cash of $25 million, receivables of $28 million, inventories of $29 million, and property,
plant and equipment of $17 million. Finite-lived intangible assets acquired of $112 million included customer relationships,
developed technology and trade names. The finite lived intangible assets are being amortized on a straight-line basis over a
weighted-average amortization period of approximately 13 years. Liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date were $79
million, recorded at their fair values, and primarily included accounts payable of $38 million and net deferred tax liabilities of
$29 million. Goodwill of $109 million, non-deductible for income tax purposes, represented the excess of the consideration
transferred over the net assets recognized and represented the estimated future economic benefits arising from other assets
acquired that could not be individually identified and separately recognized. Factors that contributed to a purchase price
resulting in the recognition of goodwill include ECM’s strategic fit into our rail product portfolio, the opportunity to provide a
complete line-up of signaling and train control systems and the acquired assembled workforce. The results of the acquired
business for the period from the acquisition date are included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and
reported in the Energy & Transportation segment in Note 23. Assuming this transaction had been made at the beginning of any
period presented, the consolidated pro forma results would not be materially different from reported results.
Downer Freight Rail
On January 2, 2018, we completed the acquisition of certain assets and liabilities of the Downer Freight Rail business (Downer
Freight Rail). Headquartered in North Ryde, Australia, Downer Freight Rail provides a full suite of rolling stock, aftermarket
parts and services throughout Australia. The acquisition was executed to strengthen our existing Rail footprint in Australia,
which currently includes rolling stock maintenance facilities, as well as infrastructure and signaling facilities. The purchase
price for the acquisition was $97 million.
The transaction was financed with available cash. Tangible assets as of the acquisition date were $86 million, recorded at their
fair values, and primarily included receivables of $23 million, inventories of $40 million, and property, plant and equipment of
$15 million. Finite-lived customer relationship intangible assets acquired were $6 million. The finite lived intangible assets are
being amortized on a straight-line basis over an amortization period of 15 years. Liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date
were $14 million, which represented their fair values. Goodwill of $18 million, not expected to be deducted for income tax
purposes, represented the excess of the consideration transferred over the net assets recognized and represented the estimated
future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired that could not be individually identified and separately recognized.
Factors that contributed to a purchase price resulting in the recognition of goodwill include Downer Freight Rail’s strategic fit
into our rail product portfolio, the opportunity to expand our aftermarket parts and maintenance service portfolio in Australia
and the acquired assembled workforce. The results of the acquired business for the period from the acquisition date are
included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and reported in the Energy & Transportation segment in Note
23. Assuming this transaction had been made at the beginning of any period presented, the consolidated pro forma results
would not be materially different from reported results.
25. Restructuring costs
 
Our accounting for employee separations is dependent upon how the particular program is designed. For voluntary programs,
eligible separation costs are recognized at the time of employee acceptance unless the acceptance requires explicit approval by
the company. For involuntary programs, eligible costs are recognized when management has approved the program, the
affected employees have been properly notified and the costs are estimable.
Restructuring costs for 2019, 2018 and 2017 were as follows:

3 Represents costs related to our restructuring programs, primarily for project management, inventory write-downs, accelerated depreciation and
equipment relocation, and also LIFO inventory decrement benefits from inventory liquidations at closed facilities, all of which are primarily included
in Cost of goods sold.
  
The restructuring costs in 2019 were primarily related to restructuring actions across the company. The restructuring costs in
2018 were primarily related to ongoing facility closures across the company. In 2017, about half of the restructuring costs were
related to the closure of the facility in Gosselies, Belgium, within Construction Industries, and the remainder was related to
other restructuring actions across the company.
Certain restructuring costs are a reconciling item between Segment profit and Consolidated profit before taxes. See Note 23 for
more information.
The following table summarizes the 2018 and 2019 employee separation activity:
(Millions of dollars)
Liability balance at December 31, 2017 $ 249
Increase in liability (separation char ges) 112
Reduction in liability (payments) (276)
Liability balance at December 31, 2018 $ 85
Increase in liability (separation char ges) 48
Reduction in liability (payments) (85)
Liability balance at December 31, 2019 $ 48
 
 
Most of the remaining liability balance as of December 31, 2019 is expected to be paid in 2020.
In March 2017, Caterpillar informed Belgian authorities of the decision to proceed to a collective dismissal, which led to the
closure of the Gosselies site, impacting about 2,000 employees. Production of Caterpillar products at the Gosselies site ended
during the second quarter of 2017. The other operations and functions at the Gosselies site were phased out by the end of the
second quarter of 2018. The program concluded in 2018, and we incurred a total of $647 million of restructuring costs
(primarily in 2017) under the program. Those costs were primarily related to employee separation costs, long-lived asset
impairments, and other costs which were partially offset by a LIFO inventory decrement benefit.
In September 2015, we announced a large scale restructuring plan (the Plan) including a voluntary retirement enhancement
program for qualifying U.S. employees, several voluntary separation programs outside of the United States, additional
involuntary programs throughout the company and manufacturing facility consolidations and closures. The largest action
among those included in the Plan was related to our European manufacturing footprint which led to the Gosselies, Belgium,
facility, closure as discussed above. We incurred $43 million, $121 million and $817 million of restructuring costs associated
with these actions in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The Plan concluded in 2019, and total restructuring costs incurred
since inception of the Plan were $1,831 million.
