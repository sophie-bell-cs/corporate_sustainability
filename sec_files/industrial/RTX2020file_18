(1) Consists of the following issuable shares of Common Stock awarded under the United Technologies
Corporation 2018 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the “2018 LTIP”) and the United Technologies Corporation Long-
Term Incentive Plan, as amended (together with the 2018 LTIP, the “LTIPs”): (i) shares of Common Stock
issuable upon the exercise of outstanding non-qualiﬁed stock options; (ii) shares of Common Stock issuable
upon the exercise of outstanding Stock Appreciation Rights (SARs); (iii) shares of Common Stock issuable
pursuant to outstanding restricted stock unit and performance share unit awards, assuming performance at
the target level (up to an additional 1,143,000 shares of Common Stock could be issued if performance
goals are achieved above target), except for the 2016 performance share unit awards which reﬂect actual
performance achieved; and (iv) shares of Common Stock issuable upon the settlement of outstanding
deferred stock units and restricted stock units awarded under the United Technologies Corporation Board of
Directors Deferred Stock Unit Plan, as amended and restated eﬀective April 24, 2017. Under the LTIPs, each
SAR referred to in clause (ii) is exercisable for a number of shares of Common Stock having a value equal
to the increase in the market price of a share of such stock from the date the SAR was granted. For
purposes of determining the total number of shares to be issued in respect of outstanding SARs as reﬂected
in column (a) above, we have used the NYSE closing price for a share of Common Stock on December 31,
2018 of $106.48. The weighted-average exercise price of outstanding options, warrants and rights shown in
column (b) takes into account only the shares identiﬁed in clauses (i) and (ii).
(2) Consists of shares of Common Stock issuable pursuant to outstanding restricted stock unit awards
granted under the Rockwell Collins, Inc. 2015 Long-Term Incentive Plan that we assumed upon the
acquisition of Rockwell Collins.
(3) Represents the maximum number of shares of Common Stock available to be awarded under the 2018
LTIP as of December 31, 2018. Performance share units and restricted stock units (Full Share Awards) will
result in a reduction in the number of shares of Common Stock available for delivery under the 2018 LTIP in
an amount equal to 4.03 times the number of shares to which the award corresponds. Stock options and
stock appreciation rights do not constitute Full Share Awards and will result in a reduction in the number of
shares of Common Stock available for delivery under the 2018 LTIP on a one-for-one basis.
