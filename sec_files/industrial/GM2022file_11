GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES
PART I
Item 1. Business
General Motors Company (sometimes referred to as we, our, us, ourselves, the Company, General Motors, or GM) was
incorporated as a Delaware corporation in 2009. We design, build and sell trucks, crossovers, cars and automobile parts and provide
software-enabled services and subscriptions worldwide. Our automotive operations meet the demands of our customers through our
automotive segments: GM North America (GMNA) and GM International (GMI) with vehicles developed, manufactured and/or
marketed under the Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet and GMC brands. We also have equity ownership stakes in entities that meet the
demands of customers in other countries, primarily in China, with vehicles developed, manufactured and/or marketed under the
Baojun, Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet and Wuling brands. Cruise is our global segment responsible for the development and
commercialization of autonomous vehicle technology. We provide automotive financing services through our General Motors
Financial Company, Inc. (GM Financial) segment. Refer to Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) and Note 23 to our consolidated financial statements for financial information about
our segments. Except for per share amounts or as otherwise specified, amounts presented within tables are stated in millions.
Forward-looking statements in this Business section are not guarantees of future performance and may involve risks and
uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors and the
"Forward-Looking Statements" section of Part II, Item 7. MD&A for a discussion of these risks and uncertainties.
Our vision for the future is a world with zero crashes, zero emissions and zero congestion, which guides our growth-focused
strategy to invest in electric vehicles (EVs) and autonomous vehicles (AVs), software-enabled services and subscriptions and new
business opportunities, while strengthening our market position in profitable internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles, such as
trucks and sport utility vehicles (SUVs). We have committed to an all-electric future with a core focus on zero emission battery EVs
as part of our long-term strategy to reduce petroleum consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. As a result, we have
committed to making total EV and AV investments of more than $35.0 billion from 2020 through 2025.
We have an opportunity to grow our vehicle and financing revenue by continuing to capitalize on the strength of our franchises
and scaling our EV production and customer base over the next decade. We also have the potential of growing our revenue through
our software-enabled services and subscriptions, including OnStar, our advanced driver-assistance system (ADAS), Super Cruise,
and future offerings, such as our next-generation ADAS, Ultra Cruise, and Ultifi. Additionally, we are incubating several new
businesses with a start-up mindset that we believe will enable us to attract new customers and generate revenues in new areas.
Electric Vehicles We plan to launch more than 30 EVs globally by 2025. A key element in our EV strategy is Ultium, our all-new
dedicated battery electric platform. Our first Ultium-based products launched with the GMC HUMMER EV and BrightDrop EV600
in 2021, to be followed by the Cadillac LYRIQ in 2022. This all-new platform is flexible and will be leveraged across multiple
brands and vehicle sizes, styles and drive configurations, allowing for quick response to customer preferences and a shorter design
and development lead time compared to our ICE vehicles.
In September 2021, we announced three new drive assist motors as part of Ultium Drive, calibrated in-house to ensure the highest
level of performance in Ultium-based EVs. We designed the motors as a scalable family, sharing design principles as well as similar
tooling and manufacturing strategies.
In November 2021, we began production at GM’s Factory ZERO Detroit-Hamtramck Assembly Center (Factory ZERO), which
was re-tooled into a fully dedicated EV facility to produce the GMC HUMMER EV and the upcoming Cruise Origin and Chevrolet
Silverado EV, which we revealed in January 2022 at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Nevada. In January 2022, we
announced that we will convert our assembly plant in Orion Township, Michigan for production of the Chevrolet Silverado EV and
the electric GMC Sierra. Additionally, we have announced plans to mass-produce battery cells for these and other future EVs
through Ultium Cells LLC (an equally owned joint venture with LG Energy Solution) in Lordstown, Ohio, Spring Hill, Tennessee
and Lansing, Michigan. A fourth U.S.-based battery cell plant is also planned by mid-decade.
To support mass market adoption of EVs, we are working to ensure that our customers will have access to comprehensive
charging solutions. For personal vehicles, this means strategically addressing charging needs at home, the workplace and in public
locations. For fleet vehicles, this means turnkey charging solutions and fleet and facility energy management services. We have
announced collaborative work with several charge network operators to filter real-time data on their respective
1

GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES
networks and charge station health into Ultium Charge 360, a holistic charging approach that integrates charging networks, GM
vehicle mobile apps and other products and services to simplify the overall charging experience for GM EV owners.
Ultium Charge 360 is also available to our fleet and BrightDrop customers and offers fleet and facility management tools,
integration with GM’s fleet management offerings and support across a wide range of fleet sizes. In October 2021, we announced a
new Dealer Community Charging Program to install up to 40,000 Level 2 EV chargers across the U.S. and Canada. Working with
our dealers, we intend to expand access to charging in local communities, including in underserved, rural and urban areas where EV
charging access is often limited. This initiative, which is expected to begin in 2022, is part of our commitment to invest nearly $750
million to expand home, workplace and public charging infrastructure through the Ultium Charge 360 ecosystem through 2025.
OnStar and Vehicle Connectivity We offer OnStar and connected services to more than 22 million connected vehicles globally
through subscription-based and complimentary services. We are among the leaders in the industry, with significant global real-world
experience in delivering connected services and advanced safety features. OnStar provides safety and security services for retail and
fleet customers, including automatic crash response, emergency services, roadside assistance, crisis assist, stolen vehicle assistance
and turn-by-turn navigation. Additionally, we offer OnStar Guardian, a mobile app that allows customers to access key OnStar safety
and security services from anywhere and in any vehicle. Fleet customers leverage OnStar Vehicle Insights, our telematics solution
across their entire fleet, regardless of vehicle make or model. We also offer a variety of connected services, including mobile apps
for owners to remotely control certain vehicle features and EV owners to locate charging stations, on-demand vehicle diagnostics,
GM Smart Driver, GM Marketplace in-vehicle commerce, Amazon Alexa in-vehicle voice, Google's Voice Assistant, navigation and
app ecosystem, connected navigation and SiriusXM with 360L and 4G LTE wireless connectivity. In August 2021, we announced
plans to roll out 5G connectivity in select model year 2024 vehicles.
Super Cruise and Ultra Cruise We offer Super Cruise, the industry's first hands-free driver assistance feature for enabled roads in
the U.S. and Canada, which is powered by vehicle connectivity by means of a Super Cruise subscription. Super Cruise capabilities
will be available on eight model year 2022 vehicles in the beginning of 2022 and will expand to be included on more than 20 models
by 2023. In October 2021, we announced Ultra Cruise, a significant next step in hands-free advanced driving-assistance technology
that we anticipate will be available on select models in 2023. It will create a virtually door-to-door hands-free driving experience as
it will be designed to handle 95 percent of all driving scenarios on every paved road in the U.S. and Canada over time.
Ultifi Our end-to-end software platform Ultifi will provide our customers with software-defined features, apps and services over-
the-air starting in 2023. Ultifi and the apps it enables will empower customers to update their ownership experiences continuously
with desirable features such as vehicle performance, ADAS, safety and security features, climate and comfort options, personal
themes and EV ownership experience elements, including battery and charging details.
Cruise Cruise is driving leadership in the development and commercialization of AV technology. We believe that building all-
electric vehicles with autonomous capabilities integrated from the beginning, rather than through retrofits, is the most efficient way
to unlock the tremendous potential societal benefits of self-driving cars. The Cruise Origin, a purpose-built, all-electric, self-driving
vehicle that is being co-developed by GM, Cruise and Honda Motor Company, Ltd. (Honda), will be built on General Motors’ all-
new modular architecture, powered by the Ultium platform, at Factory ZERO starting in early 2023, pending government approvals.
In October 2020, Cruise received a driverless test permit from the California Department of Motor Vehicles to remove test drivers
from Cruise autonomous test vehicles in San Francisco and subsequently began fully driverless testing. In October 2020, GM and
Cruise also announced they will file an exemption petition with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA)
seeking regulatory approval for the Origin’s deployment, and withdrew an earlier exemption petition that was limited to the Cruise
AV derived from the Chevrolet Bolt platform.
In June 2021, Cruise received a driverless test permit from the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) to provide unpaid
rides to the public in driverless vehicles. In September 2021, Cruise received approval of its Autonomous Vehicle Deployment
Permit from the California Department of Motor Vehicles to commercially deploy driverless AVs. Cruise will need one additional
permit from the CPUC to charge the public for driverless rides in California. Given the potential of all-electric self-driving vehicles
to help save lives, reshape our cities and reduce emissions, the goal of Cruise is to deliver its self-driving services as soon as
possible, but as Cruise continues to expand and scale its operations safety will continue to be the gating metric — supported by
Cruise's Safety Management System and its other risk identification, assessment and mitigation processes.
BrightDrop BrightDrop is building an ecosystem of all-electric and connected first-to-last mile products and services, including
light commercial vehicles, smart containers and a software platform for fleet and asset management designed to help delivery and
logistics companies deliver goods more efficiently. We are converting our CAMI manufacturing plant in Ingersoll,

Ontario to produce the all new BrightDrop EV600 and BrightDrop EV410 electric light commercial vehicles. In December 2021, we
started deliveries of the BrightDrop EV600 to FedEx Express, our launch customer. Additionally, we announced that Verizon will be
the first customer for the BrightDrop EV410.
HYDROTEC We are developing hydrogen fuel cell applications across transportations and industries, including mobile power
generation, class 7/8 truck, locomotive, aerospace and marine applications. The development of HYDROTEC is another element of
our long-term strategy and commitment toward the reduction of petroleum consumption and GHG emissions. We believe hydrogen
fuel cells will play an important role in many automotive and other mobility applications where customers will derive additional
benefits from the ability to refuel quickly, an extended range, suitability for heavier payloads and central refueling of large fleets.
GM and Honda, through our long-term strategic alliance to collaborate in research and advanced engineering efforts, are developing
and commercializing fuel cell systems. In 2021, GM announced it will supply HYDROTEC to Navistar, Inc., which is developing
hydrogen-powered heavy trucks to launch in 2024, and to Liebherr-Aerospace, which is developing hydrogen-powered auxiliary
power units for aircraft. In June 2021, we announced a collaboration with Wabtec Corporation to develop and commercialize the
Ultium platform and HYDROTEC fuel systems for their locomotives.
OnStar Insurance Services OnStar Insurance is currently available in 46 states and Washington, D.C. and is expected to be
available in all 50 states by the second quarter of 2022. In the future, we plan to integrate insurance products into the vehicle
experience and offer premiums based on personal driving behaviors by leveraging, with customer consent, data coming from GM
vehicles.
GM Defense Providing commercially developed solutions, including purpose-built vehicles, for government and military
customers. GM Defense's growth strategy is focused on building a portfolio of products, including the Infantry Squad Vehicle and
the purpose-built Heavy Duty Suburban, by leveraging our manufacturing and innovation capabilities.
Competitive Position and Vehicle Sales The principal factors that determine consumer vehicle preferences in the markets in which
we operate include overall vehicle design, price, quality, available options, safety, reliability, fuel economy and functionality. Market
leadership in individual countries in which we compete varies widely.
We present both wholesale and total vehicle sales data to assist in the analysis of our revenue and our market share. Wholesale
vehicle sales data consists of sales to GM's dealers and distributors as well as sales to the U.S. Government and excludes vehicles
sold by our joint ventures. Wholesale vehicle sales data correlates to our revenue recognized from the sale of vehicles, which is the
largest component of Automotive net sales and revenue. In the year ended December 31, 2021, 30% of our wholesale vehicle sales
volume was generated outside the U.S. The following table summarizes wholesale vehicle sales by automotive segment (vehicles in
thousands):
Years Ended December 31,
2021 2020 2019
GMNA 2,308 80.7 % 2,707 80.3 % 3,214 76.4 %
GMI 551 19.3 % 663 19.7 % 995 23.6 %
Total 2,859 100.0 % 3,370 100.0 % 4,209 100.0 %
Total vehicle sales data represents: (1) retail sales (i.e., sales to consumers who purchase new vehicles from dealers or
distributors); (2) fleet sales, such as sales to large and small businesses, governments, and daily rental car companies; and (3)
vehicles used by dealers in their businesses, including courtesy transportation vehicles. Total vehicle sales data includes all sales by
joint ventures on a total vehicle basis, not based on our percentage ownership interest in the joint venture. Certain joint venture
agreements in China allow for the contractual right to report vehicle sales of non-GM trademarked vehicles by those joint ventures,
which are included in the total vehicle sales we report for China. While total vehicle sales data does not correlate directly to the
revenue we recognize during a particular period, we believe it is indicative of the underlying demand for our vehicles. Total vehicle
sales data represents management's good faith estimate based on sales reported by GM's dealers, distributors, and joint ventures,
commercially available data sources such as registration and insurance data, and internal estimates and forecasts when other data is
not available.

As discussed above, total vehicle sales and market share data provided in the table above includes fleet vehicles. We sell vehicles
directly or through our dealer network to fleet customers, including daily rental car companies, commercial fleet customers, leasing
companies and governments. Certain fleet transactions, particularly sales to daily rental car companies, are generally less profitable
than retail sales to end customers. The following table summarizes estimated fleet sales and those sales as a percentage of total
vehicle sales (vehicles in thousands):
Years Ended December 31,
2021 2020 2019
GMNA 399 493 741 
GMI 311 351 498 
Total fleet sales 710 844 1,239 
Fleet sales as a percentage of total vehicle sales 11.3 % 12.4 % 16.1 %
Product Pricing Several methods are used to promote our products, including the use of dealer, retail and fleet incentives, such as
customer rebates and finance rate support. The level of incentives is dependent upon the level of competition in the markets in which
we operate and the level of demand for our products.
Cyclical and Seasonal Nature of Business The market for vehicles is cyclical and depends in part on general economic
conditions, credit availability and consumer spending. Vehicle markets are also seasonal. Production varies from month to month.
Vehicle model changeovers occur throughout the year as a result of new market entries.
Relationship with Dealers We market vehicles and automotive parts worldwide primarily through a network of independent
authorized retail dealers. These outlets include distributors, dealers and authorized sales, service and parts outlets. Our customers can
obtain a wide range of after-sale vehicle services and products through our dealer network, such as maintenance, light repairs,
collision repairs, vehicle accessories and extended service warranties. The number of authorized dealerships and other agents
performing similar functions were 4,670 in GMNA and 7,670 in GMI at December 31, 2021.
We and our joint ventures enter into a contract with each authorized dealer agreeing to sell to the dealer one or more specified
product lines at wholesale prices and granting the dealer the right to sell those products to customers from an approved location. Our
dealers often offer more than one GM brand at a single dealership in a number of our markets. Authorized dealers offer parts,
accessories, service and repairs for GM vehicles in the product lines that they sell using GM parts and accessories. Our dealers are
authorized to service GM vehicles under our limited warranty, and those repairs are made almost exclusively with GM parts. Our
dealers generally provide their customers with access to credit or lease financing, vehicle insurance and extended service contracts,
which may be provided by GM Financial and other financial institutions.
The quality of GM dealerships and our relationship with our dealers are critical to our success given that they maintain the
primary sales and service interface with the end consumer of our products. In addition to the terms of our contracts with our dealers,
we are regulated by various country and state franchise laws and regulations that may supersede those contractual terms and impose
specific regulatory requirements and standards for initiating dealer network changes, pursuing terminations for cause and other
contractual matters.
Research, Product Development and Intellectual Property Costs for research, manufacturing engineering, product engineering
and design and development activities primarily relate to developing new products or services or improving existing products or
services, including activities related to vehicle and GHG emissions control, improved fuel economy, EVs, AVs and the safety of
drivers and passengers. Research and development expenses were $7.9 billion, $6.2 billion and $6.8 billion in the years ended
December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.
Product Development The Global Product Development organization is responsible for designing, developing and integrating all
global products and their components while aiming to maximize part sharing across multiple vehicle segments. Global teams in
Design, Program Management & Execution, Component & Subsystem Engineering, Product Integrity, Safety, Controls and Software
Engineering and Purchasing & Supply Chain collaborate to meet customer requirements and maximize global economies of scale.
Our global vehicle architecture development is headquartered at our Global Technical Center in Warren, Michigan. Cross-segment
part sharing is an essential enabler to optimize our vehicle portfolio, with more than 75% of our global internal combustion vehicle
sales volume expected to come from five internal combustion vehicle architectures through this decade. We
5

GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES
will continue to leverage our architecture portfolio to accommodate our customers around the world while achieving our financial
goals.
We invested in construction of the Wallace Battery Cell Innovation Center, an all-new facility that will significantly expand the
Company's battery technology operations and accelerate development and commercialization of longer range, more affordable EV
batteries. The Wallace Center will be located on the campus of the Global Technical Center in Warren, Michigan.
Intellectual Property We are constantly innovating and hold a significant number of patents, copyrights, trade secrets and other
intellectual property that protect those innovations in numerous countries. While no single piece of intellectual property is
individually material to our business as a whole, our intellectual property is important to our operations and continued technological
development. Additionally, we hold a number of trademarks and service marks that are very important to our identity and
recognition in the marketplace.
Raw Materials, Services and Supplies We purchase a wide variety of raw materials, parts, supplies, energy, freight, transportation
and other services from numerous suppliers to manufacture our products. The raw materials primarily include steel, aluminum,
resins, copper, lead and precious metals. We do not normally carry substantial inventories of these raw materials in excess of levels
reasonably required to meet our production requirements, and we have not experienced any significant shortages of raw materials.
Costs are expected to remain elevated due to the price of commodities and the continuing existence of tariffs. We also purchase
systems, components and parts from suppliers. The global semiconductor supply shortage has had, and is continuing to have, wide-
ranging effects across multiple industries, particularly the automotive industry. Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors and to Part II, Item 7.
MD&A for further discussion on the effect the global semiconductor supply shortage has had on our results of operations.
In some instances, we purchase systems, components, parts and supplies from a single source, which may increase risk to supply
disruptions. The inability or unwillingness of these sources to provide us with parts and supplies could have a material adverse effect
on our production. Combined purchases from our two largest suppliers were approximately 12% of total purchases in the year ended
December 31, 2021, and approximately 11% of our total purchases in each of the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. Refer to
Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion of these risks.
Our transition to EVs includes a resilient, scalable and more sustainable North America-focused EV supply chain. Certain of the
initiatives we have advanced in 2021 include sourcing silicon carbide power device solutions for GM’s EV programs, processing
cathode active material, sourcing U.S. lithium with more sustainable extraction methods and sourcing permanent magnets using
locally sourced raw materials.
Automotive Financing - GM Financial GM Financial is our global captive automotive finance company and our global provider of
automobile finance solutions. GM Financial conducts its business in North America, South America and through joint ventures in
China.
GM Financial provides retail loan and lease lending across the credit spectrum to support vehicle sales. Additionally, GM
Financial offers commercial lending products to dealers including floorplan financing, which is lending to finance new and used
vehicle inventory; and dealer loans, which are loans to finance improvements to dealership facilities, to provide working capital, or
to purchase and/or finance dealership real estate. Other commercial lending products include financing for parts and accessories,
dealer fleets and storage centers.
In North America, GM Financial offers a sub-prime lending program. The program is primarily offered to consumers with a FICO
score or its equivalent of less than 620 who have limited access to automobile financing through banks and credit unions and is
expected to sustain a higher level of credit losses than prime lending.
GM Financial generally seeks to fund its operations in each country through local sources of funding to minimize currency and
country risk. GM Financial primarily finances its loan, lease and commercial origination volume through the use of secured and
unsecured credit facilities, securitization transactions and the issuance of unsecured debt in the capital markets.

Human Capital
The foundation of GM’s business is our Purpose: We pioneer the innovations that move and connect people to what matters. It's
why we exist. Our Purpose, growth strategy and culture all help us on our path towards achieving our vision of — a world with zero
crashes, zero emissions and zero congestion. Our people are our most valuable asset, and we must continue to attract and retain the
best talent in the world in order to achieve this vision. As a result, we strive to create a Workplace of Choice to attract, retain and
develop top talent by adhering to a responsible employer philosophy, which includes, among other things, commitments to create job
opportunities, pay workers fairly, ensure safety and well-being, and promote diversity, equity and inclusion. Fundamental to these
commitments are our company values.
Our eight GM behaviors are the foundation of our culture; and how we behave encompasses key measures of our performance,
including the visible ways we conduct ourselves as we work with one another.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion At GM, we are committed to fostering a culture of diversity, equity and inclusion. In every
moment, we must decide what we can do — individually and collectively — to drive meaningful, deliberate and long-lasting
change. GM’s unwavering commitment in this regard includes taking steps to ensure that all areas of our business are

supportive of a world-class inclusive, equitable and diverse organization. Our ability to meet the needs of a diverse and global
customer base is tied closely to the behaviors of the people within our company, which is why we are committed to fostering a
culture that celebrates our differences. This commitment is embraced at all levels of the organization, including our diverse Board of
Directors, which is currently made up of more than 50% women (7 out of 13 members) and is more than 30% racially or ethnically
diverse (4 out of 13 members). In alignment with these commitments, GM publicly disclosed its EEO-1 Consolidated Report for the
first time in 2021.
Based on these longstanding values, our Chair and CEO, Mary Barra, chairs an Inclusion Advisory Board (IAB) of internal and
external leaders who guide our work to improve diversity and inclusion in our Company. The purpose of the IAB is to consult with
GM’s Senior Leadership Team with the long-term goal of inspiring the Company to be inclusive through our words, deeds and
culture. We also have a number of programs and partnerships aimed at enhancing our culture of inclusion throughout the Company.
For example, we have 11 voluntary, employee-led resource groups that provide a forum for diverse employees and allies from a
variety of different backgrounds to share experiences and express concerns. Each group also works to attract new talent to our
company and offers employees opportunities to support our company’s diversity initiatives within the community.
In addition, we are expanding our partnerships with organizations aimed at supporting our ongoing efforts to increase the
representation of women and underrepresented groups in our workplace. Through our participation in the Business Roundtable
Multiple Pathways Initiative and OneTen, for example, we are specifically aiming to build more robust pipelines for skills-based
hiring into our company while ensuring long-term developmental opportunity.
Develop and Retain Talented People Today, we compete for talent against other automotive companies and against businesses in
other sectors, such as technology. To win and keep top talent, we must provide a workplace culture that encourages employee
behaviors aligned with our values, fulfills their long-term individual aspirations and provides experiences that make individuals feel
valued, included and engaged. In furtherance of this goal, we invest significant resources to retain and develop our talent. In addition
to mentoring and networking opportunities, we offer a vast array of career development resources to help develop, grow and enable
employees to make the most of their careers at GM. Formal resources include, among other things, the Technical Education
Program, which offers our employees an opportunity to complete corporate strategically aligned degrees and certificate programs at
leading universities, and our Degreed Learning Platform, which brings forth a variety of external and in-house content in learning
pathways and other micro learnings. It is also tied to our GM Competency and skills model. Employees in some of our technical
roles also have the opportunity to participate in the GM Technical Learning University — a training and upskilling program
designed to expand and update the technical prowess of our workforce.
GM recognizes that leadership effectiveness is a critical business need. All new managers in the Company are automatically
entered into a six-month immersive learning program and all new executives come together annually for a week-long upskilling and
targeted development program designed around the GM leadership profile.
Safety and Well-Being The safety and well-being of our employees is also a critical component of our ability to transform the
future of personal mobility. At GM, we pride ourselves on our commitment to live values that return people home safely — Every
Person, Every Site, Every Day. Our unwavering commitment to safety is manifested through empowering employees to “Speak Up
for Safety” through various means without fear of retaliation. The well-being of our employees is equally as important to entice and
stimulate creativity and innovation. In addition to traditional healthcare, paid time off, paid parental leave, wellness programs,
flextime scheduling and telecommuting arrangements and retirement benefits, including a 401(k) matching program, GM offers a
variety of benefits and resources to support employees' physical and mental health, including access to fitness facilities in certain
locations, which help us both attract talent and reap the benefits of a healthier workforce. In addition, leveraging our experience with
remote work during the COVID-19 pandemic, GM recently instituted “Work Appropriately,” a policy whereby, depending on the
nature of their work, our employees have the flexibility to work where they can have the greatest impact to achieve their goals and
for their individual success.

Environmental and Regulatory Matters
Automotive Criteria Emissions Control Our products are subject to laws and regulations globally that require us to control certain
non-GHG automotive emissions, including vehicle and engine exhaust emission standards, vehicle evaporative emission standards
and onboard diagnostic (OBD) system requirements. Emission requirements have become more stringent as a result of stricter
standards and new diagnostic requirements that have come into force in many markets around the world, often with very little
harmonization. Regulatory authorities may conduct ongoing evaluations of products from all manufacturers. For additional
information, refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors.

GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES
The U.S. federal government, through the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), imposes stringent exhaust and evaporative
emission control requirements on vehicles sold in the U.S. The California Air Resources Board (CARB) likewise imposes stringent
exhaust and evaporative emission standards. The Clean Air Act permits states that have areas with air quality compliance issues to
adopt California emission standards in lieu of federal requirements. Seventeen states and the District of Columbia have adopted
California emission standards, and there is a possibility that additional U.S. jurisdictions could adopt California emission
requirements in the future.
For each model year we must obtain certification that our vehicles and heavy-duty engines will meet emission requirements of the
EPA before we can sell vehicles in the U.S. and Canada, and of CARB before we can sell vehicles in California and the states that
have adopted California emission requirements.
The Canadian federal government's current vehicle pollutant emission requirements are generally aligned with U.S. federal
requirements.
In 2019, certain areas within China began implementation of the China 6 emission standard (China 6) requirements. China 6
combines elements of both European Union (EU) and U.S. standards and increases the time and mileage periods over which
manufacturers are responsible for a vehicle's emission performance. Nationwide implementation of China 6a for new registrations
occurred in January 2021, and the more stringent China 6b is expected to be implemented in July 2023.
Brazil has approved a set of national emission standards referred to as L7, to be implemented in 2022, and L8, to be implemented
from 2025 onward. L7 standards cover tailpipe exhaust gases, durability for emissions, evaporative emissions and noise limits, and
include additional OBD requirements and a phase-in for onboard refueling vapor recovery systems. L8 standards include targets for
vehicle emissions and reduce corporate exhaust limits every two years until 2031. Some of the requirements are aligned with those
of the EPA.
As a result of the sale of the Opel and Vauxhall businesses and certain other assets in Europe (Opel/Vauxhall Business), GM’s
vehicle presence in Europe is smaller, but GM may still be affected by actions taken by regulators related both to Opel/Vauxhall
vehicles sold before the sale of the Opel/Vauxhall Business as well as to other vehicles GM continues to sell in Europe. In the EU,
increased scrutiny of compliance with emission standards may result in changes to these standards, as well as stricter interpretations
or redefinition of these standards and more rigorous enforcement. For example, our former German subsidiary has participated in
continuing discussions with German and European authorities concerning emissions control systems. Beyond this, as a part of the
EU’s desire to accelerate the shift to sustainable mobility, the EU is looking to develop stricter emission standards (Euro 7) for all
petrol and diesel cars, vans, lorries and buses, as well as reform CO2 standards, and place requirements on batteries to be used in
EVs. For additional information, refer to Note 16 to our consolidated financial statements.
Automotive Fuel Economy and GHG Emissions In the U.S., NHTSA promulgates and enforces Corporate Average Fuel
Economy (CAFE) standards for three separate fleets: domestic cars, import cars and light-duty trucks. Manufacturers are subject to
substantial civil penalties if they fail to meet the applicable CAFE standard in any model year, after considering all available credits
for the preceding five model years, expected credits for the three succeeding model years and credits obtained from other
manufacturers. In addition to federal CAFE standards, the EPA promulgates and enforces GHG emission standards. In March 2020,
NHTSA and the EPA issued a rule setting fuel economy and GHG emission standards for light-duty vehicles through the 2026 model
year. Those actions are currently being challenged through litigation; however, the litigation is currently held in abeyance as the
agencies have since proposed new, more stringent light-duty CAFE and GHG standards. Though NHTSA and the EPA have
previously issued joint CAFE and GHG standards, the agencies have now separately proposed, and the EPA has finalized, standards
with differing stringency levels and affected model years, with the proposed CAFE standards addressing the 2024-2026 model years
and the GHG standards addressing the 2023-2026 model years. NHTSA and the EPA also regulate the fuel efficiency and GHG
emissions of medium- and heavy-duty vehicles, imposing more stringent standards over time.
In addition, CARB has asserted the right to promulgate and enforce its own state GHG standards for motor vehicles, and other
states have asserted the right to adopt CARB's standards. CARB regulations previously stated that compliance with the light-duty
EPA GHG program is deemed compliance with CARB standards. However, in December 2018 CARB amended this regulation to
state that, in the event the EPA were to alter federal GHG stringency, which it now has, compliance with the EPA's GHG emission
standards will no longer be deemed compliance with CARB's separate requirements. In September 2019, NHTSA issued a rule
asserting that California is preempted from regulating GHG emissions. Litigation challenging that rule is currently being held in
abeyance, as the EPA has since proposed, and NHTSA has finalized, actions that could result in a restoration of California’s ability
to promulgate and enforce its own state GHG standards. Depending on the outcome of the
10
Table of Contents
GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES
federal CAFE and GHG rulemakings and related litigation and the finality of CARB's regulatory amendment, in the future GM
might be required to meet differing EPA GHG, California GHG and CAFE standards.
CARB has also imposed the requirement that increasing percentages of Zero Emission Vehicles (ZEVs) must be sold in
California. The Clean Air Act permits states to adopt California emission standards, and 14 have adopted the ZEV requirements. In
September 2019, the EPA revoked the waiver it had granted to California that permitted its ZEV program, and NHTSA also asserted
preemption of California's ZEV program. Litigation over EPA and NHTSA's actions is currently being held in abeyance, as EPA and
NHTSA have since proposed actions that could result in a restoration of California’s ability to promulgate and enforce ZEV
standards. Depending on any final agency action taken by the EPA and NHTSA, and/or the outcome of the related litigation, there is
a possibility that additional U.S. jurisdictions could adopt California ZEV requirements in the future.
In Canada, light- and heavy-duty GHG regulations are currently patterned after the EPA GHG emission standards given the
integrated nature of the auto sector between Canada and the United States. The Canadian government is conducting a mid-term
review of its 2022 to 2025 model year light-duty GHG standards and is considering regulatory developments of the U.S. in this
regard. In addition, the Canadian province of Quebec has ZEV requirements regulating the 2018 to 2025 model years largely based
on California program requirements and the province of British Columbia’s similar ZEV regulations that were completed in July
2020 and cover the 2020 to 2039 model years. Both provinces are further updating their ZEV regulations and the Canadian federal
government recently proposed to ban the sale of ICE vehicles in Canada beginning in 2035, although no specific draft regulations
have been shared at this time.
China has two fuel economy requirements for passenger vehicles: an individual vehicle pass-fail type approval requirement and a
fleet average fuel consumption requirement. With a focus on the fleet average fuel consumption requirement, the China Phase 5
launched in 2021 and full compliance is required by 2025. In addition, China has established a mandate that requires passenger car
manufacturers to produce a certain volume of plug-in hybrid, battery electric and fuel cell vehicles, which are referred to as New
Energy Vehicles (NEVs), to generate credits in 2019 and beyond. The number of credits per car is based on the level of electric
range and energy efficiency, with the goal of increasing NEV volume penetrations and improving technological sophistication over
time. Uncommitted NEV credits may be used to assist compliance with the fleet average fuel consumption requirement. China has
issued NEV credit targets between 2019 and 2023 and is setting new NEV credit targets aimed at further increasing volumes of
NEVs in 2024 and 2025. China has provided various levels of subsidies for NEVs, and certain subsidies have been extended to the
end of 2022.
In Brazil, the Secretary of Industry and Development promulgates and enforces CAFE standards and has enforced a new CAFE
program for the period October 2020 to September 2026 and October 2026 to September 2032 for light-duty and mid-size trucks and
SUVs, including diesel vehicles, imposing more stringent standards for each period.
We have several options to comply with existing and potential new global regulations. Such options include increasing production
and sale of certain vehicles, such as EVs, and curtailing production of less fuel efficient ICE vehicles; technology changes, including
fuel consumption efficiency and engine upgrades; payment of penalties; and/or purchase of credits from third parties. We regularly
evaluate our current and future product plans and strategies for compliance with fuel economy and GHG regulations.
We plan to be carbon neutral by 2040 in our global products and operations, supported by a commitment to science-based targets.
In addition, the Company announced our vision of an all-electric future and our plan to eliminate tailpipe emissions from new light-
duty vehicles by 2035. These targets align with our growth and transformation plan including our commitment to an all-electric
future, which will be enabled by our Ultium platform and HYDROTEC technology as previously detailed. We also announced, in
June 2021, our plans to increase our investment in EVs and AVs to more than $35.0 billion through 2025 to accelerate this
transformation plan.
Industrial Environmental Control Our operations are subject to a wide range of environmental protection laws including those
regulating air emissions, water discharge, waste management and environmental cleanup. Certain environmental statutes require that
responsible parties fund remediation actions regardless of fault, legality of original disposal or ownership of a disposal site. Under
certain circumstances these laws impose joint and several liability as well as liability for related damages to natural resources.
To mitigate the effects of our worldwide operations on the environment, including climate change, we are embracing sustainability
programs focused on reducing operational GHG emissions, water consumption and discharge and waste disposal.

In 2021, we launched our new global GM Zero Waste program, with a goal to divert waste from landfills and incinerators. For the
year ended December 31, 2021, GM's facilities included in the global GM Zero Waste program diverted over 1.1 million metric tons
of waste from landfills and incinerators through composting, reusing and recycling.
In addition to reducing our impact on the environment, our waste reduction commitments generate income from the sale of
production by-products, reduce our use of raw materials and help to reduce the risks and financial liabilities associated with waste
disposal.
We continue our efforts to increase our use of renewable energy, improve our energy efficiency and work to drive growth and
scale of renewables. To that end, we have set a goal of meeting the electricity needs of our operations with 100% renewable
by 2025 in the U.S., a goal we recently accelerated from 2030, and by 2035 globally.
Through December 31, 2021, we implemented projects and signed renewable energy contracts globally that brought our total
renewable energy capacity to over one gigawatt by 2023, which represents approximately 75% of our U.S. electricity use and
approximately 40% of our global electricity use. In 2019 and 2020, we executed two of our largest green tariffs to date with DTE
Energy Company, sourcing 840,000 megawatt hours of renewable energy that began supplying us in early 2021 in phase 1 with the
remainder expected in mid-2023 in phase 2. Additionally, in 2020 we executed our largest power purchase agreement to date, with
180 megawatts of solar electricity supplying our U.S. operations starting in 2023. We continue to seek opportunities for a diversified
renewable energy portfolio including wind, solar and landfill gas, including executing a 28 megawatts solar green tariff with TVA to
supply our Bowling Green Assembly Plant. In 2021, Energy Star certified two assembly plants and four buildings in the U.S. for
superior energy management. We also met the EPA Energy Star Challenge for Industry (EPA Challenge) at five additional sites by
reducing energy intensity an average of 15% at these sites within two years. To meet the EPA Challenge, industrial sites must reduce
energy intensity by 10% within a five year period. In total, 69 GM-owned manufacturing sites have met the EPA Challenge, with
many sites achieving the goal multiple times for a total of 132 recognitions. Additionally, we received recognition from the U.S.
Department of Energy (DOE) of 50001 Ready status for 25 facilities. The U.S. DOE 50001 Ready program is a self-guided approach
for facilities to establish an energy management system and self-attest to the structure of ISO 50001, a voluntary global standard for
energy management systems in industrial, commercial and institutional facilities. These sustainability efforts reduce our operational
expenses and are part of our approach to improve the sustainability of our operations by aligning our business strategy with
aggressive environmental goals and reduction targets, collecting accurate data, and publicly reporting progress against our targets.
Chemical Regulations We continually monitor the implementation of chemical regulations to maintain compliance and evaluate
their effect on our business, suppliers and the automotive industry.
Globally, governments continue to introduce new legislation and regulations related to the selection and use of chemicals by
mandating broad prohibitions or restrictions and implementing vehicle interior air quality, green chemistry, life cycle analysis and
product stewardship initiatives. These initiatives give broad regulatory authority to ban or restrict the use of certain chemical
substances and potentially affect automobile manufacturers' responsibilities for vehicle components at the end of a vehicle's life, as
well as chemical selection for product development and manufacturing. Global treaties and initiatives such as the Stockholm, Basel
and Rotterdam Conventions on Chemicals and Waste and the Minamata Convention on Mercury, are driving chemical regulations
across signatory countries. Increases in the use of circuit boards and other electronics may require additional assessment under the
Restriction on Hazardous Substances and Waste from Electrical and Electronic Equipment directives. New European requirements
require suppliers of parts and vehicles to the European market to disclose Substances of Concern in Parts.
Chemical regulations are increasing in North America. In the U.S., the EPA is moving forward with risk analysis and management
of high priority chemicals under the authority of the 2016 Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act. In addition, several
U.S. states have chemical management regulations that can affect vehicle design and manufacturing such as chemical restriction and
use requirements. Chemical restrictions and export controls in Canada continue to steadily progress under the Environment and
Climate Change Canada's Chemical Management Plan to assess existing substances and implement risk management controls on
any chemical deemed toxic.
These emerging laws and regulations will potentially lead to increases in costs and supply chain complexity. Manufacturers,
including joint venture partners and suppliers, that do not comply with global and specific country regulations could be subject to
civil penalties, production disruptions, or limitations on the sale of affected products. We believe we are materially in compliance
with substantially all these requirements or expect to be materially in compliance by the required dates.

Vehicle Safety
U.S. Requirements The National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966 (the Safety Act) regulates the vehicles and items of
motor vehicle equipment that we manufacture and sell. The Safety Act prohibits the sale in the United States of any new vehicle or
equipment that does not conform to applicable federal motor vehicle safety standards established by NHTSA. Meeting or exceeding
the many safety standards is costly as global compliance and non-governmental assessment requirements continue to evolve and
grow more complex, and lack harmonization globally. The Safety Act further requires that if we or NHTSA determine a vehicle or
an item of vehicle equipment does not comply with a safety standard, or that vehicle or equipment contains a defect that poses an
unreasonable safety risk, we must conduct a safety recall to remedy that condition in the affected vehicles. Should we or NHTSA
determine a safety defect or noncompliance issue exists with respect to any of our vehicles, the cost of such recall campaigns could
be substantial.
Other National Requirements Outside of the U.S., many countries have established vehicle safety standards and regulations and
are likely to adopt additional, more stringent requirements in the future. The European General Safety Regulation has introduced
United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UN-ECE) regulations, which are required for the European Type Approval
process. Globally, governments generally have been adopting UN-ECE based regulations with some variations to address local
concerns. Any difference between North American and UN-ECE based regulations can add complexity and costs to vehicle
development, and we continue to support efforts to harmonize regulations to reduce complexity. New safety and recall requirements
in various countries around the world, including in China, Brazil, and Gulf Cooperation Council countries, also may add substantial
costs and complexity to our safety and field action activities globally. In Canada, vehicle regulatory requirements are currently
aligned with U.S. regulations; however, under the Canadian Motor Vehicle Safety Act, recall thresholds are different and the
Minister of Transport has broad powers to order manufacturers to submit a notice of defect or non-compliance when the Minister
considers it to be in the interest of safety. Further, various governments are beginning to mandate e-Call and other features that can
be market-specific and add complexity and increase our cost of compliance globally.
Crash Test Ratings and New Car Assessment Programs Organizations in various regions around the world, including in the U.S.,
rate and compare motor vehicles through various New Car Assessment Programs (NCAPs) to provide consumers and businesses
with additional information about the safety of new vehicles. NCAPs use crash tests and other evaluations that are different than
what is required by applicable regulations, and use stars to rate vehicle safety, with five stars awarded for the highest rating and one
for the lowest. Achieving high NCAP ratings, which can vary by country and region, can add complexity and cost to vehicles.

GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES
Item 1A. Risk Factors
We have listed below the most material risk factors applicable to us. These risk factors are not necessarily in the order of
importance or probability of occurrence:
Risks related to our competition and strategy
If we do not deliver new products, services, technologies and customer experiences in response to increased competition and
changing consumer preferences in the automotive industry, our business could suffer. We believe that the automotive industry
will continue to experience significant change in the coming years, particularly as traditional automotive original equipment
manufacturers shift resources to the development of EVs. In addition to our traditional competitors, we must also be responsive to
the entrance of start-ups and other non-traditional competitors in the automotive industry. These new competitors, as well as
established industry participants, are disrupting the historic business model of our industry through the introduction of new
technologies, products, services, direct-to-consumer sales channels, methods of transportation and vehicle ownership. To
successfully execute our long-term strategy, we must continue to develop new products and services, including products and services
that are outside of our historically core ICE business, such as EVs and AVs, software-enabled connected services and other new
businesses.
Our vehicles and connected services increasingly rely on software and hardware that is highly technical and complex. The process
of designing and developing new technology, products and services is costly and uncertain and requires extensive capital investment
and the ability to retain and recruit the best talent. If our access to capital were to become significantly constrained, if costs of capital
increased significantly, or if our ability to raise capital is challenged relative to our peers, in each case including as a result of any
constraints on lending due to concerns about climate change, our ability to execute on our strategic plans could be adversely
affected. Further, the market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive. Failure to attract, hire,
develop, motivate and retain highly qualified and diverse employees could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our strategic
plans.
There can be no assurance that advances in technology will occur in a timely or feasible way, if at all, that others will not acquire
similar or superior technologies sooner than we do, or that we will acquire technologies on an exclusive basis or at a significant price
advantage. Further, if we are unable to prevent or effectively remedy errors, bugs, vulnerabilities or defects in our software and
hardware, or fail to deploy updates to our software properly, or if we do not adequately prepare for and respond to new kinds of
technological innovations, market developments and changing customer needs, our sales, profitability and long-term
competitiveness may be harmed.
Our ability to maintain profitability is dependent upon our ability to timely fund and introduce new and improved vehicle
models, including EVs, that are able to attract a sufficient number of consumers. We operate in a very competitive industry with
market participants routinely introducing new and improved vehicle models and features designed to meet rapidly evolving
consumer expectations. Producing new and improved vehicle models, including EVs, that preserve our reputation for designing,
building and selling safe, high-quality cars, trucks and SUVs is critical to our long-term profitability. Successful launches of our new
vehicles are critical to our short-term profitability. The new vehicle development process can take two years or more, and a number
of factors may lengthen that time period. Because of this product development cycle and the various elements that may contribute to
consumers’ acceptance of new vehicle designs, including competitors’ product introductions, technological innovations, fuel prices,
general economic conditions, regulatory developments, transportation infrastructure and changes in quality, safety, reliability and
styling demands and preferences, an initial product concept or design may not result in a saleable vehicle or a vehicle that generates
sales in sufficient quantities and at high enough prices to be profitable. Our high proportion of fixed costs, both due to our significant
investment in property, plant and equipment as well as other requirements of our collective bargaining agreements, which limit our
flexibility to adjust personnel costs to changes in demands for our products, may further exacerbate the risks associated with
incorrectly assessing demand for our vehicles.
Our long-term strategy is dependent upon our ability to profitably deliver a broad portfolio of EVs. The production and
profitable sale of EVs has become increasingly important to our long-term business as we accelerate our transition to an all-electric
future. In 2021, we increased our commitment to investments in EV and AV technologies to more than $35.0 billion from 2020
through 2025, with plans to launch more than 30 new EV models globally across several price points in that timeframe. Our EV
strategy is dependent on our ability to deliver a broad portfolio of high-quality EVs that are competitive and meet consumer
demands; reduce the costs associated with the manufacture of EVs, particularly with respect to batteries; increase vehicle range and
the energy density of our batteries; license and monetize our proprietary platforms and related innovations; successfully invest in
new technologies relative to our peers; develop new software and services; and leverage our scale, manufacturing capabilities and
synergies with existing ICE vehicles.

In addition, consumer adoption of EVs will be critical to the success of our strategy. Consumer adoption of EVs could be impacted
by numerous factors, including the breadth of the portfolio of EVs available; perceptions about EV features, quality, safety,
performance and cost relative to ICE vehicles; the range over which EVs may be driven on a full battery charge; the proliferation of
charging infrastructure, in particular with respect to public EV charging stations; cost and availability of high fuel-economy ICE
vehicles; volatility, or a sustained decrease, in the cost of petroleum-based fuel; failure by governments and other third parties to
make the investments necessary to make infrastructure improvements, such as greater availability of cleaner energy grids and EV
charging stations, and to provide economic incentives promoting the adoption of EVs; and negative feedback from stakeholders
impacting investor and consumer confidence in our company or industry. If we are unable to successfully deliver on our EV strategy,
it could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and growth prospects, and could negatively
impact our brand and reputation.
Our near-term profitability is dependent upon the success of our current line of full-size ICE SUVs and full-size ICE pickup
trucks. While we offer a broad portfolio of cars, crossovers, SUVs and trucks, and we have announced significant plans to design,
build and sell a broad portfolio of EVs, we currently recognize higher profit margins on our full-size ICE SUVs and full-size ICE
trucks. Our near-term success is dependent upon our ability to sell higher margin vehicles in sufficient volumes. We also plan to use
the cash generated by our ICE vehicles to fund our growth strategy, including the development and sale of EVs and AVs. Any near-
term shift in consumer preferences toward smaller, more fuel-efficient vehicles, whether as a result of increases in the price of oil or
any sustained shortage of oil, including as a result of global political instability, concerns about climate change, including any
constraints related to lending on GHG-emitting products, or other reasons, could weaken the demand for our higher margin vehicles.
More stringent fuel economy regulations could also impact our ability to sell these vehicles or could result in additional costs
associated with these vehicles. See “Our operations and products are subject to extensive laws, regulations and policies, including
those related to vehicle emissions and fuel economy standards, which can significantly increase our costs and affect how we do
business.”
We operate in a highly competitive industry that has historically had excess manufacturing capacity, and attempts by our
competitors to sell more vehicles could have a significant negative effect on our vehicle pricing, market share and operating
results. The global automotive industry is highly competitive in terms of the quality, innovation, new technologies, pricing, fuel
economy, reliability, safety, customer service and financial services offered. Additionally, overall manufacturing capacity in the
industry has historically far exceeded demand. In addition, we have made, and plan to continue to make, significant investments in
EV manufacturing capacity based on our expectations for EV demand, which is subject to various risks and uncertainties as
described above. Many manufacturers, including GM, have relatively high fixed labor costs as well as limitations on their ability to
close facilities and reduce fixed costs, often as a result of collective bargaining agreements. In light of any excess capacity and high
fixed costs, many industry participants have attempted to sell more vehicles by providing subsidized financing or leasing programs,
offering marketing incentives or reducing vehicle prices. As a result, we may be required to offer similar incentives that may result
in vehicle prices that do not offset our costs, including any cost increases or the impact of adverse currency fluctuations, which could
affect our profitability. Our competitors may also seek to benefit from economies of scale by consolidating or entering into other
strategic agreements such as alliances or joint ventures intended to enhance their competitiveness.
Manufacturers in countries that have lower production costs, such as China and India, have become competitors in key emerging
markets and have announced their intention to export their products to established markets as a low-cost alternative to established
entry-level automobiles. In addition, foreign governments may decide to implement tax and other policies that favor their domestic
manufacturers at the expense of international manufacturers, including GM and its joint venture partners. These actions have had,
and are expected to continue to have, a significant negative effect on our vehicle pricing, market share and operating results in these
markets.
Our AV strategy is dependent upon our ability to successfully mitigate unique technological, operational and regulatory risks.
GM Cruise Holdings LLC (Cruise Holdings), our majority-owned subsidiary, is responsible for the development and
commercialization of AV technology. Our AV operations are capital intensive and subject to a variety of risks inherent with the
development of new technologies, including our ability to continue to develop self-driving software and hardware, such as Light
Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensors and other components; access to sufficient capital; risks related to the manufacture of
purpose-built AVs; and significant competition from both established automotive companies and technology companies, some of
which may have more resources and capital to devote to AV technologies than we do. In addition, we face risks related to the
commercial deployment of AVs on our targeted timeline or at all, including consumer acceptance, achievement of adequate safety
and other performance standards and compliance with uncertain, evolving and potentially conflicting federal and state or provincial
regulations. To the extent accidents, cybersecurity breaches or other adverse events associated with our autonomous driving systems
occur, we could be subject to liability, reputational harm, government scrutiny and further regulation, and it could deter consumer
adoption of AV technology. Any of the foregoing could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition
and growth prospects.

GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES
We are subject to risks associated with climate change, including increased regulation of GHG emissions, changing consumer
preferences and other risks related to our transition to EVs and the potential increased impacts of severe weather events on our
operations and infrastructure. Increasing attention to climate change, increasing societal expectations on companies to address
climate change and changes in consumer preferences may result in increased costs, reduced demand for our products, reduced
profits, risks associated with new regulatory requirements and the potential for increased litigation and governmental investigations.
Climate change regulations at the federal, state or local level or in international jurisdictions could require us to further limit
emissions associated with customer use of products we sell, change our manufacturing processes or product portfolio or undertake
other activities that may require us to incur additional expense, which may be material. These requirements may increase the cost of,
and/or diminish demand for, our ICE vehicles. See “Our operations and products are subject to extensive laws, regulations and
policies, including those related to vehicle emissions and fuel economy standards, which can significantly increase our costs and
affect how we do business.”
Part of our strategy to address these risks includes our transition to EVs, which presents additional risks, including reduced
demand for, and therefore profits from, our ICE vehicles, which we plan to use to fund our growth strategy; higher costs related to
EV technologies impacting profitability compared to ICE vehicles; and risks related to the success of our EV strategy. See “Our
long-term strategy is dependent upon our ability to profitably deliver a broad portfolio of EVs” and “Our near-term profitability is
dependent upon the success of our current line of full-size ICE SUVs and full-size ICE pickup trucks.”
Finally, increased intensity, frequency or duration of storms, droughts or other severe weather events as a result of climate change
may disrupt our production and the production, logistics, cost and procurement of products from our suppliers and timely delivery of
vehicles to customers, and could negatively impact working conditions at our plants and those of our suppliers. Any of the foregoing
could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
Risks related to our operations
Our business is highly dependent upon global automobile market sales volume, which can be volatile. Because we have a high
proportion of relatively fixed structural costs, small changes in sales volume can have a disproportionately large effect on our
profitability. A number of economic and market conditions drive changes in new vehicle sales, including disruptions in the new
vehicle supply chain, the availability and prices of used vehicles, levels of unemployment and inflation, availability of affordable
financing, fluctuations in the cost of fuel, consumer confidence and demand for vehicles, political unrest or uncertainty, the
occurrence of a contagious disease or illness, including COVID-19, barriers to trade and other global economic conditions. For a
discussion of economic and market trends, see the "Overview" section in Part II, Item 7. MD&A. Any significant decrease in new
vehicle sales could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
High prices and uncertain availability of commodities, raw materials or other inputs used by us and our suppliers, or instability
in logistics and related costs, could negatively impact our profitability. Increases in prices for commodities, raw materials or other
inputs that we and our suppliers use in manufacturing products, systems, components and parts, such as steel, precious metals, non-
ferrous metals, critical minerals or other similar raw materials, or increases in logistics and related costs, may lead to higher
production costs for parts, components and vehicles. In addition, any increase in the cost of critical materials for our EV propulsion
systems, including lithium, nickel, cobalt and certain rare earth metals, could lead to higher production costs for our EVs and could
impede our ability to successfully deliver on our EV strategy. Further, increasing global demand for, and uncertain supply of, such
materials could disrupt our or our suppliers’ ability to obtain such materials in a timely manner and/or could lead to increased costs.
Geopolitical risk, fluctuations in supply and demand, any weakening of the U.S. dollar and other economic and political factors may
continue to create pricing pressure for commodities, raw materials and other inputs. These inflationary pressures could, in turn,
negatively impact our future profitability because we may not be able to pass all of those costs on to our customers or require our
suppliers to absorb such costs.
Our business in China subjects us to unique operational, competitive and regulatory risks. Pursuing opportunities in the
Chinese market is an important component of our global growth strategy. Our business in China is subject to aggressive competition
from many of the largest global manufacturers and numerous domestic manufacturers as well as non-traditional market participants,
such as domestic technology companies. In addition, our success in China depends upon our ability to adequately address unique
market and consumer preferences driven by advancements related to EVs, infotainment, software-enabled connected services and
other new technologies. Our ability to fully deploy our technologies in China may be impacted by evolving laws and regulations in
the U.S. and China. Increased competition, continued U.S.-China trade tensions or weakening economic conditions in China, among
other factors, may result in cost increases, price reductions, reduced sales, profitability and margins, and challenges to gaining or
holding market share.
Certain risks and uncertainties of doing business in China are solely within the control of the Chinese government, and Chinese
law regulates the scope of our investments and business conducted within China. In order to maintain access to the Chinese market,
we may be required to comply with significant technical and other regulatory requirements that are unique to the Chinese market, at
times with challenging lead times. These actions may increase the cost of doing business in China or
16
Table of Contents
GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES
limit how and under what conditions we may do business in China, which could materially and adversely affect our profitability and
financial condition.
We benefit from many ongoing strategic business relationships, and a significant amount of our operations are conducted by
joint ventures, which we cannot operate solely for our benefit. We are engaged in many strategic business relationships, and we
expect that such arrangements will continue to be an important factor in the growth and success of our business, particularly in light
of industry consolidation. However, there are no assurances that we will be able to identify or secure suitable business relationships
in the future or that our competitors will not capitalize on such opportunities before we do, or that any strategic business
relationships that we enter into will be successful. If we are unable to successfully source and execute on strategic business
relationships in the future, our overall growth could be impaired, and our business, prospects and results of operations could be
materially adversely affected.
In addition, many of our operations, primarily in China and Korea as well as our battery manufacturing operations with LG
Energy Solution, are carried out by joint ventures. In joint ventures we share ownership and management of a company with one or
more parties who may not have the same goals, strategies, priorities or resources as we do and may compete with us outside the joint
venture. Joint ventures are intended to be operated for the benefit of all co-owners, rather than for our exclusive benefit. Operating a
business as a joint venture often requires additional organizational formalities as well as time-consuming procedures for sharing
information and making decisions that must further take into consideration our partners' interests. In joint ventures we are required
to foster our relationships with our co-owners as well as promote the overall success of the joint venture, and if a co-owner changes,
relationships deteriorate or strategic objectives diverge, our success in the joint venture may be materially adversely affected.
Further, the benefits from a successful joint venture are shared among the co-owners, therefore we do not receive all the benefits
from our successful joint ventures.
In addition, because we share ownership and management with one or more parties, we may have limited control over the actions
of a joint venture, particularly when we own a minority interest. As a result, we may be unable to prevent violations of applicable
laws or other misconduct by a joint venture or the failure to satisfy contractual obligations by one or more parties. Moreover, a joint
venture may not follow the same requirements regarding compliance, internal controls and internal control over financial reporting
that we follow. To the extent another party makes decisions that negatively impact the joint venture or internal control issues arise
within the joint venture, we may have to take responsive actions, or we may be subject to penalties, fines or other punitive actions
for these activities.
The international scale and footprint of our operations expose us to additional risks. We manufacture, sell and service products
globally and rely upon an integrated global supply chain to deliver the raw materials, components, systems and parts that we need to
manufacture our products. Our global operations subject us to extensive domestic and foreign legal and regulatory requirements, and
a variety of other political, economic and regulatory risks, including: (1) changes in government leadership; (2) changes in trade
compliance, labor, employment, tax, privacy, environmental and other laws, regulations or government policies impacting our
overall business model or practices or restricting our ability to manufacture, purchase or sell products consistent with market
demand and our business objectives; (3) political pressures to change any aspect of our business model or practices or that impair
our ability to source raw materials, services, components, systems and parts, or manufacture products on competitive terms in a
manner consistent with our business objectives; (4) political uncertainty, instability, civil unrest or government controls over certain
sectors; (5) political and economic tensions between governments and changes in international economic policies, including
restrictions on the repatriation of dividends or in the export of technology, especially between China and the U.S.; (6) changes to
customs requirements or procedures (e.g., inspections) or new or higher tariffs, for example, on products imported into or exported
from the U.S., including under U.S. or other trade laws or measures; (7) new non-tariff barriers to entry or domestic preference
procurement requirements, or enforcement of, changes to, withdrawals from or impediments to implementing free trade agreements
(for example, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement), or preferences of foreign nationals for domestically manufactured
products; (8) changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly in Brazil and Argentina, and interest rates; (9) economic
downturns or significant changes in conditions in the countries in which we operate; (10) differing local product preferences and
product requirements, including government certification requirements related to, among other things, fuel economy, vehicle
emissions, EVs and AVs, connected services and safety; (11) impact of changes to and compliance with U.S. and foreign countries’
export controls, economic sanctions and other similar measures; (12) liabilities resulting from U.S. and foreign laws and regulations,
including, but not limited to, those related to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and certain other anti-corruption laws; (13) differing
labor regulations, agreements, requirements and union relationships; (14) differing dealer and franchise regulations and
relationships; (15) difficulties in obtaining financing in foreign countries for local operations; and (16) natural disasters, public
health crises, including the occurrence of a contagious disease or illness, such as COVID-19, and other catastrophic events.
Any significant disruption at one of our manufacturing facilities could disrupt our production schedule. We assemble vehicles
at various facilities around the world. Our facilities are typically designed to produce particular models for particular geographic
markets. No single facility is designed to manufacture our full range of vehicles. In some cases, certain facilities produce products,
systems, components and parts that disproportionately contribute a greater degree to our profitability than
17
Table of Contents
GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES
others and create significant interdependencies among manufacturing facilities around the world. Should these or other facilities
become unavailable either temporarily or permanently for any number of reasons, including labor disruptions, supply chain
disruptions, the occurrence of a contagious disease or illness, such as COVID-19, or catastrophic weather events, whether or not as a
result of climate change, the inability to manufacture at the affected facility may result in harm to our reputation, increased costs,
lower revenues and the loss of customers. In particular, substantially all of our hourly employees are represented by unions and
covered by collective bargaining agreements that must be negotiated from time-to-time, including at the local facility level, which
increases our risk of work stoppages. We may not be able to easily shift production to other facilities or to make up for lost
production. Any new facility needed to replace an inoperable manufacturing facility would need to comply with the necessary
regulatory requirements, need to satisfy our specialized manufacturing requirements and require specialized equipment.
Any disruption in our suppliers’ operations could disrupt our production schedule. Our automotive operations are dependent
upon the continued ability of our suppliers to deliver the systems, components, raw materials and parts that we need to manufacture
our products. Our use of “just-in-time” manufacturing processes allows us to maintain minimal inventory. As a result, our ability to
maintain production is dependent upon our suppliers delivering sufficient quantities of systems, components, raw materials and parts
on time to meet our production schedules. In some instances, we purchase systems, components, raw materials and parts that are
ultimately derived from a single source and may be at an increased risk for supply disruptions. Any number of factors, including
labor disruptions, catastrophic weather events, the occurrence of a contagious disease or illness, such as COVID-19, contractual or
other disputes, unfavorable economic or industry conditions, delivery delays or other performance problems or financial difficulties
or solvency problems, could disrupt our suppliers’ operations and lead to uncertainty in our supply chain or cause supply disruptions
for us, which could, in turn, disrupt our operations, including the production of certain higher margin vehicles. If the COVID-19
pandemic continues to spread or re-emerges and results in a prolonged period of travel, commercial, social and other similar
restrictions, we could experience continued and/or additional global supply disruptions. If we experience supply disruptions, we may
not be able to develop alternate sourcing quickly. Any disruption of our production schedule caused by an unexpected shortage of
systems, components, raw materials or parts even for a relatively short period of time could cause us to alter production schedules,
increase work-in-process inventory or suspend production entirely, which could cause a loss of revenues or an increase in working
capital, which would adversely affect our profitability and financial condition.
In particular, a global semiconductor supply shortage has had, and is continuing to have, wide-ranging effects across multiple
industries, particularly the automotive industry, and it has impacted multiple suppliers that incorporate semiconductors into the parts
they supply to us. As a result, the semiconductor supply shortage has had, and depending on how long it persists, could continue to
have, a material impact on our operations.
The COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on the global economy may disrupt our business and operations, which could
materially adversely impact our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. Pandemics, epidemics or disease
outbreaks in the U.S. or globally may disrupt our business, which could materially affect our results of operations, financial
condition, liquidity and future expectations. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused, and is continuing to cause, significant disruption
to the global economy, including the automotive industry, and has had a material impact on our business. However, the full extent to
which the COVID-19 pandemic will impact our operations will depend on future developments, including the duration and severity
of the pandemic, any subsequent outbreaks of the virus or any related variants and the efficacy, availability and adoption of vaccines.
Future developments are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence and may adversely impact our global supply
chain and global manufacturing operations and cause us to again suspend our operations in the U.S. and elsewhere. In particular, if
the COVID-19 pandemic continues or re-emerges, particularly in North America where our profits are most concentrated, resulting
in a prolonged period of travel, commercial, social and other similar restrictions, we could experience among other things: (1)
continued or additional global supply disruptions, including a delayed recovery from the global semiconductor supply shortage; (2)
labor disruptions; (3) an inability to manufacture; (4) an inability to sell to our customers; (5) a decline in showroom traffic and
customer demand during and following the pandemic; (6) customer defaults on automobile loans and leases; (7) lower than expected
pricing on vehicles sold at auction; and (8) an impaired ability to access credit and the capital markets. We may also be subject to
enhanced legal risks, including potential litigation related to the COVID-19 pandemic. We also have substantial cash requirements
going forward, including: (1) ongoing cash costs including payments associated with previously announced vehicle recalls, the
settlements of multi-district litigation and other recall-related contingencies, payments to service debt and other long-term
obligations, including mandatory contributions to our pension plans; and (2) capital expenditures and payments for engineering and
product development activities. Our ability to meet these cash requirements may be negatively impacted by the ongoing COVID-19
pandemic. Any resulting financial impact or the duration of such impact cannot be reasonably estimated at this time, but the COVID-
19 pandemic could have a material impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations going forward.
We may continue to restructure our operations in the U.S. and various other countries and initiate additional cost reduction
actions, but we may not succeed in doing so. Since 2017, we have undertaken restructuring actions to lower our operating costs in
response to difficult market and operating conditions in various parts of the world, including the U.S.,
18
Table of Contents
GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES
Canada, Korea, Southeast Asia, India, Africa, Australia and New Zealand and Europe. As we continue to assess our performance
throughout our regions, we may take additional restructuring actions to rationalize our operations, which may result in material asset
write-downs or impairments and reduce our profitability in the periods incurred. In addition, these restructuring actions subject us to
increased risks of labor unrest or strikes, supplier, dealer, or other third-party litigation, regulator claims or proceedings, negative
publicity and business disruption. Failure to realize anticipated savings or benefits from our restructuring and/or cost reduction
actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity and cash flows.
Risks related to our intellectual property, cybersecurity, information technology and data management practices
Competitors may independently develop products and services similar to ours, and there are no guarantees that GM’s
intellectual property rights would prevent competitors from independently developing or selling those products and services.
There may be instances where, notwithstanding our intellectual property position, competitive products or services may impact the
value of our brands and other intangible assets, and our business may be adversely affected. Moreover, although GM takes
reasonable steps to maintain the confidentiality of GM proprietary information, there can be no assurance that such efforts will
completely deter or prevent misappropriation or improper use of our intellectual property. We sometimes face attempts to gain
unauthorized access to our information technology networks and systems for the purpose of improperly acquiring our trade secrets
or confidential business information. The theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business
information as a result of such an incident could adversely affect our competitive position. In addition, we may be the target of
patent enforcement actions by third parties, including aggressive and opportunistic enforcement claims by non-practicing entities.
Regardless of the merit of such claims, responding to infringement claims can be expensive and time-consuming. Although we have
taken steps to mitigate such risks, if we are found to have infringed any third-party intellectual property rights, we could be required
to pay substantial damages, or we could be enjoined from offering some of our products and services. In addition, to prevent
unauthorized use of our intellectual property, it may be necessary to prosecute actions for infringement, misappropriation or other
violation of our intellectual property against third parties. Any such action could result in significant costs and diversion of our
resources and management’s attention, and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in any such action.
Security breaches and other disruptions to information technology systems and networked products, including connected
vehicles, owned or maintained by us, GM Financial, or third-parties, such as vendors or suppliers, could interfere with our
operations and could compromise the confidentiality of private customer data or our proprietary information. We rely upon
information technology systems and manufacture networked and connected products, some of which are managed by third parties, to
process, transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of our business processes, activities and
products. Additionally, we and GM Financial collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property and proprietary business
information (including that of our dealers and suppliers), as well as personally identifiable information of our customers and
employees, in data centers and on information technology networks (including networks that may be controlled or maintained by
third parties). The secure operation of these systems and products, and the processing and maintenance of the information processed
by these systems and products, is critical to our business operations and strategy. Further, customers using our systems rely on the
security of our infrastructure, including hardware and other elements provided by third parties, to ensure the reliability of our
products and the protection of their data. We also face the risk of operational disruption, failure, termination or capacity constraints
of any of the third parties that facilitate our business activities, including vendors, service providers, suppliers, customers,
counterparties, exchanges, clearing agents, clearinghouses or other financial intermediaries. Such parties and other third parties who
provide us services or with whom we communicate could also be the source of a cyberattack on, or breach of, our operational
systems, network, data or infrastructure. Despite our security measures and business continuity plans, our information technology
systems and networked and connected products may be vulnerable to damage, disruptions or shutdowns caused by attacks by
hackers, computer viruses, malware (including “ransomware”), phishing attacks or breaches due to errors or malfeasance by
employees, contractors and others who have access to these systems and products. The occurrence of any of these events could
compromise the confidentiality, operational integrity and accessibility of these systems and products and the data that resides within
them. Similarly, such an occurrence could result in the compromise or loss of the information processed by these systems and
products. Such events could result in, among other things, the loss of proprietary data, interruptions or delays in our business
operations and damage to our reputation. In addition, such events could increase the risk of claims alleging that we are non-
compliant with applicable laws or regulations, subjecting us to potential liability or regulatory penalties and related costs under laws
protecting the privacy of personal information; disrupt our operations; or reduce the competitive advantage we hope to derive from
our investment in advanced technologies. Various events described above have occurred in the past and may occur in the future.
Although impacts of past events have been immaterial, the impacts of such events in the future may be material.
Security breaches and other disruptions of our in-vehicle systems could impact the safety of our customers and reduce
confidence in GM and our products. Our vehicles contain complex information technology systems. These systems control various
vehicle functions including engine, transmission, safety, steering, navigation, acceleration, braking, window, door lock functions and
battery and electric motors. We have designed, implemented and tested security measures intended to prevent
19
Table of Contents
GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES
unauthorized access to these systems. However, hackers have reportedly attempted, and may attempt in the future, to gain
unauthorized access to modify, alter and use such systems to gain control of, or to change, our vehicles’ functionality, user interface
and performance characteristics, or to gain access to data stored in or generated by the vehicle. Any unauthorized access to or control
of our vehicles or their systems could adversely impact the safety of our customers or result in legal claims or proceedings, liability
or regulatory penalties. Laws that would permit third-party access to vehicle data and related systems could expose our vehicles and
vehicle systems to third-party access without appropriate security measures in place, leading to new safety and security risks for our
customers and reducing customer trust and confidence in our products. In addition, regardless of their veracity, reports of
unauthorized access to our vehicles or their systems could negatively affect our brand and harm our reputation, which could
adversely impact our business and operating results.
Our enterprise data practices, including the collection, use, sharing and security of the Personal Identifiable Information of
our customers, employees and suppliers, are subject to increasingly complex and restrictive regulations in all key market regions.
Under these regulations, the failure to maintain compliant data practices could result in consumer complaints and regulatory inquiry,
resulting in civil or criminal penalties, as well as brand impact or other harm to our business. In addition, increased consumer
sensitivity to real or perceived failures in maintaining acceptable data practices could damage our reputation and deter current and
potential users or customers from using our products and services. The cost of compliance with these laws and regulations will be
high and is likely to increase in the future. The growing patchwork of state and country regulations imposes burdensome obligations
on companies to quickly respond to consumer requests, such as requests to delete, disclose and stop selling personal information,
with significant fines for noncompliance. Complying with these new laws has significantly increased, and may continue to increase,
our operating costs and is driving increased complexity in our operations.
Risks related to government regulations and litigation
Our operations and products are subject to extensive laws, regulations and policies, including those related to vehicle
emissions and fuel economy standards, which can significantly increase our costs and affect how we do business. We are
significantly affected by governmental regulations on a global basis that can increase costs related to the production of our vehicles
and affect our product portfolio, particularly regulations relating to fuel economy standards and GHG emissions. Meeting or
exceeding the requirements of these regulations is costly, often technologically challenging and may require phase-out of internal
combustion propulsion in certain major jurisdictions, and these standards are often not harmonized across jurisdictions. We
anticipate that the number and extent of these and other regulations, laws and policies, and the related costs and changes to our
product portfolio, may increase significantly in the future, primarily motivated by efforts to reduce GHG emissions. Specifically,
fuel economy and GHG emission regulations at the federal, state or local level or in international jurisdictions could require us to
further limit the sale of certain profitable products, subsidize the sale of less profitable ones, change our manufacturing processes,
pay penalties or undertake other activities that may require us to incur additional expense, which may be material. These
requirements may increase the cost of, and/or diminish demand for, our vehicles. These regulatory requirements, among others,
could significantly affect our plans for global product development and, given the uncertainty surrounding enforcement and
regulatory definitions and interpretations, may result in substantial costs, including civil or criminal penalties. In addition, an
evolving but un-harmonized emissions and fuel economy regulatory framework that could include specific sales mandates may limit
or dictate the types of vehicles we sell and where we sell them, which can affect our revenues. Refer to the “Environmental and
Regulatory Matters” section of Item 1. Business for further information on regulatory and environmental requirements.
We expect that to comply with fuel economy and GHG emission standards and mandates to sell specific volumes of ZEV in
certain jurisdictions, we will be required to sell a significant volume of EVs, and potentially develop and implement new
technologies for conventional internal combustion engines, all of which will require substantial investment and expense. There are
limits on our ability to achieve fuel economy improvements over a given time frame, primarily relating to the cost and effectiveness
of available technologies, lack of sufficient consumer acceptance of new technologies and of changes in vehicle mix, lack of
willingness of consumers to absorb the additional costs of new technologies, the appropriateness (or lack thereof) of certain
technologies for use in particular vehicles, the widespread availability (or lack thereof) of supporting infrastructure for new
technologies, especially for EVs, and the human, engineering and financial resources necessary to deploy new technologies across a
wide range of products and powertrains in a short time. There is no assurance that we will be able to produce and sell vehicles that
use such new technologies on a profitable basis or that our customers will purchase such vehicles in the quantities necessary for us to
comply with current or future regulatory requirements.
In the current uncertain regulatory framework, compliance costs for which we may be responsible and that are not reasonably
estimable could be substantial. Alleged violations of fuel economy or emission standards could result in legal proceedings, the recall
of one or more of our products, negotiated remedial actions, fines, restricted product offerings or a combination of any of those
items. Any of these actions could have a material adverse effect on our profitability, financial condition and operations, including
facility idling, reduced employment, increased costs and loss of revenue.

GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES
In addition, many of our advanced technologies, including AVs, present novel issues with which domestic and foreign regulators
have only limited experience, and will be subject to evolving regulatory frameworks. Any current or future regulations in these areas
could impede the successful commercialization of these technologies and impact whether and how these technologies are designed
and integrated into our products, and may ultimately subject us to increased costs and uncertainty.
We could be materially adversely affected by unusual or significant litigation, governmental investigations or other
proceedings. We are subject to legal proceedings in the U.S. and elsewhere involving various issues, including product liability
lawsuits, warranty litigation, class action litigations alleging product defects, emissions litigation, stockholder litigation, labor and
employment litigation and claims and actions arising from restructurings and divestitures of operations and assets. In addition, we
are subject to governmental proceedings and investigations. A negative outcome in one or more of these legal proceedings could
result in the imposition of damages, including punitive damages, fines, reputational harm, civil lawsuits and criminal penalties,
interruptions of business, modification of business practices, equitable remedies and other sanctions against us or our personnel as
well as legal and other costs, all of which may be significant. For a further discussion of these matters refer to Note 16 to our
consolidated financial statements.
The costs and effect on our reputation of product safety recalls and alleged defects in products and services could materially
adversely affect our business. Government safety standards require manufacturers to remedy certain product safety defects through
recall campaigns and vehicle repurchases. Under these standards, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties or may incur
various costs, including significant costs for repairs made at no cost to the consumer. The costs we incur in connection with these
recalls typically include the cost of the part being replaced and labor to remove and replace the defective part. The costs to complete
a recall could be exacerbated to the extent that such action relates to a global platform, such as the Chevrolet Bolt EV recall.
Concerns about the safety of our products, including advanced technologies like AVs, whether raised internally or by regulators or
consumer advocates, and whether or not based on scientific evidence or supported by data, can result in product delays, recalls, field
actions, lost sales, governmental investigations, regulatory action, private claims, lawsuits and settlements and reputational damage.
These circumstances can also result in damage to brand image, brand equity and consumer trust in our products and ability to lead
the disruption occurring in the automotive industry.
We currently source a variety of systems, components, raw materials and parts from third parties. From time to time these items
may have performance or quality issues that could harm our reputation and cause us to incur significant costs, particularly if the
affected items relate to global platforms or involve defects that are identified years after production. Our ability to recover costs
associated with recalls or other campaigns caused by parts or components purchased from suppliers may be limited by the suppliers’
financial condition or a number of other reasons or defenses.
We may incur additional tax expense or become subject to additional tax exposure. We are subject to the tax laws and
regulations of the U.S. and numerous other jurisdictions in which we do business. Many judgments are required in determining our
worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities, and we are regularly under audit by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service
and other tax authorities, which may not agree with our tax positions. In addition, our tax liabilities are subject to other significant
risks and uncertainties, including those arising from potential changes in laws and regulations in the countries in which we do
business, the possibility of adverse determinations with respect to the application of existing laws, changes in our business or
structure and changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities. Any unfavorable resolution of these and other
uncertainties may have a significant adverse impact on our tax rate and results of operations. If our tax expense were to increase, or
if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our operating results, cash
flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.
Risks related to Automotive Financing - GM Financial
We rely on GM Financial to provide financial services to our customers and dealers. GM Financial faces a number of business,
economic and financial risks that could impair its access to capital and negatively affect its business and operations, which in turn
could impede its ability to provide leasing and financing to customers and commercial lending to our dealers. Any reduction in GM
Financial’s ability to provide such financial services would negatively affect our efforts to support additional sales of our vehicles
and expand our market penetration among customers and dealers.
The primary factors that could adversely affect GM Financial’s business and operations and reduce its ability to provide financing
services at competitive rates include the sufficiency, availability and cost of sources of financing, including credit facilities,
securitization programs and secured and unsecured debt issuances; the performance of loans and leases in its portfolio, which could
be materially affected by charge-offs, delinquencies and prepayments; wholesale auction values of used vehicles; vehicle return rates
and the residual value performance on vehicles GM Financial leases to customers; fluctuations in interest rates and currencies;
competition for customers from commercial banks, credit unions and other financing and leasing companies; and changes to
regulation, supervision, enforcement and licensing across various jurisdictions.

In addition, GM Financial has certain floating-rate obligations, hedging transactions and floating-rate dealer loans that determine
their applicable interest rate or payment amount by reference to the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). The U.K. Financial
Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, has announced that it will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the
calculation of LIBOR after 2021. In March 2021, the ICE Benchmark Administration Limited, the administrator of LIBOR,
extended the transition dates of certain LIBOR tenors (including all U.S. Dollar LIBOR tenors other than one-week and two-month
U.S. Dollar LIBOR tenors) to June 30, 2023, after which LIBOR reference rates will cease to be provided. Despite this deferral, the
LIBOR administrator has advised that no new contracts using U.S. Dollar LIBOR should be entered into after December 31, 2021. It
is unknown whether any banks will continue to voluntarily submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR, or whether LIBOR will
continue to be published by its administrator based on these submissions or on any other basis, after such dates. At this time, it is not
possible to predict the effect that these developments or any discontinuance, modification or other reforms may have on LIBOR,
other benchmarks or floating-rate debt instruments, including GM Financial’s floating-rate debt. Any such discontinuance,
modification, alternative reference rates or other reforms may materially adversely affect interest rates on GM Financial’s current
indebtedness. There is a risk that the discontinuation of LIBOR will impact GM Financial's ability to manage interest rate risk
effectively without an adequate replacement.
Further, as an entity operating in the financial services sector, GM Financial is required to comply with a wide variety of laws and
regulations that may be costly to adhere to and may affect our consolidated operating results. Compliance with these laws and
regulations requires that GM Financial maintain forms, processes, procedures, controls and the infrastructure to support these
requirements, and these laws and regulations often create operational constraints both on GM Financial’s ability to implement
servicing procedures and on pricing. Laws in the financial services industry are designed primarily for the protection of consumers.
The failure to comply with these laws could result in significant statutory civil and criminal penalties, monetary damages, attorneys’
fees and costs, possible revocation of licenses and damage to reputation, brand and valued customer relationships.
Risks related to defined benefit pension plans
Our defined benefit pension plans are currently underfunded and our pension funding requirements could increase
significantly due to a reduction in funded status as a result of a variety of factors, including weak performance of financial
markets, declining interest rates, changes in laws or regulations, or changes in assumptions or investments that do not achieve
adequate returns. Our employee benefit plans currently hold a significant amount of equity and fixed income securities. A detailed
description of the investment funds and strategies and our potential funding requirements are disclosed in Note 15 to our
consolidated financial statements, which also describes significant concentrations of risk to the plan investments.
Our future funding requirements for our defined benefit pension plans depend upon the future performance of assets placed in
trusts for these plans, the level of interest rates used to determine funding levels, the level of benefits provided for by the plans and
any changes in laws and regulations. Future funding requirements generally increase if the discount rate decreases or if actual asset
returns are lower than expected asset returns, assuming other factors are held constant. We estimate future contributions to these
plans using assumptions with respect to these and other items. Changes to those assumptions could have a significant effect on
future contributions.
There are additional risks due to the complexity and magnitude of our investments. Examples include implementation of
significant changes in investment policy, insufficient market liquidity in particular asset classes and the inability to quickly rebalance
illiquid and long-term investments.
Factors that affect future funding requirements for our U.S. defined benefit plans generally affect the required funding for non-
U.S. plans. Certain plans outside the U.S. do not have assets and therefore the obligation is funded as benefits are paid. If local legal
authorities increase the minimum funding requirements for our non-U.S. plans, we could be required to contribute more funds,
which could negatively affect our liquidity and financial condition.

actual results to differ materially from those projected. Refer to the "Forward-Looking Statements" section of this MD&A and Part I,
Item 1A. Risk Factors for a discussion of these risks and uncertainties. The discussion of our financial condition and results of
operations for the year ended December 31, 2019 included in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 is incorporated by reference
into this MD&A.
Non-GAAP Measures Our non-GAAP measures include: earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT)-adjusted, presented net of
noncontrolling interests; earnings before income taxes (EBT)-adjusted for our GM Financial segment; earnings per share (EPS)-
diluted-adjusted; effective tax rate-adjusted (ETR-adjusted); return on invested capital-adjusted (ROIC-adjusted) and adjusted
automotive free cash flow. Our calculation of these non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other
companies due to potential differences between companies in the method of calculation. As a result, the use of these non-GAAP
measures has limitations and should not be considered superior to, in isolation from, or as a substitute for, related U.S. GAAP
measures.
These non-GAAP measures allow management and investors to view operating trends, perform analytical comparisons and
benchmark performance between periods and among geographic regions to understand operating performance without regard to
items we do not consider a component of our core operating performance. Furthermore, these non-GAAP measures allow investors
the opportunity to measure and monitor our performance against our externally communicated targets and evaluate the investment
decisions being made by management to improve ROIC-adjusted. Management uses these measures in its financial, investment and
operational decision-making processes, for internal reporting and as part of its forecasting and budgeting processes. Further, our
Board of Directors uses certain of these and other measures as key metrics to determine management performance under our
performance-based compensation plans. For these reasons, we believe these non-GAAP measures are useful for our investors.
EBIT-adjusted EBIT-adjusted is presented net of noncontrolling interests and is used by management and can be used by investors
to review our consolidated operating results because it excludes automotive interest income, automotive interest expense and income
taxes as well as certain additional adjustments that are not considered part of our core operations.
25
Table of Contents
GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES
Examples of adjustments to EBIT include, but are not limited to, impairment charges on long-lived assets and other exit costs
resulting from strategic shifts in our operations or discrete market and business conditions; costs arising from the ignition switch
recall and related legal matters; and certain currency devaluations associated with hyperinflationary economies. For EBIT-adjusted
and our other non-GAAP measures, once we have made an adjustment in the current period for an item, we will also adjust the
related non-GAAP measure in any future periods in which there is an impact from the item. Our corresponding measure for our GM
Financial segment is EBT-adjusted because interest income and interest expense are part of operating results when assessing and
measuring the operational and financial performance of the segment.
EPS-diluted-adjusted EPS-diluted-adjusted is used by management and can be used by investors to review our consolidated
diluted EPS results on a consistent basis. EPS-diluted-adjusted is calculated as net income attributable to common stockholders-
diluted less adjustments noted above for EBIT-adjusted and certain income tax adjustments divided by weighted-average common
shares outstanding-diluted. Examples of income tax adjustments include the establishment or reversal of significant deferred tax
asset valuation allowances.
ETR-adjusted ETR-adjusted is used by management and can be used by investors to review the consolidated effective tax rate for
our core operations on a consistent basis. ETR-adjusted is calculated as Income tax expense less the income tax related to the
adjustments noted above for EBIT-adjusted and the income tax adjustments noted above for EPS-diluted-adjusted divided by Income
before income taxes less adjustments. When we provide an expected adjusted effective tax rate, we do not provide an expected
effective tax rate because the U.S. GAAP measure may include significant adjustments that are difficult to predict.
ROIC-adjusted ROIC-adjusted is used by management and can be used by investors to review our investment and capital
allocation decisions. We define ROIC-adjusted as EBIT-adjusted for the trailing four quarters divided by ROIC-adjusted average net
assets, which is considered to be the average equity balances adjusted for average automotive debt and interest liabilities, exclusive
of finance leases; average automotive net pension and other postretirement benefits (OPEB) liabilities; and average automotive net
income tax assets during the same period.
Adjusted automotive free cash flow Adjusted automotive free cash flow is used by management and can be used by investors to
review the liquidity of our automotive operations and to measure and monitor our performance against our capital allocation
program and evaluate our automotive liquidity against the substantial cash requirements of our automotive operations. We measure
adjusted automotive free cash flow as automotive operating cash flow from operations less capital expenditures adjusted for
management actions. Management actions can include voluntary events such as discretionary contributions to employee benefit
plans or nonrecurring specific events such as a closure of a facility that are considered special for EBIT-adjusted purposes. Refer to
the “Liquidity and Capital Resources” section of this MD&A for additional information.

Overview Our vision for the future is a world with zero crashes, zero emissions and zero congestion, which guides our growth-
focused strategy to invest in EVs and AVs, software-enabled services and subscriptions and new business opportunities, while
strengthening our market position in profitable ICE vehicles, such as trucks and SUVs. We will execute our strategy with a diverse
team and a steadfast commitment to good citizenship through sustainable operations and a leading health and safety culture.
The automotive industry and GM are currently experiencing a global semiconductor supply shortage. The supply shortage has
impacted, and continues to impact, multiple suppliers that incorporate semiconductors into the parts they supply to us. We expect the
availability of semiconductors to improve throughout 2022. We will continue prioritizing our most popular and in-demand vehicles,
including our full-size trucks, full-size SUVs, and EVs. We do not expect this shortage to impact our long-term growth and EV
initiatives. In June 2021, we announced plans to increase our investment in EVs and AVs to more than $35.0 billion from 2020
through 2025, in part to accelerate battery and EV assembly capacity.
We also continue to monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and government actions and measures taken to prevent its
spread, and the potential to affect our operations. Refer to Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion of these risks.
For the year ending December 31, 2022, we expect EPS-diluted and EPS-diluted-adjusted of between $6.25 and $7.25, Net
income attributable to stockholders of between $9.4 billion and $10.8 billion and EBIT-adjusted of between $13.0 billion and $15.0
billion. We do not consider the potential impact of future adjustments on our expected financial results.
The following table reconciles expected Net income attributable to stockholders under U.S. GAAP to expected EBIT-adjusted

________
(a) We do not consider the potential future impact of adjustments on our expected financial results.
We also face continuing market, operating and regulatory challenges in several countries across the globe due to, among other
factors, weak economic conditions, competitive pressures, limitations in our product portfolio offerings, heightened emission
standards, labor disruptions, foreign exchange volatility, rising material and services prices driven by inflationary pressures,
evolving trade policy and political uncertainty. Refer to Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors for a discussion of these challenges.

As we continue to assess our performance and the needs of our evolving business, additional restructuring and rationalization
actions could be required. These actions could give rise to future asset impairments or other charges, which may have a material
impact on our operating results.
GMNA Industry sales in North America were 18.5 million units in the year ended December 31, 2021, representing an increase of
4.3% compared to the corresponding period in 2020. U.S. industry sales were 15.4 million units in the year ended December 31,
2021, representing an increase of 3.3% compared to the corresponding period in 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic originally resulted
in a contraction of total North America industry volumes in 2020 that continued into 2021. Dealer inventory remains constrained for
several critical vehicles, including our full-size trucks and full-size SUVs.
Our total vehicle sales in the U.S., our largest market in North America, were 2.2 million units for a market share of 14.4% in the
year ended December 31, 2021, representing a decrease of 2.7 percentage points compared to the corresponding period in 2020.
We expect to sustain relatively strong EBIT-adjusted margins in 2022 on the continued strength of favorable vehicle pricing and
strong U.S. industry light vehicle demand, partially offset by higher costs associated with commodities, raw materials and logistics.
Our outlook is dependent on the pricing environment, continuing improvement of the semiconductor supply shortage and overall
economic conditions. As a result of the semiconductor supply shortage, we experienced interruptions to our planned production
schedules and temporarily suspended certain manufacturing sites to prioritize production of our most popular and in-demand
products, including our full-size trucks and full-size SUVs. Additionally, we have been manufacturing vehicles, without the
impacted components, representing an inventory carrying value of approximately $0.6 billion at December 31, 2021. We expect to
hold these vehicles in our inventory until they are completed and sold to our dealers, which we expect to happen in the six months
ending June 30, 2022.
GMI Industry sales in China were 25.9 million units in the year ended December 31, 2021, representing an increase of 3.8%
compared to the corresponding period in 2020, which was adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Our total vehicle sales
in China were 2.9 million units resulting in a market share of 11.2% in the year ended December 31, 2021, representing a decrease
of 0.5 percentage points compared to the corresponding period in 2020. The ongoing global semiconductor supply shortage, macro-
economic impact of COVID-19 and geopolitical tensions continue to place pressure on China's automotive industry and our vehicle
sales in China. Our Automotive China JVs generated equity income of $1.1 billion in the year ended December 31, 2021. Although
price competition, higher costs associated with commodities and raw materials, and a more challenging regulatory environment
related to emissions, fuel consumption and NEV requirements will place pressure on our operations in China, we will continue to
build upon our strong brands, network, and partnerships in China as well as drive improvements in vehicle mix and cost.
Outside of China, industry sales were 23.0 million units in the year ended December 31, 2021, representing an increase of 8.2%
compared to the corresponding period in 2020. Our total vehicle sales outside of China were 0.8 million units for a market share of
3.6% in the year ended December 31, 2021, representing a decrease of 1.1 percentage points compared to the corresponding period
in 2020.
Cruise Cruise is actively testing AVs in the United States. Gated by safety and regulation, the goal of Cruise is to deliver its self-
driving services as soon as possible.
In the year ended December 31, 2021, Cruise Holdings issued Class G Preferred Shares (Cruise Class G Preferred Shares) in
exchange for $2.7 billion from Microsoft Corporation (Microsoft), Walmart Inc. (Walmart) and other investors, including
$1.0 billion from General Motors Holdings LLC. All proceeds related to the Cruise Class G Preferred Shares are designated
exclusively for working capital and general corporate purposes of Cruise Holdings. In addition, Cruise Holdings and Microsoft
entered into a long-term strategic relationship to accelerate the commercialization of self-driving vehicles. Refer to Note 20 to our
consolidated financial statements for further details.
Automotive Financing - GM Financial Summary and Outlook We believe that offering a comprehensive suite of financing
products will generate incremental sales of our vehicles, drive incremental GM Financial earnings and help support our sales
throughout various economic cycles. GM Financial's leasing program is exposed to residual values, which are heavily dependent on
used vehicle prices. Used vehicle prices were higher in 2021 compared to 2020 levels, primarily due to low new vehicle inventory.
In 2022, we expect used vehicle prices may decrease relative to 2021 levels, but to remain above pre-pandemic levels, primarily due
to sustained low new vehicle inventory. The increase in used vehicle prices resulted in gains on terminations of leased vehicles of
$2.0 billion in GM Financial interest, operating and other expenses for the year ended

GM Financial's penetration of our retail sales in the U.S. was 44% in the year ended December 31, 2021 and 45% in the
corresponding period in 2020. Penetration levels vary depending on incentive financing programs available and competing third-
party financing products in the market. GM Financial's prime loan originations as a percentage of total loan originations in North
America was 73% in the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. In the year ended December 31, 2021, GM Financial's revenue
consisted of leased vehicle income of 67%, retail finance charge income of 29% and commercial finance charge income of 2%.
Consolidated Results We review changes in our results of operations under five categories: volume, mix, price, cost and other.
Volume measures the impact of changes in wholesale vehicle volumes driven by industry volume, market share and changes in
dealer stock levels. Mix measures the impact of changes to the regional portfolio due to product, model, trim, country and option
penetration in current year wholesale vehicle volumes. Price measures the impact of changes related to Manufacturer’s Suggested
Retail Price and various sales allowances. Cost primarily includes: (1) material and freight; (2) manufacturing, engineering,
advertising, administrative and selling and warranty expense; and (3) non-vehicle related activity. Other primarily includes foreign
exchange and non-vehicle related automotive revenues as well as equity income or loss from our nonconsolidated affiliates. Refer to
the regional sections of this MD&A for additional information.

The most significant element of our Automotive and other cost of sales is material cost, which makes up approximately two-thirds
of the total amount. The remaining portion includes labor costs, depreciation and amortization, engineering, freight and product
warranty and recall campaigns.
Factors that most significantly influence a region's profitability are industry volume, market share, and the relative mix of vehicles
(trucks, crossovers, cars) sold. Variable profit is a key indicator of product profitability. Variable profit is defined as revenue less
material cost, freight, the variable component of manufacturing expense and warranty and recall-related costs. Vehicles with higher
selling prices generally have higher variable profit. Refer to the regional sections of this MD&A for additional information on
volume and mix.
In the year ended December 31, 2021, unfavorable Cost was primarily due to: (1) increased material and freight costs of $4.0
billion; (2) increased engineering costs of $2.0 billion primarily related to accelerating our electric vehicle portfolio and the non-
recurrence of austerity measures implemented in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic; (3) increased manufacturing costs of $1.4
billion primarily related to the suspension of production and the non-recurrence of austerity measures implemented in 2020 due to
the COVID-19 pandemic; (4) increased costs of $1.1 billion primarily related to parts and accessories; (5) increased other employee
related costs of $0.7 billion; (6) charges of $0.3 billion related to potential royalties accrued with respect to past sales; partially offset
by (7) charges of $0.7 billion primarily related to dealer restructuring charges, property and intangible asset impairments, inventory
provisions and employee separation charges in Australia, New Zealand, Thailand and India in 2020; and (8) a decrease in campaign
and other warranty-related costs of $0.2 billion, which includes Chevrolet Bolt recall costs of $2.0 billion and associated recoveries
of $1.9 billion. In the year ended December 31, 2021, unfavorable Other was due to the foreign currency effect resulting from the
strengthening of the Canadian Dollar and other currencies against the U.S. Dollar, partially offset by the weakening of the Brazilian
Real and other currencies against the U.S. Dollar.

GMNA Total Net Sales and Revenue In the year ended December 31, 2021, Total net sales and revenue increased primarily due
to: (1) favorable mix associated with decreased sales of crossover vehicles and passenger cars and increased sales of full-size SUVs
and full-size pickup trucks, as a result of prioritizing semiconductor chips for our most popular and in-demand vehicles; (2)
favorable price primarily due to lower incentives as a result of low dealer inventory levels and the launch of our full-size SUVs; and
(3) favorable Other due to increased sales of parts and accessories and the foreign currency effect resulting from the strengthening of
the Canadian Dollar and the Mexican Peso against the U.S. Dollar; partially offset by (4) decreased net wholesale volumes due to a
decrease in sales of crossover vehicles and passenger cars, partially offset by increased sales of full-size SUVs and full-size pickup
trucks. The impact on production in 2021 due to the ongoing semiconductor supply shortage exceeded the impact of production
suspensions in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
GMNA EBIT-Adjusted The most significant factors that influence profitability are industry volume and market share. While not
as significant as industry volume and market share, another factor affecting profitability is the relative mix of vehicles sold. Trucks,
crossovers and cars sold currently have a variable profit of approximately 140%, 40% and 40% of our GMNA portfolio on a
weighted-average basis.
In the year ended December 31, 2021, EBIT-adjusted increased primarily due to: (1) favorable mix; (2) favorable price; and (3)

GMI Total Net Sales and Revenue In the year ended December 31, 2021, Total net sales and revenue increased primarily due to:
(1) favorable mix in South America, Asia/Pacific and the Middle East; (2) favorable pricing across multiple vehicle lines in South
America; and (3) favorable Other primarily due to increased components, parts and accessories sales, partially offset by the foreign

We view the Chinese market as important to our global growth strategy and are employing a multi-brand strategy. In the coming
years we plan to leverage our global architectures to increase the number of product offerings under the Buick, Chevrolet and
Cadillac brands in China and continue to grow our business under the local Baojun and Wuling brands. We operate in the Chinese
market through a number of joint ventures and maintaining strong relationships with our joint venture partners is an important part
of our China growth strategy.

GM Financial Revenue In the year ended December 31, 2021, Total revenue decreased primarily due to decreased leased vehicle
income of $0.5 billion, primarily due to a decrease in the size of the leased vehicles portfolio; partially offset by increased finance
charge income of $0.1 billion, primarily due to growth in the retail finance receivables portfolio, partially offset by a decrease in the
effective yield and a decrease in the size of the commercial finance receivables portfolio.
GM Financial EBT-Adjusted In the year ended December 31, 2021, EBT-adjusted increased primarily due to: (1) increased
leased vehicle income net of leased vehicle expenses of $1.2 billion primarily due to decreased depreciation on leased vehicles
resulting from increased residual value estimates and a decrease in the size of the portfolio, as well as increased lease termination
gains; (2) decreased provision for loan losses of $0.6 billion primarily due to a reduction in the reserve levels established at the onset
of the COVID-19 pandemic as a result of actual credit performance that was better than forecasted and favorable expectations for
future charge-offs and recoveries, reflecting improved economic conditions, partially offset by reserves established for loans
originated during the year ended December 31, 2021; (3) decreased interest expense of $0.5 billion due to decreased credit spreads
on GM Financial debt, partially offset by an increase in the average debt outstanding; partially offset by (4) increased operating
expenses of $0.2 billion in 2021. GM Financial interest, operating and other expenses includes a $0.1 billion loss on extinguishment
of debt.
Liquidity and Capital Resources We believe our current levels of cash, cash equivalents, marketable debt securities, available
borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facilities and other liquidity actions currently available to us are sufficient to meet our
liquidity requirements. We also maintain access to the capital markets and may issue debt or equity securities, which may provide an
additional source of liquidity. We have substantial cash requirements going forward, which we plan to fund through our total
available liquidity, cash flows from operating activities and additional liquidity measures, if determined to be necessary.

(a) Amounts include automotive interest payments based on contractual terms and current interest rates on our debt and finance lease obligations.
Automotive interest payments based on variable interest rates were determined using the interest rate in ef fect at December 31, 2021.
(b) GM Financial interest payments were determined using the interest rate in effect at December 31, 2021 for floating rate debt and the
contractual rates for fixed  rate debt. GM Financial interest payments on floating rate tranches of the securitization notes payable were
converted to a fixed rate based on the floating rate plus any expected hedge payments.
(c) Primarily consists of information technology and other contractual services.
Our known current material uses of cash include, among other possible demands: (1) capital spending and our investments in
Ultium Cells LLC, our battery joint venture, of approximately $9.0 billion to $10.0 billion annually over the medium term in
addition to payments for engineering and product development activities; (2) payments associated with previously announced
vehicle recalls and any other recall-related contingencies; and (3) payments to service debt and other long-term obligations,
including discretionary and mandatory contributions to our pension plans. Our material future uses of cash, which may vary from
time to time based on market conditions and other factors, are focused on the three objectives of our capital allocation program: (1)
grow our business at an average target ROIC-adjusted rate of 20% or greater; (2) maintain a strong investment-grade balance sheet,
including a target average automotive cash balance of $18 billion; and (3) after the first two objectives are met, return available cash
to shareholders. Our senior management evaluates our capital allocation program on an ongoing basis and recommends any
modifications to the program to our Board of Directors, not less than once annually.
Our liquidity plans are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those described in the "Forward-Looking
Statements" section of this MD&A and Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors, some of which are outside of our control.
We continue to monitor and evaluate opportunities to strengthen our competitive position over the long term while maintaining a
strong investment-grade balance sheet. These actions may include opportunistic payments to reduce our long-term obligations, as
well as the possibility of acquisitions, dispositions and investments with joint venture partners as well as strategic alliances that we
believe would generate significant advantages and substantially strengthen our business.
In January 2017, we announced that our Board of Directors had authorized the purchase of up to $5.0 billion of our common stock
with no expiration date, as part of our common stock repurchase program. We have completed $1.7 billion of the $5.0 billion
program through December 31, 2021.
Cash flows that occur amongst our Automotive, Cruise and GM Financial operations are eliminated when we consolidate our cash
flows. Such eliminations include, among other things, collections by Automotive on wholesale accounts receivables financed by
dealers through GM Financial, payments between Automotive and GM Financial for accounts receivables transferred by Automotive
to GM Financial, loans to Automotive from GM Financial, dividends issued by GM Financial to Automotive, tax payments by GM
Financial to Automotive and Automotive cash injections in Cruise. The presentation of Automotive liquidity, Cruise liquidity and
GM Financial liquidity presented below includes the impact of cash transactions amongst the sectors that are ultimately eliminated
in consolidation.
Automotive Liquidity Total available liquidity includes cash, cash equivalents, marketable debt securities and funds available
under credit facilities. The amount of available liquidity is subject to seasonal fluctuations and includes balances held by various
business units and subsidiaries worldwide that are needed to fund their operations.

GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES
We manage our liquidity primarily at our treasury centers as well as at certain of our significant consolidated overseas
subsidiaries. Over 90% of our cash and marketable debt securities were managed within North America and at our regional treasury
centers at December 31, 2021. We have used and will continue to use other methods including intercompany loans to utilize these
funds across our global operations as needed.
Our cash equivalents and marketable debt securities balances are primarily denominated in U.S. Dollars and include investments
in U.S. government and agency obligations, foreign government securities, time deposits, corporate debt securities and mortgage and
asset-backed securities. Our investment guidelines, which we may change from time to time, prescribe certain minimum credit
worthiness thresholds and limit our exposures to any particular sector, asset class, issuance or security type. The majority of our
current investments in debt securities are with A/A2 or better rated issuers.
We use credit facilities as a mechanism to provide additional flexibility in managing our global liquidity. At December 31, 2020,
the total size of our credit facilities was $18.5 billion, which consisted principally of four revolving credit facilities. In April 2021,
we increased the total borrowing capacity of our five-year, $10.5 billion facility to $11.2 billion and extended the termination date
for a $9.9 billion portion of the five-year facility by three years, now set to mature on April 18, 2026. The termination date of April
18, 2023 for the remaining portion of the five-year facility remains unchanged. We also renewed and increased the total borrowing
capacity of our three-year, $4.0 billion facility to $4.3 billion, which now matures on April 7, 2024, and renewed our 364-day, $2.0
billion facility allocated for exclusive use by GM Financial, which now matures on April 6, 2022. We also terminated a separate
364-day, $2.0 billion revolving credit facility, entered into in May 2020. Additionally, the prior restrictions on share repurchases and
dividends on our common shares were removed upon entrance into the renewed three-year, $4.3 billion facility. In December 2021,
we terminated our three-year, $2.0 billion transformation credit facility. At December 31, 2021, the total size of our credit facilities
was $15.5 billion, which consisted primarily of two credit facilities.
If available capacity permits, GM Financial has access to our revolving credit facilities. GM Financial did not have borrowings
outstanding against our revolving credit facilities at December 31, 2021 or 2020. Refer to Note 13 to our consolidated financial
statements for additional information on credit facilities. We had intercompany loans from GM Financial of $0.2 billion and $0.4
billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, which primarily consisted of commercial loans to dealers we consolidate, and we had no
intercompany loans to GM Financial. Refer to Note 5 of our consolidated financial statements for additional information.
Several of our loan facilities, including our revolving credit facilities, require compliance with certain financial and operational
covenants as well as regular reporting to lenders. We have reviewed our covenants in effect as of December 31, 2021 and determined
we are in compliance and expect to remain in compliance in the future.
GM Financial's Board of Directors declared and paid dividends of $3.5 billion, $0.8 billion, and $0.4 billion on its common stock
in 2021, 2020, and 2019. Current dividend levels are reflective of GM Financial earnings supported by strong residual values,
favorable credit performance and improved economic conditions. Future dividends from GM Financial will depend on several
factors including business and economic conditions, its financial condition, earnings, liquidity requirements and leverage ratio.

Automotive Financing – GM Financial Liquidity GM Financial's primary sources of cash are finance charge income, leasing
income and proceeds from the sale of terminated leased vehicles, net distributions from credit facilities, securitizations, secured and
unsecured borrowings and collections and recoveries on finance receivables. GM Financial's primary uses of cash are purchases and
funding of finance receivables and leased vehicles, repayment or repurchases of secured and unsecured debt, funding credit
enhancement requirements in connection with securitizations and secured credit facilities, interest costs, operating expenses, income
taxes and dividend payments. GM Financial continues to monitor and evaluate opportunities to optimize its liquidity position and the
mix of its debt between secured and unsecured debt. The following table summarizes GM Financial's available liquidity (dollars in
billions):

Total GM Financial available liquidity $ 25.7 $ 26.6 
In the year ended December 31, 2021, GM Financial's available liquidity decreased primarily due to a decrease in cash and cash
equivalents, partially offset by increased available borrowing capacity on unpledged eligible assets, resulting from the issuance of
securitization transactions and unsecured debt. GM Financial structures liquidity to support at least six months of GM Financial's
expected net cash flows, including new originations, without access to new debt financing transactions or other capital markets
activity.
GM Financial has access to $15.5 billion of our revolving credit facilities with exclusive access to the 364-day, $2.0 billion
facility. Refer to the "Automotive Liquidity" section of this MD&A for additional details. We have a support agreement with GM
Financial which, among other things, establishes commitments of funding from us to GM Financial. This agreement also provides
that we will continue to own all of GM Financial’s outstanding voting shares so long as any unsecured debt securities

remain outstanding at GM Financial. In addition, we are required to use our commercially reasonable efforts to ensure GM Financial
remains a subsidiary borrower under our corporate revolving credit facilities.
Credit Facilities In the normal course of business, in addition to using its available cash, GM Financial utilizes borrowings under
its credit facilities, which may be secured or unsecured, and GM Financial repays these borrowings as appropriate under its cash
management strategy. At December 31, 2021, secured, committed unsecured and uncommitted unsecured credit facilities totaled
$26.2 billion, $0.5 billion and $1.2 billion with advances outstanding of $3.5 billion, an insignificant amount and $1.2 billion.

LIBOR Transition As discussed in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors, banks will no longer be persuaded or compelled to submit rates
for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. GM Financial established a LIBOR transition initiative in 2019 to evaluate the potential
impacts of the transition, and continues to implement strategies to mitigate the risks associated with the LIBOR discontinuation such
as including fallback language into any new LIBOR based contracts. GM Financial has only a limited amount of debt outstanding
that is scheduled to mature after June 30, 2023 and would utilize the Alternative Reference Rates Committee fallback process.
Furthermore, GM Financial has adhered to the International Swaps and Derivatives Association’s Fallbacks Protocol and plans to
transition its existing LIBOR-based derivative exposure in advance of the June 30, 2023 date when applicable LIBOR will no longer
be published. For any residual exposure after the end of 2021, GM Financial expects to leverage relevant contractual and statutory
solutions to transition such exposure.
Critical Accounting Estimates The consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which requires
the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses in the
periods presented. We believe the accounting estimates employed are appropriate and the resulting balances are reasonable;
however, due to the inherent uncertainties in developing estimates, actual results could differ from the original estimates, requiring
adjustments to these balances in future periods. Refer to Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for our significant
accounting policies related to our critical accounting estimates.
Product Warranty and Recall Campaigns The estimates related to product warranties are established using historical information
on the nature, frequency and average cost of claims of each vehicle line or each model year of the vehicle line and assumptions
about future activity and events. When little or no claims experience exists for a model year or a vehicle line, the estimate is based
on comparable models.
We accrue the costs related to product warranty at the time of vehicle sale and we accrue the estimated cost of recall campaigns
when they are probable and estimable.
41
Table of Contents
GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES
The estimates related to recall campaigns accrued at the time of vehicle sale are established by applying a paid loss approach that
considers the number of historical recall campaigns and the estimated cost for each recall campaign. These estimates consider the
nature, frequency and magnitude of historical recall campaigns, and use key assumptions including the number of historical periods
and the weighting of historical data in the reserve studies. Costs associated with recall campaigns not accrued at the time of vehicle
sale are estimated based on the estimated cost of repairs and the estimated vehicles to be repaired. Depending on part availability and
time to complete repairs we may, from time to time, offer courtesy transportation at no cost to our customers. These estimates are re-
evaluated on an ongoing basis and based on the best available information. Revisions are made when necessary based on changes in
these factors.
The estimated amount accrued for recall campaigns at the time of vehicle sale is most sensitive to the estimated number of recall
events, the number of vehicles per recall event, the assumed number of vehicles that will be brought in by customers for repair (take
rate) and the cost per vehicle for each recall event. The estimated cost of a recall campaign that is accrued on an individual basis is
most sensitive to our estimated assumed take rate that is primarily developed based on our historical take rate experience. A 10%
increase in the estimated take rate for all recall campaigns would increase the estimated cost by approximately $0.6 billion.
Actual experience could differ from the amounts estimated requiring adjustments to these liabilities in future periods. Due to the
uncertainty and potential volatility of the factors contributing to developing estimates, changes in our assumptions could materially
affect our results of operations.
Sales Incentives The estimated effect of sales incentives offered to dealers and end customers is recorded as a reduction of
Automotive net sales and revenue at the time of sale. There may be numerous types of incentives available at any particular time.
Incentive programs are generally specific to brand, model or sales region and are for specified time periods, which may be extended.
Significant factors used in estimating the cost of incentives include type of program, forecasted sales volume, product mix, and the
rate of customer acceptance of incentive programs, all of which are estimated based on historical experience and assumptions
concerning future customer behavior and market conditions. A change in any of these factors affecting the estimate could have a
significant effect on recorded sales incentives. A 10% increase in the cost of incentives would increase the sales incentive liability by
an insignificant amount. Subsequent adjustments to incentive estimates are possible as facts and circumstances change over time,
which could affect the revenue previously recognized in Automotive net sales and revenue.
GM Financial Allowance for Loan Losses The GM Financial retail finance receivables portfolio consists of smaller-balance,
homogeneous loans that are carried at amortized cost, net of allowance for loan losses. The allowance for loan losses on retail
finance receivables reflects net credit losses expected to be incurred over the remaining life of the retail finance receivables, which
have a weighted average remaining life of approximately two years. GM Financial forecasts net credit losses based on relevant
information about past events, current conditions and forecast economic performance. GM Financial believes that the allowance is
adequate to cover expected credit losses on the retail finance receivables; however, because the allowance for loan losses is based on
estimates, there can be no assurance that the ultimate charge-off amount will not exceed such estimates or that our credit loss
assumptions will not increase.
GM Financial incorporates its outlook on forecast charge-off recovery rates and overall economic performance in its allowance
estimate. Due to the high used vehicle prices in 2021, GM Financial increased its recovery rate forecast as of December 31, 2021.
Each 5% relative decrease/increase in the forecast recovery rates would increase/decrease the allowance for loan losses by
approximately $0.1 billion.
At December 31, 2021, the weightings applied to the economic forecast scenarios considered resulted in an allowance for loan
losses on the retail finance receivables portfolio of $1.8 billion. Using different possible weightings that GM Financial could apply
to the economic forecast scenarios result in an allowance for loan losses ranging from $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion. Actual economic
data and recovery rates that are lower than those forecasted by GM Financial could result in an increase to the allowance for loan
losses.
The GM Financial commercial finance receivables portfolio consists of floorplan financing as well as dealer loans, which are
loans to finance improvements to dealership facilities, to provide working capital, or to purchase and/or finance dealership real
estate. The allowance for loan losses on commercial finance receivables is based on historical loss experience for the consolidated
portfolio, in addition to forecasted industry vehicle sales. There can be no assurance that the ultimate charge-off amount will not
exceed such estimates or that GM Financial's credit loss assumptions will not increase.

GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES
Valuation of GM Financial Equipment on Operating Lease Assets and Residuals GM Financial has investments in leased
vehicles recorded as operating leases. Each leased asset in the portfolio represents a vehicle that GM Financial owns and has leased
to a customer. At lease inception, an estimate is made of the expected residual value for the vehicle at the end of the lease term,
which typically ranges from two to five years. GM Financial estimates the expected residual value based on third-party data that
considers various data points and assumptions, including, but not limited to, recent auction values, the expected future volume of
returning leased vehicles, significant liquidation of rental or fleet inventory, used vehicle prices, manufacturer incentive programs
and fuel prices. Realization of the residual values is dependent on the future ability to market the vehicles under prevailing market
conditions.
The customer is obligated to make payments during the lease term for the difference between the purchase price and the contract
residual value plus a money factor. However, since the customer is not obligated to purchase the vehicle at the end of the contract,
GM Financial is exposed to a risk of loss to the extent the customer returns the vehicle prior to or at the end of the lease term and the
value of the vehicle is lower than the residual value estimated at lease inception.
At December 31, 2021, the estimated residual value of GM Financial's leased vehicles was $29.1 billion. Depreciation reduces the
carrying value of each leased asset in GM Financial's operating lease portfolio over time from its original acquisition value to its
expected residual value at the end of the lease term. In 2021, prices on leased vehicles at termination generally exceeded their
contractual residual values due to high used vehicle prices. Accordingly, GM Financial increased the residual value estimates at
December 31, 2021, which will result in a prospective decrease in the depreciation rate over the remaining term of the leased
vehicles portfolio. If used vehicle prices weaken compared to estimates, GM Financial would increase depreciation expense and/or
record an impairment charge on the lease portfolio. If an impairment exists, GM Financial would determine any shortfall in
recoverability of the leased vehicle asset groups by year, make and model. Recoverability is calculated as the excess of: (1) the sum
of remaining lease payments plus estimated residual value; over (2) leased vehicles, net less deferred revenue. Alternatively, if used
vehicle prices outperform GM Financial's latest estimates, it may record gains on sales of off-lease vehicles and/or decreased
depreciation expense.
The following table illustrates the effect of a 1% relative change in the estimated residual values at December 31, 2021, which
could increase or decrease depreciation expense over the remaining term of the leased vehicle portfolio, holding all other
assumptions constant (dollars in millions):
Impact to Depreciation
Expense
2022 $ 207 
2023 67 
2024 16 
2025 and thereafter 1 
Total $ 291 
Changes to residual values are rarely simultaneous across all maturities and segments, and also may impact return rates. If a
decrease in residual values is concentrated among specific asset groups, the decrease could result in an immediate impairment
charge. GM Financial reviewed the leased vehicle portfolio for indicators of impairment and determined that no impairment
indicators were present at December 31, 2021 and 2020.
Used vehicle prices were higher in 2021 compared to 2020 levels, primarily due to low new vehicle inventory. In 2022, GM
Financial expects used vehicle prices may decrease relative to 2021 levels, but to remain above pre-pandemic levels, primarily due
to sustained low new vehicle inventory.
Pension and OPEB Plans Our defined benefit pension plans are accounted for on an actuarial basis, which requires the selection
of various assumptions, including an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, a discount rate, mortality rates of participants
and expectation of mortality improvement. Our pension obligations include Korean statutory pension payments that are valued on a
walk away basis. The expected long-term rate of return on U.S. plan assets that is utilized in determining pension expense is derived
from periodic studies, which include a review of asset allocation strategies, anticipated future long-term performance of individual
asset classes, risks using standard deviations and correlations of returns among the asset classes that comprise the plans' asset mix.
While the studies give appropriate consideration to recent plan performance and historical returns, the assumptions are primarily
long-term, prospective rates of return.

GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES
In December 2021, an investment policy study was completed for the U.S. pension plans. As a result of changes to our capital
market assumptions, the weighted-average long-term rate of return on assets decreased from 5.6% at December 31, 2020 to 5.4% at
December 31, 2021. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets used in determining pension expense for non-U.S. plans is
determined in a similar manner to the U.S. plans.
Another key assumption in determining net pension and OPEB expense is the assumed discount rate used to discount plan
obligations. We estimate the assumed discount rate for U.S. plans using a cash flow matching approach, which uses projected cash
flows matched to spot rates along a high quality corporate bond yield curve to determine the weighted-average discount rate for the
calculation of the present value of cash flows. We apply the individual annual yield curve rates instead of the assumed discount rate
to determine the service cost and interest cost, which more specifically links the cash flows related to service cost and interest cost to
bonds maturing in their year of payment.
The Society of Actuaries (SOA) issued mortality improvement tables in the three months ended December 31, 2021. We reviewed
our recent mortality experience and we determined our current mortality assumptions are appropriate to measure our U.S. pension
and OPEB plans obligations as of December 31, 2021.
Significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect the pension obligations.
The effects of actual results differing from assumptions and the changing of assumptions are included in unamortized net actuarial
gains and losses that are subject to amortization to pension expense over future periods. The unamortized pre-tax actuarial loss on
our pension plans was $3.7 billion and $8.4 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020. The year-over-year change is primarily due to
an increase in discount rates and higher than expected asset returns.
The underfunded status of the U.S. pension plans improved in the year ended December 31, 2021 to $0.3 billion from $5.4 billion
primarily due to: (1) the favorable effect of actual returns on plan assets of $3.7 billion; (2) the favorable effect of an increase in
discount rates of $2.1 billion; and (3) changes in actuarial assumptions, demographic data updates and contributions of $0.5 billion;
partially offset by (4) service and interest costs of $1.3 billion.
The following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for the pension plans, holding all other
assumptions constant:

strategies, assumptions, the change in benefit obligations and related plan assets, pension funding requirements and future net benefit
payments. Refer to Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the inputs used to determine fair value for
each significant asset class or category.
Valuation of Deferred Tax Assets The ability to realize deferred tax assets depends on the ability to generate sufficient taxable
income within the carryback or carryforward periods provided for in the tax law for each applicable tax jurisdiction. The assessment
regarding whether a valuation allowance is required or should be adjusted is based on an evaluation of possible sources of taxable
income and also considers all available positive and negative evidence factors. Our accounting for the valuation of deferred tax
assets represents our best estimate of future events. Changes in our current estimates, due to unanticipated market conditions,
governmental legislative actions or events, could have a material effect on our ability to utilize deferred tax assets. Refer to Note 17
to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on the composition of valuation allowances.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
The overall financial risk management program is under the responsibility of the Chief Financial Officer with support from the
Financial Risk Council, which reviews and, where appropriate, approves strategies to be pursued to mitigate these risks. The
Financial Risk Council comprises members of our management and functions under the oversight of the Audit Committee and
Finance Committee of the Board of Directors. The Audit Committee and Finance Committee assist and guide the Board of Directors
in its oversight of our financial and risk management strategies. A risk management control framework is utilized to monitor the
strategies, risks and related hedge positions in accordance with the policies and procedures approved by the Financial Risk Council.
Our financial risk management policy is designed to protect against risk arising from extreme adverse market movements on our key
exposures.
Automotive The following analyses provide quantitative information regarding exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk,
interest rate risk and equity price risk. Sensitivity analysis is used to measure the potential loss in the fair value of financial
instruments with exposure to market risk. The models used assume instantaneous, parallel shifts in exchange rates and interest rate
yield curves. For options and other instruments with nonlinear returns, models appropriate to these types of instruments are utilized
to determine the effect of market shifts. There are certain shortcomings inherent in the sensitivity analyses presented, primarily due
to the assumption that interest rates change in a parallel fashion and that spot exchange rates change instantaneously. In addition, the
analyses are unable to reflect the complex market reactions that normally would arise from the market shifts modeled and do not
contemplate the effects of correlations between foreign currency exposures and offsetting long-short positions in currency or other
exposures, such as interest rates, which may significantly reduce the potential loss in value.
Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk We have foreign currency exposures related to buying, selling and financing in currencies
other than the functional currencies of our operations. At December 31, 2021, our most significant foreign currency exposures were
between the U.S. Dollar and the Canadian Dollar, Chinese Yuan, Korean Won, Brazilian Real, Euro, and Mexican Peso. Derivative
instruments such as foreign currency forwards, swaps and options are primarily used to hedge exposures with respect to forecasted
revenues, costs and commitments denominated in foreign currencies. Such contracts had remaining maturities of up to 12 months at
December 31, 2021.
 
The net fair value liability of financial instruments with exposure to foreign currency risk was $0.7 billion and $0.9 billion at
December 31, 2021 and 2020. These amounts are calculated utilizing a population of foreign currency exchange derivatives and
foreign currency denominated debt and exclude the offsetting effect of foreign currency cash, cash equivalents and other assets. The
potential loss in fair value for such financial instruments from a 10% adverse change in all quoted foreign currency exchange rates
would have been insignificant at December 31, 2021 and 2020.
We are exposed to foreign currency risk due to the translation and remeasurement of the results of certain international operations
into U.S. Dollars as part of the consolidation process. We had foreign currency derivatives with notional amounts of $4.2 billion and
$2.2 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020. The fair value of these derivative financial instruments was insignificant. Fluctuations
in foreign currency exchange rates can therefore create volatility in the results of operations and may adversely affect our financial
condition.
The following table summarizes the amounts of automotive foreign currency translation and transaction and remeasurement
(gains) losses:
Years Ended December 31,
2021 2020
Translation (gains) losses recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss $ (132)$ 387 
Transaction and remeasurement (gains) losses recorded in earnings $ (15)$ 209 
Interest Rate Risk We are subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates related to certain financial instruments,
primarily debt, finance lease obligations and certain marketable debt securities. We did not have any interest rate swap positions to
manage interest rate exposures in our automotive operations at December 31, 2021 and 2020. The fair value of debt and finance
leases was $20.6 billion and $21.6 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020. The potential increase in fair value resulting from a 10%
decrease in quoted interest rates would have been $0.6 billion and $0.7 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020.

Table of Contents
GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES
We had marketable debt securities of $8.6 billion and $9.0 billion classified as available-for-sale at December 31, 2021 and 2020.
The potential decrease in fair value from a 50 basis point increase in interest rates would have been insignificant at December 31,
2021 and 2020.
Equity Price Risk We are subject to equity price risk due to market price volatility primarily related to our investment in Stellantis
warrants and other insignificant investments. The fair value of investments with exposure to equity price risk was $1.5 billion and
$1.2 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020. Our investment in Stellantis warrants is valued based on a Black-Scholes formula. We
estimate that a 10% adverse change in quoted security prices in Stellantis would have had an insignificant effect at December 31,
2021 and 2020.
Automotive Financing - GM Financial
Interest Rate Risk Fluctuations in market interest rates can affect GM Financial's gross interest rate spread, which is the difference
between interest earned on finance receivables and interest paid on debt. GM Financial is exposed to interest rate risks as financial
assets and liabilities have different characteristics that may impact financial performance. These differences may include tenor, yield,
re-pricing timing, and prepayment expectations. Typically retail finance receivables and leases purchased by GM Financial earn
fixed interest and commercial finance receivables originated by GM Financial earn variable interest. GM Financial funds its business
with variable or fixed rate debt. The variable rate debt is subject to adjustments to reflect prevailing market interest rates. To help
mitigate interest rate risk or mismatched funding, GM Financial may employ hedging.
Quantitative Disclosure GM Financial measures the sensitivity of its net interest income to changes in interest rates by using
interest rate scenarios that assume a hypothetical, instantaneous parallel shift of one hundred basis points in all interest rates across
all maturities, as well as a base case that assumes that rates perform at the current market forward curve. However, interest rate
changes are rarely instantaneous or parallel and rates could move more or less than the one percentage point assumed in our analysis.
Therefore, the actual impact to net interest income could be higher or lower than the results detailed in the table below. These
interest rate scenarios are purely hypothetical and do not represent our view of future interest rate movements.
At December 31, 2021, GM Financial was liability-sensitive, meaning that more liabilities than assets were expected to re-price
within the next twelve months. During a period of rising interest rates, the interest paid on liabilities would increase more than the
interest earned on assets, which would initially decrease net interest income. During a period of falling interest rates, net interest
income would be expected to initially increase. At December 31, 2020, GM Financial was asset-sensitive, meaning that more assets
than liabilities were expected to re-price within the next twelve months. During a period of rising interest rates, the interest earned
on assets would increase more than the interest paid on liabilities, which would initially increase net interest income. During a period
of falling interest rates, net interest income would be expected to initially decrease.
GM Financial's net interest income sensitivity decreased in 2021 as compared to 2020 primarily due to an increased proportion of
rate sensitive liabilities exposure relative to rate sensitive assets exposure. GM Financial's hedging strategies approved by its global
asset liability committee are used to manage interest rate risk within policy guidelines. The following table presents GM Financial's
net interest income sensitivity to interest rate movement:
Years Ended December 31,
2021 2020
One hundred basis points instantaneous increase in interest rates $ (5.1)$ 29.7 
One hundred basis points instantaneous decrease in interest rates(a) $ 5.1 $ (29.7)
__________
(a)    Net interest income sensitivity given a one hundred basis point decrease in interest rates requires an assumption of negative interest rates in
markets where existing interest rates are below one percent.
Additional Model Assumptions The sensitivity analysis presented is GM Financial's best estimate of the effect of the hypothetical
interest rate scenarios; however, actual results could differ. The estimates are also based on assumptions including the amortization
and prepayment of the finance receivable portfolio, originations of finance receivables and leases, refinancing of maturing debt,
replacement of maturing derivatives and exercise of options embedded in debt and derivatives. The prepayment projections are
based on historical experience. If interest rates or other factors change, actual prepayment experience could be different than
projected.

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk GM Financial is exposed to foreign currency risk due to the translation and
remeasurement of the results of certain international operations into U.S. Dollars as part of the consolidation process. Fluctuations in
foreign currency exchange rates can therefore create volatility in the results of operations and may adversely affect GM Financial's
financial condition.
GM Financial primarily finances its receivables and leased assets with debt in the same currency. When a different currency is
used GM Financial may use foreign currency swaps to convert substantially all of its foreign currency debt obligations to the local
currency of the receivables and leased assets to minimize any impact to earnings. As a result, GM Financial believes its market risk
exposure relating to changes in currency exchange rates at December 31, 2021 was insignificant.
GM Financial had foreign currency swaps with notional amounts of $8.2 billion and $7.6 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020.
The net fair value of these derivative financial instruments was a liability of $0.2 billion and an asset of $0.4 billion at December 31,
2021 and 2020.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of General Motors Company
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of General Motors Company and subsidiaries (the Company) as of
December 31, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, cash flows, and equity for each
of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial
statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at
December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2021, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)
(PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal
Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013
framework) and our report dated February 2, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to
be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or
fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether
due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis,
evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial
statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were
communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material
to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of
critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by
communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or
disclosures to which they relate.
Product warranty and recall campaigns
Description of the matter As discussed in Note 12 to the financial statements, the liabilities for product warranty and recall
campaigns amount to $9.8 billion at December 31, 2021. The Company accrues for costs related to
product warranty at the time of vehicle sale and accrues the estimated cost of recall campaigns when
they are probable and estimable.
Auditing these liabilities involved a high degree of subjectivity in evaluating management’s
estimates, due to the size, uncertainties, and potential volatility related to the estimated liabilities.
Management’s estimates consider historical claims experience, including the nature, frequency, and
average cost of claims of each vehicle line or each model year of the vehicle line, and the key
assumptions of historical data being predictive of future activity and events, in particular, the
number of historical periods used and the weighing of historical data in the reserve studies.
49
Table of Contents
How we addressed the matter
in our auditWe evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls over the
Company’s product warranty and recall campaign processes. We tested internal controls over
management’s review of the valuation models and significant assumptions for product warranty and
recall, including the warranty claims forecasted based on the frequency and average cost per
warranty claim for product warranty, and the cost estimates related to recall campaigns. Our audit
also included the evaluation of controls that address the completeness and accuracy of the data
utilized in the valuation models.
Our audit procedures related to product warranty and recall campaigns also included, among others,
evaluating the Company’s estimation methodology, the related significant assumptions and
underlying data, and performing analytical procedures to corroborate cost per vehicle based on
historical claims data. Furthermore, we performed sensitivity analyses to evaluate the significant
judgments made by management, including cost estimates to evaluate the impact on reserves from
changes in assumptions. We performed analysis over the vehicle lines and model years that had little
or no claims experience to ensure the vehicle and model substitutions are comparable. We also
involved actuarial specialists to evaluate the methodologies and assumptions, and to test the
actuarial calculations used by the Company.
Sales incentives
Description of the matter Automotive sales and revenue represents the amount of consideration to which the Company
expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or providing services, which is net of dealer
and customer sales incentives the Company expects to pay. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial
statements, provisions for dealer and customer incentives are recorded as a reduction to Automotive
net sales and revenue at the time of vehicle sale. The liabilities for dealer and customer allowances,
claims and discounts amount to $3.2 billion at December 31, 2021.
Auditing the estimate of sales incentives involved a high degree of judgment. Significant factors
used by the Company in estimating its liability for retail incentives include type of program,
forecasted sales volumes, product mix, and the rate of customer acceptance of incentive programs,
all of which are estimated based on historical experience and assumptions concerning future
customer behavior and market conditions. The Company’s estimation model reflects the best
estimate of the total incentive amount that the Company reasonably expects to pay at the time of
sale. The estimated cost of incentives is forward-looking, and could be materially affected by future
economic and market conditions.
How we addressed the matter
in our auditWe evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls over the
Company’s sales incentive process, including management’s review of the estimation model, the
significant assumptions (e.g., incentive cost per unit, customer take rate, and market conditions), and
the data inputs used in the model.
Our audit procedures included, among others, the performance of analytical procedures to develop
an independent range of the liability for retail incentives as of the balance sheet date. Our
independent range was developed for comparison to the Company’s recorded liability, and is based
on historical claims, forecasted spend, and the specific vehicle mix of current dealer stock. In
addition, we performed sensitivity analyses over the cost per unit assumption developed by
management to evaluate the impact on the liability resulting from a change in the assumption.
Lastly, we assessed management’s forecasting process by performing quarterly hindsight analyses to
assess the adequacy of prior forecasts.
Valuation of GM Financial Equipment on Operating Leases
Description of the matter GM Financial has recorded investments in vehicles leased to retail customers under operating
leases. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, at the beginning of the lease, management
establishes an expected residual value for each vehicle at the end of the lease term. The Company’s
estimated residual value of leased vehicles at the end of lease term was $29.1 billion as of December
31, 2021.
50
Table of Contents
Auditing management’s estimate of the residual value of leased vehicles involved a high degree of
judgment. Management’s estimate is based, in part, on third-party data which considers inputs
including recent auction values and significant assumptions regarding the expected future volume of
leased vehicles that will be returned to the Company, used car prices, manufacturer incentive
programs and fuel prices. Realization of the residual values is dependent on the future ability to
market the vehicles under future prevailing market conditions.
How we addressed the matter
in our auditWe evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the Company’s controls over the
lease residual estimation process, including controls over management’s review of residual value
estimates obtained from the Company’s third-party provider and other significant assumptions.
 
Our procedures also included, among others, independently recalculating depreciation related to
equipment on operating leases and performing sensitivity analyses related to significant
assumptions. We also performed hindsight analyses to assess the propriety of management’s
estimate of residual values, as well as tested the completeness and accuracy of data from underlying
systems and data warehouses that are used in the estimation models.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
 
To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of General Motors Company
Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited General Motors Company and subsidiaries’ internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021,
based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, General Motors Company and subsidiaries (the
Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on
the COSO criteria.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)
(PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated statements
of income, comprehensive income, cash flows and equity for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, and the
related notes and our report dated February 2, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment
of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal
Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with
respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities
and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects.
Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material
weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to
the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only
in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material
effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because
of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Note 1. Nature of Operations and Basis of Presentation
General Motors Company was incorporated as a Delaware corporation in 2009. We design, build and sell trucks, crossovers, cars
and automobile parts, provide software-enabled services worldwide and are investing in and growing an AV business. We also
provide automotive financing services through GM Financial. We analyze the results of our operations through the following
segments: GMNA, GMI, Cruise and GM Financial. Cruise is our global segment responsible for the development and
commercialization of AV technology. Nonsegment operations are classified as Corporate. Corporate includes certain centrally
recorded income and costs such as interest, income taxes, corporate expenditures and certain nonsegment-specific revenues and
expenses. The consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP. Except for per share amounts or as
otherwise specified, amounts presented within tables are stated in millions.
Principles of Consolidation We consolidate entities that we control due to ownership of a majority voting interest and we
consolidate variable interest entities (VIEs) when we are the primary beneficiary. All intercompany balances and transactions have
been eliminated in consolidation. Our share of earnings or losses of nonconsolidated affiliates is included in our consolidated
operating results using the equity method of accounting when we are able to exercise significant influence over the operating and
financial decisions of the affiliate.
Use of Estimates in the Preparation of the Financial Statements Accounting estimates are an integral part of the consolidated
financial statements. These estimates require the use of judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses in the periods presented. We believe that the accounting estimates employed are appropriate and the resulting
balances are reasonable; however, due to the inherent uncertainties in making estimates, actual results could differ from the original
estimates, requiring adjustments to these balances in future periods.
GM Financial The amounts presented for GM Financial have been adjusted to reflect the impact on GM Financial's deferred tax
positions and provision for income taxes resulting from the inclusion of GM Financial in our consolidated tax return and to eliminate
the effect of transactions between GM Financial and the other members of the consolidated group. Accordingly, the amounts
presented will differ from those presented by GM Financial on a stand-alone basis.
Note 2. Significant Accounting Policies
The accounting policies that follow are utilized by our automotive, automotive financing and Cruise operations, unless otherwise
indicated. We adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-13 "Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326):
Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments" (ASU 2016-13) on January 1, 2020 on a modified retrospective basis. As
such, the comparative information in prior periods was not restated and continues to be reported under the accounting standards in
effect for those periods. The accounting policies for Marketable Debt Securities, Accounts and Notes Receivable and GM Financial
Receivables that were affected by the adoption of ASU 2016-13 became effective on January 1, 2020.
Revenue Recognition
Automotive Automotive net sales and revenue represents the amount of consideration to which we expect to be entitled in
exchange for vehicle, parts and accessories and services and other sales. The consideration recognized represents the amount
received, typically shortly after the sale to a customer, net of estimated dealer and customer sales incentives we reasonably expect to
pay. Significant factors in determining our estimates of incentives include forecasted sales volume, product mix and the rate of
customer acceptance of incentive programs, all of which are estimated based on historical experience and assumptions concerning
future customer behavior and market conditions. Subsequent adjustments to incentive estimates are possible as facts and
circumstances change over time. A portion of the consideration received is deferred for separate performance obligations, such as
maintenance and vehicle connectivity, that will be provided to our customers at a future date. Taxes assessed by various government
entities, such as sales, use and value-added taxes, collected at the time of the vehicle sale are excluded from Automotive net sales
and revenue. Costs for shipping and handling activities that occur after control of the vehicle transfers to the dealer are recognized at
the time of sale and presented in Automotive and other cost of sales.
Vehicle, Parts and Accessories For the majority of vehicle and accessories sales, our customers obtain control and we recognize
revenue when the vehicle transfers to the dealer, which generally occurs when the vehicle is released to the carrier responsible for
transporting it to a dealer. Revenue, net of estimated returns, is recognized on the sale of parts upon delivery to the customer. When
our customers have a right to return eligible parts and accessories, we consider the returns in our estimation of the transaction price.

GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)
Typically, transfers to daily rental companies are accounted for as sales, with revenue recognized at the time of transfer. We defer
revenue for remarketing obligations, record a residual value guarantee and reflect a liability for amounts expected to be paid once
the remarketing services are complete at the time of certain transfers and recognize deferred revenue in earnings upon completion of
the remarketing service.
Used Vehicles Proceeds from the auction of vehicles utilized by our employees are recognized in Automotive net sales and
revenue upon transfer of control of the vehicle to the customer and the related vehicle carrying value is recognized in Automotive
and other cost of sales.
Services and Other Services and other revenue primarily consists of revenue from vehicle-related service arrangements and after-
sale services such as maintenance, OnStar, vehicle connectivity and extended service warranties. For those service arrangements that
are bundled with a vehicle sale, a portion of the revenue from the sale is allocated to the service component and recognized as
deferred revenue within Accrued liabilities or Other liabilities. We recognize revenue for bundled services and services sold
separately as services are performed, typically over a period of up to seven years.
Automotive Financing - GM Financial Finance charge income earned on finance receivables is recognized using the effective
interest method. Fees and commissions received (including incentive payments) and direct costs of originating loans are deferred
and amortized over the term of the related finance receivables using the effective interest method and are removed from the
consolidated balance sheets when the related finance receivables are fully charged off or paid in full. Accrual of finance charge
income on retail finance receivables is generally suspended on accounts that are more than 60 days delinquent, accounts in
bankruptcy and accounts in repossession. Payments received on nonaccrual loans are first applied to any fees due, then to any
interest due and then any remaining amounts are applied to principal. Interest accrual generally resumes once an account has
received payments bringing the delinquency to less than 60 days past due. Accrual of finance charge income on commercial finance
receivables is generally suspended on accounts that are more than 90 days delinquent, upon receipt of a bankruptcy notice from a
borrower, or where reasonable doubt exists about the full collectability of contractually agreed upon principal and interest. Payments
received on nonaccrual loans are first applied to principal. Interest accrual resumes once an account has received payments bringing
the account fully current and collection of contractual principal and interest is reasonably assured (including amounts previously
charged off).
Income from operating lease assets, which includes lease origination fees, net of lease origination costs, is recorded as operating
lease revenue on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease agreement. Gains or losses realized upon disposition of off-lease
assets including any payments received from lessees upon lease termination, are included in GM Financial interest, operating and
other.
Advertising and Promotion Expenditures Advertising and promotion expenditures, which are expensed as incurred in Automotive
and other selling, general and administrative expense, were $3.3 billion, $2.7 billion and $3.7 billion in the years ended December
31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.
Research and Development Expenditures Research and development expenditures, which are expensed as incurred in Automotive
and other cost of sales, were $7.9 billion, $6.2 billion and $6.8 billion in the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. We
enter into cost sharing arrangements with third parties or nonconsolidated affiliates for product-related research, engineering, design
and development activities. Cost sharing payments and fees related to these arrangements are presented in Automotive and other cost
of sales.
Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash Cash equivalents are defined as short-term, highly-liquid investments with original
maturities of 90 days or less. Certain operating agreements require us to post cash as collateral. Cash and cash equivalents subject to
contractual restrictions and not readily available are classified as restricted cash. Restricted cash is invested in accordance with the
terms of the underlying agreements and include amounts related to various deposits, escrows and other cash collateral. Restricted
cash is included in Other current assets and Other assets in the consolidated balance sheets.
Fair Value Measurements A three-level valuation hierarchy, based upon observable and unobservable inputs, is used for fair value
measurements. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect market
assumptions based on the best evidence available. These two types of inputs create the following fair value hierarchy: Level 1 –
Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets; Level 2 – Quoted prices for similar instruments
58
Table of Contents
GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)
in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and model-derived valuations
whose significant inputs are observable; and Level 3 – Instruments whose significant inputs are unobservable.
Marketable Debt Securities We generally classify marketable debt securities as available-for-sale. Various factors, including
turnover of holdings and investment guidelines, are considered in determining the classification of securities. Available-for-sale debt
securities are recorded at fair value with non-credit related unrealized gains and losses recorded in Accumulated other
comprehensive loss until realized. Credit losses are recorded in Interest income and other non-operating income, net. An evaluation
is made quarterly to determine if any portion of unrealized losses recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss needs to be
reclassified. Non-credit related unrealized losses are reclassified to Interest income and other non-operating income, net if we intend
to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before the recovery of the unrealized loss.
We determine realized gains and losses for all debt securities using the specific identification method and measure the fair value of
our marketable debt securities using a market approach where identical or comparable prices are available and an income approach
in other cases. If quoted market prices are not available, fair values of securities are determined using prices from a pricing service,
pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or discounted cash flow models. These prices represent non-
binding quotes. Our pricing service utilizes industry-standard pricing models that consider various inputs. We typically review our
pricing service quarterly and believe the prices received from our pricing service are a reliable representation of exit prices.
Accounts and Notes Receivable Accounts and notes receivable primarily consists of amounts that are due and payable from our
customers for the sale of vehicles, parts, and accessories. We evaluate the collectability of receivables each reporting period and
record an allowance for doubtful accounts to present the net amount expected to be collected on our receivables. Additions to the
allowance are charged to bad debt expense reported in Automotive and other selling, general and administrative expense and were
insignificant in the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.
GM Financial Receivables Finance receivables are carried at amortized cost, net of allowance for loan losses. Provisions for loan
losses are charged to operations in amounts sufficient to maintain the allowance for loan losses at levels considered adequate to
cover expected credit losses on the finance receivables. For retail finance receivables, GM Financial uses static pool modeling
techniques to determine the allowance for loan losses expected over the remaining life of the receivables, which is supplemented by
management judgment. The modeling techniques incorporate reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic conditions over the
expected remaining life of the finance receivables. The economic forecasts incorporate factors which vary by region that GM
Financial believes will have the largest impact on expected losses, including unemployment rates, interest rate spreads, disposable
personal income and growth rates in gross domestic product.
Troubled debt restructurings (TDRs) are grouped separately for purposes of measuring the allowance. The allowance for TDRs
uses static pool modeling techniques like non-TDR retail finance receivables to determine the expected loss amount. The expected
cash flows of the receivables are then discounted at the original weighted average effective interest rate of the pool. Factors
considered when estimating the allowance for TDRs are based on an evaluation of historical and current information, which may be
supplemented by management judgment. Finance charge income from loans classified as TDRs is accounted for in the same manner
as other accruing loans. Cash collections on these loans are allocated according to the same payment hierarchy methodology applied
to loans that are not classified as TDRs.
Commercial finance receivables are carried at amortized cost, net of allowance for loan losses and amounts held under a cash
management program. GM Financial establishes the allowance for loan losses based on historical loss experience, as well as the
forecast for industry vehicle sales, which is the economic indicator believed to have the largest impact on expected losses.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in
the ordinary course of business less cost to sell, and considers general market and economic conditions, periodic reviews of current
profitability of vehicles, product warranty costs and the effect of estimated sales incentives. Net realizable value for off-lease and
other vehicles is current auction sales proceeds less disposal and warranty costs. Productive material, supplies, work in process and
service parts are reviewed to determine if inventory quantities are in excess of forecasted usage or if they have become obsolete.
Equipment on Operating Leases Equipment on operating leases, net primarily consists of vehicle leases to retail customers with
lease terms of two to five years. We are exposed to changes in the residual values of these assets. The residual values represent
estimates of the values of the leased vehicles at the end of the lease agreements and are determined based on
59
Table of Contents
GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)
forecasted auction proceeds when there is a reliable basis to make such a determination. Realization of the residual values is
dependent on the future ability to market the vehicles under prevailing market conditions. The estimate of the residual value is
evaluated over the life of the arrangement and adjustments may be made to the extent the expected value of the vehicle changes.
Adjustments may be in the form of revisions to the depreciation rate or recognition of an impairment charge. A lease vehicle asset
group is determined to be impaired if an impairment indicator exists and the expected future cash flows, which include estimated
residual values, are lower than the carrying amount of the vehicle asset group. If the carrying amount is considered impaired an
impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds fair value of the vehicle asset group. Fair value
is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows, including estimated residual values. In our automotive finance operations
when a leased vehicle is returned or repossessed the asset is recorded in Other assets at the lower of amortized cost or net realizable
value. Upon disposition a gain or loss is recorded in GM Financial interest, operating and other expenses for any difference between
the net book value of the leased asset and the proceeds from the disposition of the asset.
Equity Investments When events and circumstances warrant, equity investments accounted for under the equity method of
accounting are evaluated for impairment. An impairment charge is recorded whenever a decline in value of an equity investment
below its carrying amount is determined to be other-than-temporary. Impairment charges related to equity method investments are
recorded in Equity income. Equity investments that are not accounted for under the equity method of accounting are measured at fair
value or in certain cases adjusted to fair value upon an observable price change, with changes in fair value recorded in Interest
income and other non-operating income, net.
Property, net Property, plant and equipment, including internal use software, is recorded at cost. Major improvements that extend
the useful life or add functionality are capitalized. The gross amount of assets under finance leases is included in property, plant and
equipment. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred. We depreciate depreciable property using
the straight-line method. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the period of lease or the life of the asset, whichever is shorter.
The amortization of the assets under finance leases is included in depreciation expense. Upon retirement or disposition of property,
plant and equipment, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated and any resulting gain or loss is recorded in
earnings. Impairment charges related to property are recorded in Automotive and other cost of sales, Automotive and other selling,
general and administrative expense or GM Financial interest, operating and other expenses.
Special Tools Special tools represent product-specific propulsion and non-propulsion related tools, dies, molds and other items used
in the vehicle manufacturing process. Expenditures for special tools are recorded at cost and are capitalized. We amortize special
tools over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method or an accelerated amortization method based on their historical
and estimated production volume. Impairment charges related to special tools are recorded in Automotive and other cost of sales.
Goodwill Goodwill is not amortized but rather tested for impairment annually on October 1 and when events warrant such a review.
The impairment test entails an assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that an impairment
exists. If it is more likely than not that an impairment exists, then a quantitative impairment test is performed. Impairment exists
when the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value.
Intangible Assets, net Intangible assets, excluding goodwill, primarily include brand names, technology and intellectual property,
customer relationships and dealer networks. Intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line or an accelerated method of
amortization over their estimated useful lives. An accelerated amortization method reflecting the pattern in which the asset will be
consumed is utilized if that pattern can be reliably determined. We consider the period of expected cash flows and underlying data
used to measure the fair value of the intangible assets when selecting a useful life. Amortization of developed technology and
intellectual property is recorded in Automotive and other cost of sales. Amortization of brand names, customer relationships and our
dealer networks is recorded in Automotive and other selling, general and administrative expense or GM Financial interest, operating
and other expenses. Impairment charges, if any, related to intangible assets are recorded in Automotive and other selling, general and
administrative expense or Automotive and other cost of sales.
Valuation of Long-Lived Assets The carrying amount of long-lived assets and finite-lived intangible assets to be held and used in
the business is evaluated for impairment when events and circumstances warrant. If the carrying amount of a long-lived asset group
is considered impaired, a loss is recorded based on the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds fair value. Product-specific
long-lived asset groups and non-product specific long-lived assets are separately tested for impairment on an asset group basis. Fair
value is determined using either the market or sales comparison approach, cost approach or anticipated
60
Table of Contents
GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)
cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved. Long-lived assets to be disposed of other than by sale are
considered held for use until disposition.
Pension and OPEB Plans
Attribution, Methods and Assumptions The cost of benefits provided by defined benefit pension plans is recorded in the period
employees provide service. The cost of pension plan amendments that provide for benefits already earned by plan participants is
amortized over the expected period of benefit which may be the duration of the applicable collective bargaining agreement specific
to the plan, the expected future working lifetime or the life expectancy of the plan participants.
The cost of medical, dental, legal service and life insurance benefits provided through postretirement benefit plans is recorded in
the period employees provide service. The cost of postretirement plan amendments that provide for benefits already earned by plan
participants is amortized over the expected period of benefit which may be the average period to full eligibility or the average life
expectancy of the plan participants.
An expected return on plan asset methodology is utilized to calculate future pension expense for certain significant funded benefit
plans. A market-related value of plan assets methodology is also utilized that averages gains and losses on the plan assets over a
period of years to determine future pension expense. The methodology recognizes 60% of the difference between the fair value of
assets and the expected calculated value in the first year and 10% of that difference over each of the next four years.
The discount rate assumption is established for each of the retirement-related benefit plans at their respective measurement dates.
In the U.S., we use a cash flow matching approach that uses projected cash flows matched to spot rates along a high-quality
corporate bond yield curve to determine the present value of cash flows to calculate a single equivalent discount rate. We apply
individual annual yield curve rates to determine the service cost and interest cost for our pension and OPEB plans to more
specifically link the cash flows related to service cost and interest cost to bonds maturing in their year of payment.
The benefit obligation for pension plans in Canada, the U.K. and Germany represents 93% of the non-U.S. pension benefit
obligation at December 31, 2021. The discount rates for plans in Canada, the U.K. and Germany are determined using a cash flow
matching approach like the U.S.
Plan Asset Valuation Due to the lack of timely available market information for certain investments in the asset classes described
below as well as the inherent uncertainty of valuation, reported fair values may differ from fair values that would have been used had
timely available market information been available.
Common and Preferred Stock Common and preferred stock for which market prices are readily available at the measurement date
are valued at the last reported sale price or official closing price on the primary market or exchange on which they are actively traded
and are classified in Level 1. Such equity securities for which the market is not considered to be active are valued via the use of
observable inputs, which may include the use of adjusted market prices last available, bids or last available sales prices and/or other
observable inputs and are classified in Level 2. Common and preferred stock classified in Level 3 are privately issued securities or
other issues that are valued via the use of valuation models using significant unobservable inputs that generally consider aged (stale)
pricing, earnings multiples, discounted cash flows and/or other qualitative and quantitative factors.
Debt Securities Valuations for debt securities are based on quotations received from independent pricing services or from dealers
who make markets in such securities. Debt securities priced via pricing services that utilize matrix pricing which considers readily
observable inputs such as the yield or price of bonds of comparable quality, coupon, maturity and type as well as dealer supplied
prices, are classified in Level 2. Debt securities that are typically priced by dealers and pricing services via the use of proprietary
pricing models which incorporate significant unobservable inputs are classified in Level 3. These inputs primarily consist of yield
and credit spread assumptions, discount rates, prepayment curves, default assumptions and recovery rates.
Investment Funds, Private Equity and Debt Investments and Real Estate Investments Investment funds, private equity and debt
investments and real estate investments are valued based on the Net Asset Value (NAV) per Share (or its equivalent) as a practical
expedient to estimate fair value due to the absence of readily available market prices.
61
Table of Contents
GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)
NAV's are provided by the respective investment sponsors or investment advisers and are subsequently reviewed and approved by
management. In the event management concludes a reported NAV does not reflect fair value or is not determined as of the financial
reporting measurement date, we will consider whether and when deemed necessary to make an adjustment at the balance sheet date.
In determining whether an adjustment to the external valuation is required, we will review material factors that could affect the
valuation, such as changes in the composition or performance of the underlying investments or comparable investments, overall
market conditions, expected sale prices for private investments which are probable of being sold in the short-term and other
economic factors that may possibly have a favorable or unfavorable effect on the reported external valuation.
Stock Incentive Plans Our stock incentive plans include RSUs, Restricted Stock Awards (RSAs), PSUs, stock options and awards
that may be settled in our stock, the stock of our subsidiaries or in cash. We measure and record compensation expense based on the
fair value of GM or Cruise's common stock on the date of grant for RSUs, RSAs and PSUs and the grant date fair value, determined
utilizing a lattice model or the Black-Scholes formula, for stock options and PSUs. We record compensation cost for service-based
RSUs, RSAs, PSUs and service-based stock options on a straight-line basis over the entire vesting period, or for retirement eligible
employees over the requisite service period. RSUs granted in stock of Cruise vest upon satisfaction of both a service condition and a
liquidity condition, defined as a change in control transaction or the consummation of an initial public offering. Compensation costs
for RSUs granted in stock of Cruise will be recorded when the liquidity condition is met. Compensation cost for awards that do not
have an established accounting grant date, but for which the service inception date has been established, or are settled in cash is
based on the fair value of GM or Cruise's common stock at the end of each reporting period. We use the graded vesting method to
record compensation cost for stock options with market conditions over the lesser of the vesting period or the time period an
employee becomes eligible to retain the award at retirement.
Product Warranty and Recall Campaigns The estimated costs related to product warranties are accrued at the time products are
sold and are charged to Automotive and other cost of sales. These estimates are established using historical information on the
nature, frequency and average cost of claims of each vehicle line or each model year of the vehicle line and assumptions about future
activity and events. Revisions are made when necessary and are based on changes in these factors.
The estimated costs related to recall campaigns are accrued when probable and estimable. In GMNA, we estimate the costs related
to recall campaigns by applying a paid loss approach that considers the number of historical recall campaigns and the estimated cost
for each recall campaign. The estimated costs associated with recall campaigns in other geographical regions are determined using
the estimated costs of repairs and the estimated number of vehicles to be repaired. Costs associated with recall campaigns are
charged to Automotive and other cost of sales. Revisions are made when necessary based on changes in these factors.
Income Taxes The liability method is used in accounting for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for
temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the consolidated financial
statements using the statutory tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect on deferred
tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax laws or rates is recorded in the results of operations in the period that includes the
enactment date under the law. We record Global Intangible Low Tax Income (GILTI) as a current period expense when incurred.
We establish valuation allowances for deferred tax assets based on a more likely than not standard. Deferred income tax assets are
evaluated quarterly to determine if valuation allowances are required or should be adjusted. The ability to realize deferred tax assets
depends on the ability to generate sufficient taxable income within the carryback or carryforward periods provided for in the tax law
for each applicable tax jurisdiction. The assessment regarding whether a valuation allowance is required or should be adjusted also
considers all available positive and negative evidence factors. It is difficult to conclude a valuation allowance is not required when
there is significant objective and verifiable negative evidence, such as cumulative losses in recent years. We utilize a rolling three
years of actual and current year results as the primary measure of cumulative losses in recent years.
We record uncertain tax positions on the basis of a two-step process whereby we determine whether it is more likely than not that
the tax positions will be sustained based on the technical merits of the position, and for those tax positions that meet the more likely
than not criteria, we recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate
settlement with the related tax authority. We record interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions in Income tax expense.

Foreign Currency Transactions and Translation The assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries that use the local currency as
their functional currency are translated to U.S. Dollars based on the current exchange rate prevailing at each balance sheet date and
any resulting translation adjustments are included in Accumulated other comprehensive loss. The assets and liabilities of foreign
subsidiaries whose local currency is not their functional currency are remeasured from their local currency to their functional
currency and then translated to U.S. Dollars. Revenues and expenses are translated into U.S. Dollars using the average exchange
rates prevailing for each period presented. The financial statements of any foreign subsidiary that has been identified as having a
highly inflationary economy are remeasured as if the functional currency were the U.S. Dollar.
Gains and losses arising from foreign currency transactions and the effects of remeasurements discussed in the preceding
paragraph are recorded in Automotive and other cost of sales and GM Financial interest, operating and other expenses unless related
to Automotive debt, which are recorded in Interest income and other non-operating income, net. Foreign currency transaction and
remeasurement gains were $17 million, losses of $203 million and gains of $85 million in the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020
and 2019.
Derivative Financial Instruments Derivative financial instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities at fair value. The
accounting for changes in the fair value of each derivative financial instrument depends on whether it has been designated and
qualifies as an accounting hedge, as well as the type of hedging relationship identified. Derivative instruments are not used for

The decrease in the allowance for loan losses as of December 31, 2021 compared to December 31, 2020 was primarily due to a
reduction in the reserve levels established at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. This reduction was a result of actual credit
performance that was better than forecasted and favorable expectations for future charge-offs and recoveries, reflecting improved
economic conditions. These decreases in the reserve levels were partially offset by reserves established for loans originated during
the year ended December 31, 2021.

GM Financial reviews the ongoing credit quality of retail finance receivables based on customer payment activity. A retail account
is considered delinquent if a substantial portion of a scheduled payment has not been received by the date the payment was
contractually due. Retail finance receivables are collateralized by vehicle titles and, subject to local laws, GM Financial generally
has the right to repossess the vehicle in the event the customer defaults on the payment terms of the contract. The accrual of finance
charge income had been suspended on delinquent retail finance receivables with contractual amounts due of $602 million and $714
million at December 31, 2021 and 2020. The following tables are consolidated summaries of the delinquency status of the

Commercial Finance Receivables GM Financial's commercial finance receivables consist of dealer financings, primarily for
dealer inventory purchases. Proprietary models are used to assign a risk rating to each dealer. GM Financial performs periodic credit
reviews of each dealership and adjusts the dealership's risk rating, if necessary. There were no commercial finance receivables on
nonaccrual status at December 31, 2021 and an insignificant amount at December 31, 2020.
GM Financial's commercial risk model and risk rating categories are as follows:
Rating Description
IPerforming accounts with strong to acceptable financial metrics with at least satisfactory capacity to meet financial
commitments.
IIPerforming accounts experiencing potential weakness in financial metrics and repayment prospects resulting in
increased monitoring.
IIINon-Performing accounts with inadequate paying capacity for current obligations and have the distinct possibility of
creating a loss if deficiencies are not corrected.
IVNon-Performing accounts with inadequate paying capacity for current obligations and inherent weaknesses that make
collection of liquidation in full highly questionable or improbable.
Dealers with III and IV risk ratings are subject to additional monitoring and restrictions on funding, including suspension of lines
of credit and liquidation of assets. The following tables summarize the credit risk profile by dealer risk rating of commercial finance
receivables at December 31, 2021 and 2020:

Note 8. Equity in Net Assets of Nonconsolidated Affiliates
Nonconsolidated affiliates are entities in which we maintain an equity ownership interest and for which we use the equity method
of accounting due to our ability to exert significant influence over decisions relating to their operating and financial affairs. Revenue
and expenses of our joint ventures are not consolidated into our financial statements; rather, our proportionate share of the earnings
of each joint venture is reflected as Equity income.

Note 11. Variable Interest Entities
Consolidated VIEs
Automotive Financing - GM Financial
GM Financial uses special purpose entities (SPEs) that are considered VIEs to issue variable funding notes to third party bank-
sponsored warehouse facilities or asset-backed securities to investors in securitization transactions. The debt issued by these VIEs is
backed by finance receivables and leasing-related assets transferred to the VIEs (Securitized Assets). GM Financial determined that
it is the primary beneficiary of the SPEs because the servicing responsibilities for the Securitized Assets give GM Financial the
power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the performance of the VIEs and the variable interests in the VIEs give
GM Financial the obligation to absorb losses and the right to receive residual returns that could potentially be significant. The assets
of the VIEs serve as the sole source of repayment for the debt issued by these entities. Investors in the notes issued by the VIEs do
not have recourse to GM Financial or its other assets, with the exception of customary representation and warranty repurchase
provisions and indemnities that GM Financial provides as the servicer. GM Financial is not required to provide additional financial
support to these SPEs. While these subsidiaries are included in GM Financial's consolidated financial statements, they are separate
legal entities and their assets are legally owned by them and are not available to GM Financial's creditors.
The following table summarizes the assets and liabilities related to GM Financial's consolidated VIEs:
December 31, 2021 December 31, 2020
Restricted cash – current $ 2,291 $ 2,190 
Restricted cash – non-current $ 449 $ 449 
GM Financial receivables, net of fees – current $ 15,344 $ 17,211 
GM Financial receivables, net of fees – non-current $ 16,518 $ 15,107 
GM Financial equipment on operating leases, net $ 16,143 $ 16,322 
GM Financial short-term debt and current portion of long-term debt $ 19,876 $ 20,450 
GM Financial long-term debt $ 19,401 $ 18,974 
GM Financial recognizes finance charge, leased vehicle and fee income on the Securitized Assets and interest expense on the
secured debt issued in a securitization transaction and records a provision for loan losses to recognize loan losses expected over the
remaining life of the finance receivables.
Nonconsolidated VIEs
Automotive
Nonconsolidated VIEs principally include automotive related operating entities to which we provided financial support to ensure
that our supply needs for production are met or are not disrupted. Our variable interests in these nonconsolidated VIEs include
equity investments, accounts and loans receivable, committed financial support and other off-balance sheet arrangements. The
carrying amounts of assets were $846 million and liabilities were insignificant related to our

nonconsolidated VIEs at December 31, 2021. The carrying amounts of assets and liabilities related to our nonconsolidated VIEs
were insignificant at December 31, 2020. Our maximum exposure to loss as a result of our involvement with these VIEs was
$2.1 billion and $1.2 billion, inclusive of $1.2 billion and $776 million in committed capital contributions to Ultium Cells LLC at
December 31, 2021 and 2020. We currently lack the power through voting or similar rights to direct the activities of these entities
that most significantly affect their economic performance.

to the Chevrolet Bolt recall. In addition, we reached an agreement with LG Electronics, Inc. (LG) under which LG will reimburse
GM for costs and expenses associated with the recall, which substantially offsets the warranty charges we recognized in connection
with the recall. Refer to Note 16 to our consolidated financial statements for more details on the Chevrolet Bolt recall and associated
supplier recovery. We estimate our reasonably possible loss in excess of amounts accrued for recall campaigns to be insignificant at
December 31, 2021.

Secured debt consists of revolving credit facilities and securitization notes payable. Most of the secured debt was issued by VIEs
and is repayable only from proceeds related to the underlying pledged assets. Refer to Note 11 for additional information on GM
Financial's involvement with VIEs. GM Financial is required to hold certain funds in restricted cash accounts to provide additional
collateral for borrowings under certain secured credit facilities. The weighted-average interest rate on secured debt was 1.27% at
December 31, 2021. The revolving credit facilities have maturity dates ranging from 2022 to 2027 and securitization notes payable
have maturity dates ranging from 2022 to 2034. At the end of the revolving period, if not renewed, the debt of revolving credit
facilities will amortize over a defined period. In the year ended December 31, 2021, GM Financial renewed revolving credit
facilities with total borrowing capacity of $25.8 billion and issued $23.3 billion in aggregate principal amount of securitization notes
payable with an initial weighted average interest rate of 0.79% and maturity dates ranging from 2022 to 2034.
Unsecured debt consists of senior notes, credit facilities and other unsecured debt. Senior notes outstanding at December 31, 2021
have maturity dates ranging from 2022 to 2031 and have a weighted-average interest rate of 2.77%. In the year ended December 31,
2021, GM Financial issued $12.2 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior notes with an initial weighted average interest rate
of 1.62% and maturity dates ranging from 2024 to 2031.
In September 2021, GM Financial redeemed $1.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of 5.2% senior notes due in 2023. The
redemption resulted in a $105 million loss on the early extinguishment of debt. The loss is included in GM Financial interest,
operating and other expenses.
In January 2022, GM Financial issued $2.6 billion in senior notes with a weighted average interest rate of 2.57% and maturity
dates ranging from 2027 to 2032.

Compliance with Debt Covenants Several of our loan facilities, including our revolving credit facilities, require compliance with
certain financial and operational covenants as well as regular reporting to lenders, including providing certain subsidiary financial
statements. Certain of GM Financial’s secured debt agreements also contain various covenants, including maintaining portfolio
performance ratios as well as limits on deferment levels. GM Financial’s unsecured debt obligations contain covenants including
limitations on GM Financial's ability to incur certain liens. Failure to meet certain of these requirements may result in a covenant
violation or an event of default depending on the terms of the agreement. An event of default may allow lenders to declare amounts
outstanding under these agreements immediately due and payable, to enforce their interests against collateral pledged under these
agreements or restrict our ability or GM Financial's ability to obtain additional borrowings. No technical defaults or covenant
violations existed at December 31, 2021.

Note 15. Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits
Employee Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans
Defined Benefit Pension Plans Defined benefit pension plans covering eligible U.S. hourly employees (hired prior to October
2007) and Canadian hourly employees (hired prior to October 2016) generally provide benefits of negotiated, stated amounts for
each year of service and supplemental benefits for employees who retire with 30 years of service before normal retirement age. The
benefits provided by the defined benefit pension plans covering eligible U.S. (hired prior to January 1, 2001) and Canadian salaried
employees and employees in certain other non-U.S. locations are generally based on years of service and compensation history.
Accrual of defined pension benefits ceased in 2012 for U.S. and Canadian salaried employees. There is also an unfunded
nonqualified pension plan primarily covering U.S. executives for service prior to January 1, 2007 and it is based on an “excess plan”
for service after that date.

GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)
The funding policy for qualified defined benefit pension plans is to contribute annually not less than the minimum required by
applicable laws and regulations or to directly pay benefit payments where appropriate. In the year ended December 31, 2021 all legal
funding requirements were met. The following table summarizes contributions made to the defined benefit pension plans:
Years Ended December 31,
2021 2020 2019
U.S. hourly and salaried $ 67 $ 68 $ 83 
Non-U.S. 371 396 532 
Total $ 438 $ 464 $ 615 
We expect to contribute approximately $70 million to our U.S. non-qualified plans and approximately $500 million to our non-
U.S. pension plans in 2022.
Based on our current assumptions, over the next five years we expect no significant mandatory contributions to our U.S. qualified
pension plans and mandatory contributions totaling $290 million to our U.K. and Canada pension plans.
Other Postretirement Benefit Plans Certain hourly and salaried defined benefit plans provide postretirement medical, dental,
legal service and life insurance to eligible U.S. and Canadian retirees and their eligible dependents. Certain other non-U.S.
subsidiaries have postretirement benefit plans, although most non-U.S. employees are covered by government sponsored or
administered programs. We made contributions to the U.S. OPEB plans of $351 million, $343 million and $326 million in the years
ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. Plan participants' contributions were insignificant in the years ended December 31, 2021,
2020 and 2019.
Defined Contribution Plans We have defined contribution plans for eligible U.S. salaried and hourly employees that provide
discretionary matching contributions. Contributions are also made to certain non-U.S. defined contribution plans. We made
contributions to our defined contribution plans of $606 million, $573 million and $537 million in the years ended December 31,

Other Remeasurements The SOA issued mortality improvement tables in the three months ended December 31, 2021 and
December 31, 2020. We reviewed our recent mortality experience and we determined our current mortality assumptions are
appropriate to measure our U.S. pension and OPEB plans obligations as of December 31, 2021. In 2020, we incorporated the SOA
mortality improvement tables into our December 31, 2020 measurement of U.S. pension and OPEB plans' benefit obligations. The
change in these assumptions decreased U.S. pension and OPEB plans’ obligations by $686 million as of December 31, 2020.

Assumptions
Investment Strategies and Long-Term Rate of Return Detailed periodic studies are conducted by our internal asset management
group as well as outside actuaries and are used to determine the long-term strategic mix among asset classes, risk mitigation
strategies and the expected long-term return on asset assumptions for the U.S. pension plans. The U.S. study includes a review of
alternative asset allocation and risk mitigation strategies, anticipated future long-term performance and risk of the individual asset
classes that comprise the plans' asset mix. Similar studies are performed for the significant non-U.S. pension plans with the
assistance of outside actuaries and asset managers. While the studies incorporate data from recent plan performance and historical
returns, the expected rate of return on plan assets represents our estimate of long-term prospective rates of return.
We continue to pursue various options to fund and de-risk our pension plans, including continued changes to the pension asset
portfolio mix to reduce funded status volatility. The strategic asset mix and risk mitigation strategies for the plans are tailored
specifically for each plan. Individual plans have distinct liabilities, liquidity needs and regulatory requirements. Consequently there
are different investment policies set by individual plan fiduciaries. Although investment policies and risk mitigation strategies may
differ among plans, each investment strategy is considered to be appropriate in the context of the specific factors affecting each plan.
In setting new strategic asset mixes, consideration is given to the likelihood that the selected asset mixes will effectively fund the
projected pension plan liabilities, while aligning with the risk tolerance of the plans' fiduciaries. The strategic asset mixes for U.S.
defined benefit pension plans are increasingly designed to satisfy the competing objectives of improving funded positions (market
value of assets equal to or greater than the present value of the liabilities) and mitigating the possibility of a deterioration in funded
status.
Derivatives may be used to provide cost effective solutions for rebalancing investment portfolios, increasing or decreasing
exposure to various asset classes and for mitigating risks, primarily interest rate, equity and currency risks. Equity and fixed income
managers are permitted to utilize derivatives as efficient substitutes for traditional securities. Interest rate derivatives may be used to
adjust portfolio duration to align with a plan's targeted investment policy and equity derivatives may be used to protect equity
positions from downside market losses. Alternative investment managers are permitted to employ leverage, including through the
use of derivatives, which may alter economic exposure.
In December 2021, an investment policy study was completed for the U.S. pension plans. As a result of changes to our capital
market assumptions, the weighted-average long-term rate of return on assets decreased from 5.6% at December 31, 2020 to 5.4% at
December 31, 2021. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets used in determining pension expense for non-U.S. plans is
determined in a similar manner to the U.S. plans.
Target Allocation Percentages The following table summarizes the target allocations by asset category for U.S. and non-U.S.

Investment Fund Strategies Investment funds include hedge funds, funds of hedge funds, equity funds and fixed income funds.
Hedge funds and funds of hedge funds managers typically seek to achieve their objectives by allocating capital across a broad array
of funds and/or investment managers. Equity funds invest in U.S. common and preferred stocks as well as similar equity securities
issued by companies incorporated, listed or domiciled in developed and/or emerging market countries. Fixed
83
Table of Contents
GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)
income funds include investments in high quality funds and, to a lesser extent, high yield funds. High quality fixed income funds
invest in government securities, investment-grade corporate bonds and mortgage and asset-backed securities. High yield fixed
income funds invest in high yield fixed income securities issued by corporations which are rated below investment grade. Other
investment funds also included in this category primarily represent multi-strategy funds that invest in broadly diversified portfolios
of equity, fixed income and derivative instruments.
Private equity and debt investments primarily consist of investments in private equity and debt funds. These investments provide
exposure to and benefit from long-term equity investments in private companies, including leveraged buy-outs, venture capital and
distressed debt strategies.
Real estate investments include funds that invest in entities which are primarily engaged in the ownership, acquisition,
development, financing, sale and/or management of income-producing real estate properties, both commercial and residential. These
funds typically seek long-term growth of capital and current income that is above average relative to public equity funds.
Significant Concentrations of Risk The assets of the pension plans include certain investment funds, private equity and debt
investments and real estate investments. Investment managers may be unable to quickly sell or redeem some or all of these
investments at an amount close or equal to fair value in order to meet a plan's liquidity requirements or to respond to specific events
such as deterioration in the creditworthiness of any particular issuer or counterparty.
Illiquid investments held by the plans are generally long-term investments that complement the long-term nature of pension
obligations and are not used to fund benefit payments when currently due. Plan management monitors liquidity risk on an ongoing
basis and has procedures in place that are designed to maintain flexibility in addressing plan-specific, broader industry and market
liquidity events.
The pension plans may invest in financial instruments denominated in foreign currencies and may be exposed to risks that the
foreign currency exchange rates might change in a manner that has an adverse effect on the value of the foreign currency
denominated assets or liabilities. Forward currency contracts may be used to manage and mitigate foreign currency risk.
The pension plans may invest in debt securities for which any change in the relevant interest rates for particular securities might
result in an investment manager being unable to secure similar returns upon the maturity or the sale of securities. In addition,
changes to prevailing interest rates or changes in expectations of future interest rates might result in an increase or decrease in the
fair value of the securities held. Interest rate swaps and other financial derivative instruments may be used to manage interest rate
risk.
Benefit Payments Benefits for most U.S. pension plans and certain non-U.S. pension plans are paid out of plan assets rather than
our Cash and cash equivalents. The following table summarizes net benefit payments expected to be paid in the future, which
include assumptions related to estimated future employee service:

when we believe that losses are probable and can be reasonably estimated. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had accruals of
$1.4 billion and $1.2 billion in Accrued liabilities and Other liabilities. In many matters, it is inherently

difficult to determine whether loss is probable or reasonably possible or to estimate the size or range of the possible loss.
Accordingly adverse outcomes from such proceedings could exceed the amounts accrued by an amount that could be material to our
results of operations or cash flows in any particular reporting period.
GM Korea Wage Litigation GM Korea Company (GM Korea) is party to litigation with current and former salaried employees
over whether to include fixed bonuses in the calculation of Ordinary Wages due under Korean regulations. In 2017, the Seoul High
Court (an intermediate-level appellate court) held that certain workers are not barred from filing retroactive wage claims. GM Korea
appealed this ruling to the Korea Supreme Court. In June 2021, the Korea Supreme Court affirmed the adverse rulings of the Seoul
High Court. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2021, our total accrual relating to this matter was insignificant and we estimate our
reasonably possible loss in excess of amounts accrued to be insignificant.
GM Korea is also party to litigation with current and former subcontract workers over allegations that they are entitled to the same
wages and benefits provided to full-time employees, and to be hired as full-time employees. In May 2018 and September 2020, the
Korean labor authorities issued adverse administrative orders finding that GM Korea must hire certain current subcontract workers
as full-time employees. GM Korea appealed the May 2018 and September 2020 orders. In June 2020, the Seoul High Court ruled
against GM Korea in one of the subcontract worker claims. GM Korea has appealed this decision to the Korea Supreme Court. At
December 31, 2021, our accrual covering certain asserted claims and claims that we believe are probable of assertion and for which
liability is probable was approximately $281 million. We estimate the reasonably possible loss in excess of amounts accrued for
other current subcontract workers who may assert similar claims to be approximately $111 million at December 31, 2021. We are
currently unable to estimate any possible loss or range of loss that may result from additional claims that may be asserted by former
subcontract workers.
GM Brazil Indirect Tax Claim In 2019, the Superior Court of Brazil rendered favorable decisions on three cases brought by GM
Brazil that granted the Company the right to recover certain tax overpayments collected by the government. As a result, GM Brazil
recorded pre-tax recoveries of $1.4 billion in the year ended December 31, 2019. GM Brazil is currently realizing those recoveries as
there are federal tax liabilities eligible for offset. On August 12, 2021, the Brazilian Supreme Court published its final decision on a
Motion of Clarification filed by the Brazilian IRS in a related case that confirmed GM Brazil's right to recover the tax overpayments
retroactively. GM is also engaged in settlement negotiations with certain third parties who have asserted entitlement to some or all of
the tax recoveries recognized by GM Brazil. Accordingly, we recorded an accrual of $194 million in the three months ended
December 31, 2021.
Other Litigation-Related Liability and Tax Administrative Matters Various other legal actions, including class actions,
governmental investigations, claims and proceedings, are pending against us or our related companies or joint ventures, including
matters arising out of alleged product defects; employment-related matters; product and workplace safety, vehicle emissions and fuel
economy regulations; product warranties; financial services; dealer, supplier and other contractual relationships; government
regulations relating to competition issues; tax-related matters not subject to the provision of Accounting Standards Codification 740,
Income Taxes (indirect tax-related matters); product design, manufacture and performance; consumer protection laws; and
environmental protection laws, including laws regulating air emissions, water discharges, waste management and environmental
remediation from stationary sources.
There are several putative class actions pending against GM in federal courts in the U.S. and in the Provincial Courts in Canada
alleging that various vehicles sold, including model year 2011-2016 Duramax Diesel Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra vehicles,
violate federal, state and foreign emission standards. We are unable to estimate any reasonably possible loss or range of loss that
may result from these actions. GM has also faced a series of additional lawsuits in the U.S. based on these allegations, including a
shareholder demand lawsuit that remains pending.
We believe that appropriate accruals have been established for losses that are probable and can be reasonably estimated. It is
possible that the resolution of one or more of these matters could exceed the amounts accrued in an amount that could be material to
our results of operations. We also from time to time receive subpoenas and other inquiries or requests for information from agencies
or other representatives of U.S. federal, state and foreign governments on a variety of issues. Beyond the class action litigations
disclosed, we have several other class action litigations pending at any given time. Historically, relatively few classes have been
certified in these types of cases. Therefore, we will generally only disclose specific class actions if a class is certified and we believe
there is a reasonably possible material exposure to the company.
Indirect tax-related matters are being litigated globally pertaining to value added taxes, customs, duties, sales, property taxes and
other non-income tax related tax exposures. The various non-U.S. labor-related matters include claims from current and
85

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)
former employees related to alleged unpaid wage, benefit, severance and other compensation matters. Certain administrative
proceedings are indirect tax-related and may require that we deposit funds in escrow or provide an alternative form of security. Some
of the matters may involve compensatory, punitive or other treble damage claims, environmental remediation programs or sanctions
that, if granted, could require us to pay damages or make other expenditures in amounts that could not be reasonably estimated at
December 31, 2021. We believe that appropriate accruals have been established for losses that are probable and can be reasonably
estimated. For indirect tax-related matters we estimate our reasonably possible loss in excess of amounts accrued to be up to
approximately $900 million at December 31, 2021.
Takata Matters In November 2020, the NHTSA directed that we replace the airbag inflators in our GMT900 vehicles, which are
full-size pickup trucks and SUVs, and we decided not to contest NHTSA's decision. While we have already begun the process of
executing the recall, given the number of vehicles in this population, the recall will take several years to be completed. Accordingly,
in the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded a warranty accrual of $1.1 billion for the expected costs of complying with the
recall remedy, and we believe the currently accrued amount remains reasonable.
GM has recalled certain vehicles sold outside of the U.S. to replace Takata Corporation (Takata) inflators in those vehicles. There
are significant differences in vehicle and inflator design between the relevant vehicles sold internationally and those sold in the U.S.
We continue to gather and analyze evidence about these inflators and to share our findings with regulators. Any additional recalls
relating to these inflators could be material to our results of operations and cash flows.
There are several putative class actions that have been filed against GM, including in the federal courts in the U.S., in the
Provincial Courts in Canada and in Mexico, arising out of allegations that airbag inflators manufactured by Takata are defective. At
this stage of these proceedings, we are unable to provide an estimate of the amounts or range of possible loss.
Chevrolet Bolt Recall In July 2021, we initiated a voluntary recall for certain 2017-2019 model year Chevrolet Bolt EVs due to the
risk that two manufacturing defects present in the same battery cell could cause a high voltage battery fire in certain of these
vehicles. Accordingly, in the three months ended June 30, 2021, we recorded a warranty accrual of $812 million. After further
investigation into the manufacturing processes at our battery supplier, LG, and disassembling battery packs, we determined that the
risk of battery cell defects was not confined to the initial recall population. As a result, in August 2021, we expanded the recall to
include all 2017-2022 model year Chevrolet Bolt EV and EUVs and recorded an additional warranty accrual of $1.2 billion in the
three months ended September 30, 2021. In October 2021, we reached an agreement with LG, under which LG will reimburse GM
for costs and expenses associated with the recall. As a result, in the three months ended September 30, 2021, we recognized a
receivable of $1.9 billion, which substantially offsets the warranty charges we recognized in connection with the recall. These
charges reflect our current best estimate for the cost of the recall remedy. The actual costs of the recall and GM's associated recovery
from LG could be higher or lower. For 2017-2019 model year vehicles, the recall remedy will be to replace the high voltage battery
modules in these vehicles with new modules. For 2020-2022 model year vehicles, the recall remedy will be to replace any defective
high voltage battery modules in these vehicles with new modules.
In addition, putative class actions have been filed against GM in federal courts in the U.S. and in the Provincial Courts in Canada
alleging that the batteries contained in the Bolt EVs included in the recall population are defective. At this stage of these
proceedings, we are unable to provide an estimate of the amounts or range of possible loss.
Opel/Vauxhall Sale In 2017, we sold the Opel/Vauxhall Business to PSA Group (now Stellantis) under a Master Agreement (the
Agreement). We also sold the European financing subsidiaries and branches (together with the Opel/Vauxhall Business, the
European Business) to Banque PSA Finance S.A. and BNP Paribas Personal Finance S.A. Although the sale reduced our new vehicle
presence in Europe, we may still be impacted by actions taken by regulators related to vehicles sold before the sale. Our wholly
owned subsidiary (the Seller) agreed to indemnify Stellantis for certain losses resulting from any inaccuracy of the representations
and warranties or breaches of our covenants included in the Agreement and for certain other liabilities, including certain emissions
and product liabilities. Currently, various consumer lawsuits have been filed against the Seller and Stellantis in Germany, the United
Kingdom, and the Netherlands alleging that Opel and Vauxhall vehicles sold by the Seller violated applicable emission standards.
We are unable to estimate any reasonably possible loss or range of loss that may result from these actions either directly or through
an indemnification claim from Stellantis. The Company entered into a guarantee for the benefit of Stellantis and pursuant to which
the Company agreed to guarantee the Seller's obligation to indemnify Stellantis. Certain of these indemnification obligations are
subject to time limitations, thresholds and/or caps as to the amount of required payments.

following the sale. The following table summarizes transactions with the Opel/Vauxhall Business:
Years Ended December 31,
2021 2020 2019
Net sales and revenue $ 114 $ 144 $ 1,129 
Purchases and expenses $ 121 $ 392 $ 825 
Cash payments(a) $ 226 $ 630 $ 975 
Cash receipts(a) $ 146 $ 252 $ 1,408 
__________
(a)    Included in Net cash provided by operating activities.
Patent Royalty Matters Several owners of patents are seeking past royalties from various automotive manufacturers, including
GM, for the use of certain technologies. Accordingly, in the three months ended December 31, 2021, we accrued approximately
$290 million relating to these matters. As of December 31, 2021, our total accrual relating to these matters was approximately $300
million and we estimate our reasonably possible loss in excess of amounts accrued to be insignificant.
Product Liability We recorded liabilities of $587 million and $589 million in Accrued liabilities and Other liabilities at December
31, 2021 and 2020, for the expected cost of all known product liability claims, plus an estimate of the expected cost for product
liability claims that have already been incurred and are expected to be filed in the future for which we are self-insured. It is
reasonably possible that our accruals for product liability claims may increase in future periods in material amounts, although we
cannot estimate a reasonable range of incremental loss based on currently available information. We believe that any judgment
against us involving our products for actual damages will be adequately covered by our recorded accruals and, where applicable,
excess liability insurance coverage.
Guarantees We enter into indemnification agreements for liability claims involving products manufactured primarily by certain
joint ventures. These guarantees terminate in years ranging from 2022 to 2026 or upon the occurrence of specific events or are
ongoing. We believe that the related potential costs incurred are adequately covered by our recorded accruals, which are
insignificant. The maximum future undiscounted payments mainly based on vehicles sold to date were $3.1 billion for these
guarantees at December 31, 2021 and 2020, the majority of which relates to the indemnification agreements.
We provide payment guarantees on commercial loans outstanding with third parties such as dealers. In some instances certain
assets of the party or our payables to the party whose debt or performance we have guaranteed may offset, to some degree, the
amount of any potential future payments. We are also exposed to residual value guarantees associated with certain sales to rental car
companies.
We periodically enter into agreements that incorporate indemnification provisions in the normal course of business. It is not
possible to estimate our maximum exposure under these indemnifications or guarantees due to the conditional nature of these
obligations. Insignificant amounts have been recorded for such obligations as the majority of them are not probable or estimable at
this time and the fair value of the guarantees at issuance was insignificant. Refer to the Opel/Vauxhall Sale section of this note for
additional information on our indemnification obligations to Stellantis under the Agreement.
Credit Cards Credit card programs offer rebates that can be applied primarily against the purchase or lease of our vehicles. At
December 31, 2021 and 2020, our redemption liability was insignificant, our deferred revenue was $309 million and $252 million,
and qualified cardholders had rebates available, net of deferred program revenue, of $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion. Our redemption
liability and deferred revenue are recorded in Accrued liabilities and Other liabilities.

balance of $ 5.4 billion may be carried forward indefinitely .
Valuation Allowances During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, valuation allowances against deferred tax assets of
$8.9 billion and $9.1 billion were comprised of cumulative losses, credits and other timing differences, primarily in Germany, Spain,
South Korea and the U.S.
Uncertain Tax Positions The following table summarizes activity of the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits:
Years Ended December 31,

favorably affect our effective tax rate in the future. In the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 income tax related interest
and penalties were insignificant. At December 31, 2021 and 2020 we had liabilities of $86 million and $92 million for income tax
related interest and penalties.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)
At December 31, 2021 it is not possible to reasonably estimate the expected change to the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next twelve months.
Other Matters Income tax returns are filed in multiple jurisdictions and are subject to examination by taxing authorities throughout
the world. We have open tax years from 2011 to 2021 with various significant tax jurisdictions. Tax authorities may have the ability
to review and adjust net operating loss or tax credit carryforwards that were generated prior to these periods if utilized in an open tax
year. These open years contain matters that could be subject to differing interpretations of applicable tax laws and regulations as they
relate to the amount, character, timing or inclusion of revenue and expenses or the sustainability of income tax credits for a given
audit cycle.
Note 18. Restructuring and Other Initiatives
We have executed various restructuring and other initiatives and we may execute additional initiatives in the future, if necessary,
to streamline manufacturing capacity and reduce other costs to improve the utilization of remaining facilities. To the extent these
programs involve voluntary separations, a liability is generally recorded at the time offers to employees are accepted. To the extent
these programs provide separation benefits in accordance with pre-existing agreements, a liability is recorded once the amount is
probable and reasonably estimable. If employees are involuntarily terminated, a liability is generally recorded at the communication
date. Related charges are recorded in Automotive and other cost of sales and Automotive and other selling, general and
administrative expense.
The following table summarizes the reserves and charges related to restructuring and other initiatives, including postemployment
benefit reserves and charges:
Years Ended December 31,
2021 2020 2019
Balance at beginning of period $ 352 $ 564 $ 1,122 
Additions, interest accretion and other 216 565 629 
Payments (278) (678) (1,101)
Revisions to estimates and effect of foreign currency (5) (99) (86)
Balance at end of period $ 285 $ 352 $ 564 
In the year ended December 31, 2020, restructuring and other initiatives primarily included actions in GMI related to the wind-
down of Holden sales, design and engineering operations in Australia and New Zealand, the sale of our vehicle and powertrain
manufacturing facilities in Thailand and the execution of a binding term sheet to sell our manufacturing facility in India. We
recorded charges of $683 million in the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily consisting of $360 million in dealer restructurings,
employee separations and supplier claim charges, which are reflected in the table above, and $323 million in property and intangible
asset impairments, inventory provisions, sales allowances and other charges, not reflected in the table above. We also recorded a
$236 million charge to Income tax expense due to the establishment of a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets in Australia
and New Zealand in the year ended December 31, 2020. We incurred $197 million in net cash outflows in the year ended December
31, 2020 and $254 million in net cash outflows since program inception resulting from these restructuring actions primarily for
dealer restructuring payments and employee separation payments, which includes proceeds of $143 million from the sale of our
manufacturing facilities in Thailand. Holden and Thailand programs were substantially complete at December 31, 2020.
In the year ended December 31, 2019, restructuring and other initiatives primarily included actions related to our announced
transformation activities, which include unallocation of products to certain manufacturing facilities and other employee separation
programs. We recorded charges of $1.8 billion, primarily in GMNA, in the year ended December 31, 2019 consisting of $1.3 billion
primarily in non-cash accelerated depreciation and pension curtailment and other charges, not reflected in the table above, and $535
million primarily in supplier-related charges and employee-related separation charges, which are reflected in the table above. These
programs have a total cost since inception of $3.1 billion and were complete at December 31, 2019. We incurred $333 million and
$1.1 billion in cash outflows resulting from these restructuring actions, primarily for employee separation payments and supplier-
related payments in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. The cash outflows were substantially complete at December 31,
2020.

default exist that can trigger redemption of the Cruise Class G Preferred Shares. The Cruise Class G Preferred Shares are entitled to
receive the greater of their carrying value or a pro-rata share of any proceeds or distributions upon the occurrence of a merger, sale,
liquidation or dissolution of Cruise Holdings, and are classified as noncontrolling interests in our consolidated financial statements.

Preferred Shares) and Cruise Class F Preferred Shares convert into the class of shares to be issued to the public in an IPO at
specified exchange ratios. Beginning on June 28, 2025, SoftBank has the option to convert all of the Cruise Class A-1 Preferred
Shares into our common stock at a conversion ratio that is indexed to the fair value of Cruise Holdings at the time of conversion. In
the event SoftBank exercises such option, we have the option to settle the conversion feature with our common shares or cash, and in
certain situations with nonredeemable, nonconvertible preferred shares. The Cruise Class A-1 Preferred Shares and Cruise Class F
Preferred Shares are entitled to receive the greater of their carrying value or a pro-rata share of any proceeds or distributions upon
the occurrence of a merger, sale, liquidation or dissolution of Cruise Holdings.

Note 22. Stock Incentive Plans
GM Stock Incentive Awards We grant to certain employees RSUs, RSAs, PSUs and stock options (collectively, stock incentive
awards) under our 2016 Equity Incentive Plan and 2020 LTIP and prior to the 2020 LTIP, under our 2017 and 2014 LTIP. The 2020
LTIP was approved by stockholders in June 2020. Any new awards granted after the approval of the 2020 LTIP in June 2020 will be
issued under the 2020 LTIP. To the extent any shares remain available for issuance under the 2017 LTIP, the 2016 Equity Incentive
Plan, and/or the 2014 LTIP, such shares will only be used to settle outstanding awards that were previously granted under such plans
prior to June 2020. Shares awarded under the plans are subject to forfeiture if the participant leaves the company for reasons other
than those permitted under the plans such as retirement, death or disability.
RSU awards granted either cliff vest or ratably vest generally over a three-year service period, as defined in the terms of each
award. PSU awards vest at the end of a three-year performance period, based on performance criteria determined by the Executive
Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors at the time of award. The number of shares earned may equal, exceed or be less
than the targeted number of shares depending on whether the performance criteria are met, surpassed or not met. Stock options
expire 10 years from the grant date. Our performance-based stock options vest ratably over 55 months based on the performance of
our common stock relative to that of a specified peer group. Our service-based stock options vest ratably over 19 months to three
years.
In connection with our acquisition of Cruise Automation, Inc. in May 2016, RSAs and PSUs in common shares of GM were
granted to employees of Cruise Holdings. The RSAs vest ratably, generally over a three-year service period. The PSUs are
contingent upon achievement of specific technology and commercialization milestones.

Our weighted-average assumptions used to value our stock options are a dividend yield of 1.67%, 4.25% and 3.90%, expected
volatility of 47.8%, 26.2% and 28.0%, a risk-free interest rate of 0.76%, 1.44% and 2.62%, and an expected option life of 6.00, 5.97
and 6.00 years for options issued during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. The expected volatility is based on the
average of the implied volatility of publicly traded options for our common stock.
Total compensation expense related to the above awards was $391 million, $351 million and $456 million in the years ended
December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.
At December 31, 2021, the total unrecognized compensation expense for nonvested equity awards granted was $235 million. This
expense is expected to be recorded over a weighted-average period of 1.1 years. The total fair value of stock incentive awards vested
was $258 million, $275 million and $287 million in the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.
Cruise Stock Incentive Awards In addition to the awards noted above, RSUs were granted to Cruise employees in common shares
of Cruise Holdings in the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. During the year ending December 31, 2021, we granted
29.4 million RSUs with a weighted average grant date fair value of $25.15 to Cruise employees. Stock options were granted in
common shares of Cruise Holdings in the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2019. During the year ending December 31, 2021, we
granted 3.3 million stock options with a weighted average grant date fair value of $13.54 to Cruise employees. These awards were
granted under the 2018 Employee Incentive Plan approved by Cruise Holdings' Board of Directors in August 2018. Shares awarded
under the plan are subject to forfeiture if the participant leaves the company for reasons other than those permitted under the plan.
Stock options vest ratably over four to 10 years, as defined in the terms of each award. Stock options expire 10 years from the grant
date. RSU awards granted vest upon the satisfaction of both a service condition and a liquidity condition. The service condition for
the majority of these awards is satisfied over four years. The liquidity condition is satisfied upon the earlier of the date of a change in
control transaction or the consummation of an initial public offering.
Total compensation expense related to Cruise Holdings’ share-based awards was insignificant for the years ended December 31,
2021, 2020 and 2019. Cash paid to settle share-based awards was insignificant for the year ended December 31, 2021. No share-
based compensation expense had been recognized for the outstanding RSUs because the liquidity condition described above was not
met at December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. Total unrecognized compensation expense for Cruise Holdings’ nonvested equity awards
granted was $1.3 billion at December 31, 2021, which was primarily comprised of 66.2 million units of RSUs for which the liquidity
condition had not been met. Total units outstanding were 90.0 million at December 31, 2021. The expense related to stock options is
expected to be recorded over a weighted-average period of 5.4 years. The timing of the expense related to RSUs will depend upon

We analyze the results of our business through the following reportable segments: GMNA, GMI, Cruise and GM Financial. The
chief operating decision-maker evaluates the operating results and performance of our automotive segments and Cruise through
EBIT-adjusted, which is presented net of noncontrolling interests. The chief operating decision-maker evaluates GM Financial
through EBT-adjusted because interest income and interest expense are part of operating results when assessing and measuring the
operational and financial performance of the segment. Each segment has a manager responsible for executing our strategic
initiatives. While not all vehicles within a segment are individually profitable on a fully allocated cost basis, those vehicles attract
customers to dealer showrooms and help maintain sales volumes for other, more profitable vehicles and

contribute towards meeting required fuel efficiency standards. As a result of these and other factors, we do not manage our business
on an individual brand or vehicle basis.
Substantially all of the trucks, crossovers, cars and automobile parts produced are marketed through retail dealers in North
America and through distributors and dealers outside of North America, the substantial majority of which are independently owned.
In addition to the products sold to dealers for consumer retail sales, trucks, crossovers and cars are also sold to fleet customers,
including daily rental car companies, commercial fleet customers, leasing companies and governments. Fleet sales are completed
through the dealer network and in some cases directly with fleet customers. Retail and fleet customers can obtain a wide range of
after-sale vehicle services and products through the dealer network, such as maintenance, light repairs, collision repairs, vehicle
accessories and extended service warranties.
GMNA meets the demands of customers in North America and GMI primarily meets the demands of customers outside North
America, with vehicles developed, manufactured and/or marketed under the Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet and GMC brands. We also
have equity ownership stakes in entities that meet the demands of customers in other countries, primarily China, with vehicles
developed, manufactured and/or marketed under the Baojun, Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet and Wuling brands. Cruise is our global
segment responsible for the development and commercialization of AV technology, and includes AV-related engineering and other
costs. We provide automotive financing services through our GM Financial segment.
Our automotive interest income and interest expense, legacy costs from the Opel/Vauxhall Business (primarily pension costs),
corporate expenditures and certain nonsegment specific revenues and expenses are recorded centrally in Corporate. Corporate assets
primarily consist of cash and cash equivalents, marketable debt securities, Stellantis warrants and intersegment balances. All
intersegment balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures
Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that
information required to be disclosed in reports filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within
the specified time periods and accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and
principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.
Our management, with the participation of our CEO and CFO, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act) as of December 31, 2021 as required
by paragraph (b) of Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15. Based on this evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and
procedures were effective as of December 31, 2021.
Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and
maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act.
This system is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Because of the inherent limitations of
internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls,
misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
Our management performed an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting at December 31,
2021, utilizing the criteria discussed in the “Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)” issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The objective of this assessment was to determine whether our internal
control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2021. Based on management's assessment, we have concluded that
our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2021.
The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP (PCAOB ID: 42), an
independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report included herein.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There have not been any changes in our internal control over financial
reporting during the three months ended December 31, 2021 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we are monitoring our control
environment with increased vigilance to ensure all increased risks are mitigated. For additional information refer to Part I, Item 1A.
