PART I
Item 1. Business
The Boeing Company, together with its subsidiaries (herein referred to as “Boeing,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” “our”), is
one of the world’s major aerospace firms.
We are organized based on the products and services we offer. We operate in four reportable segments:
•Commercial Airplanes (BCA);
•Defense, Space & Security (BDS);
•Global Services (BGS);
•Boeing Capital (BCC).
Commercial Airplanes Segment
This segment develops, produces and markets commercial jet aircraft and provides fleet support services, principally to
the commercial airline industry worldwide. We are a leading producer of commercial aircraft and offer a family of
commercial jetliners designed to meet a broad spectrum of global passenger and cargo requirements of airlines. This
family of commercial jet aircraft in production includes the 737 narrow-body model and the 747, 767, 777 and 787 wide-
body models. Development continues on the 777X program and certain 737 MAX derivatives.
Defense, Space & Security Segment
This segment engages in the research, development, production and modification of manned and unmanned military
aircraft and weapons systems for strike, surveillance and mobility, including fighter and trainer aircraft; vertical lift,
including rotorcraft and tilt-rotor aircraft; and commercial derivative aircraft, including anti-submarine and tanker aircraft.
In addition, this segment engages in the research, development, production and modification of the following products
and related services: strategic defense and intelligence systems, including strategic missile and defense systems,
command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (C4ISR), cyber and
information solutions, and intelligence systems; satellite systems, including government and commercial satellites and
space exploration.
BDS' primary customer is the United States Department of Defense (U.S. DoD). Revenues from the U.S. DoD,
including foreign military sales through the U.S. government, accounted for approximately 84% of its 2019 revenues.
Other significant BDS customers include the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and customers in
international defense, civil and commercial satellite markets.
This segment's primary products include the following fixed-wing military aircraft: F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, F-15
programs, P-8 programs, KC-46A Tanker, and T-7A Red Hawk. This segment produces rotorcraft and rotary-wing
programs, such as CH-47 Chinook, AH-64 Apache, and V-22 Osprey. Unmanned vehicles include the MQ-25, QF-16,
and Insitu’s Scan Eagle aircraft. In addition, this segment's products include space and missile systems including:
government and commercial satellites, NASA’s Space Launch System (SLS), the International Space Station,
Commercial Crew, missile defense and weapons programs, and Joint Direct Attack Munition, as well as the United
Launch Alliance joint venture.
Global Services Segment
This segment provides services to our commercial and defense customers worldwide. BGS sustains aerospace
platforms and systems with a full spectrum of products and services, including supply chain
1
Table of Contents
and logistics management, engineering, maintenance and modifications, upgrades and conversions, spare parts, pilot
and maintenance training systems and services, technical and maintenance documents, and data analytics and digital
services.
Boeing Capital Segment
BCC seeks to ensure that Boeing customers have the financing they need to buy and take delivery of their Boeing
product and manages overall financing exposure. BCC’s portfolio consists of equipment under operating leases, sales-
type/finance leases, notes and other receivables, assets held for sale or re-lease and investments.
Intellectual Property
We own numerous patents and have licenses for the use of patents owned by others, which relate to our products and
their manufacture. In addition to owning a large portfolio of intellectual property, we also license intellectual property to
and from third parties. For example, the U.S. government has licenses in our patents that are developed in
performance of government contracts, and it may use or authorize others to use the inventions covered by such
patents for government purposes. Unpatented research, development and engineering skills, as well as certain
trademarks, trade secrets, and other intellectual property rights, also make an important contribution to our business.
While our intellectual property rights in the aggregate are important to the operation of each of our businesses, we do
not believe that our business would be materially affected by the expiration of any particular intellectual property right or
termination of any particular intellectual property patent license agreement.
Employees
Total workforce level at December 31, 2019 was approximately 161,100. As of December 31, 2019, our principal
collective bargaining agreements were with the following unions:
UnionPercent of our
Employees
Represented Status of the Agreements with Major Union
The International Association of Machinists
and Aerospace Workers (IAM)22% We have two major agreements; one expiring in June
2022 and one in September 2024.
The Society of Professional Engineering
Employees in Aerospace (SPEEA)11% We have two major agreements expiring in October
2022.
The United Automobile, Aerospace and
Agricultural Implement Workers of America
(UAW)1% We have one major agreement expiring in October
2022.
Competition
The commercial jet aircraft market and the airline industry remain extremely competitive. We face aggressive
international competitors who are intent on increasing their market share, such as Airbus and other entrants from
Russia, China and Japan. We are focused on improving our processes and continuing cost reduction efforts. We intend
to continue to compete with other airplane manufacturers by providing customers with greater value products.
BDS faces strong competition in all market segments, primarily from Lockheed Martin Corporation, Northrop Grumman
Corporation, Raytheon Company, General Dynamics Corporation and SpaceX. Non-U.S.
2
Table of Contents
companies such as BAE Systems and Airbus Group continue to build a strategic presence in the U.S. market by
strengthening their North American operations and partnering with U.S. defense companies. In addition, certain
competitors have occasionally formed teams with other competitors to address specific customer requirements. BDS
expects the trend of strong competition to continue into 2020.
The commercial and defense services market is an extremely challenging landscape made up of many of the same
strong U.S. and non-U.S. competitors facing BCA and BDS along with other competitors in those markets. BGS
leverages our extensive services network offering products and services which span the life cycle of our defense and
commercial airplane programs: training, fleet services and logistics, maintenance and engineering, modifications and
upgrades - as well as the daily cycle of gate-to-gate operations. BGS expects the market to remain highly competitive
in 2020, and intends to grow market share by leveraging a high level of customer satisfaction and productivity.
Regulatory Matters
Our businesses are heavily regulated in most of our markets. We deal with numerous U.S. government agencies and
entities, including but not limited to all of the branches of the U.S. military, NASA, the Federal Aviation Administration
(FAA) and the Department of Homeland Security. Similar government authorities exist in our non-U.S. markets.
Government Contracts. The U.S. government, and other governments, may terminate any of our government contracts
at their convenience, as well as for default based on our failure to meet specified performance requirements. If any of
our U.S. government contracts were to be terminated for convenience, we generally would be entitled to receive
payment for work completed and allowable termination or cancellation costs. If any of our government contracts were to
be terminated for default, generally the U.S. government would pay only for the work that has been accepted and could
require us to pay the difference between the original contract price and the cost to re-procure the contract items, net of
the work accepted from the original contract. The U.S. government can also hold us liable for damages resulting from
the default.
Commercial Aircraft. In the U.S., our commercial aircraft products are required to comply with FAA regulations
governing production and quality systems, airworthiness and installation approvals, repair procedures and continuing
operational safety. Outside the U.S., similar requirements exist for airworthiness, installation and operational approvals.
These requirements are generally administered by the national aviation authorities of each country and, in the case of
Europe, coordinated by the European Joint Aviation Authorities.
Environmental. We are subject to various federal, state, local and non-U.S. laws and regulations relating to
environmental protection, including the discharge, treatment, storage, disposal and remediation of hazardous
substances and wastes. We continually assess our compliance status and management of environmental matters to
ensure our operations are in compliance with all applicable environmental laws and regulations. Investigation,
remediation, and operation and maintenance costs associated with environmental compliance and management of
sites are a normal, recurring part of our operations. These costs often are allowable costs under our contracts with the
U.S. government. It is reasonably possible that costs incurred to ensure continued environmental compliance could
have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows if additional work requirements or
more stringent clean-up standards are imposed by regulators, new areas of soil, air and groundwater contamination are
discovered and/or expansions of work scope are prompted by the results of investigations.
A Potentially Responsible Party (PRP) has joint and several liability under existing U.S. environmental laws. Where we
have been designated a PRP by the Environmental Protection Agency or a state environmental agency, we are
potentially liable to the government or third parties for the full cost of remediating contamination at our facilities or
former facilities or at third-party sites. If we were required to fully fund the remediation of a site for which we were
originally assigned a partial share, the statutory
3
Table of Contents
framework would allow us to pursue rights to contribution from other PRPs. For additional information relating to
environmental contingencies, see Note 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
Non-U.S. Sales. Our non-U.S. sales are subject to both U.S. and non-U.S. governmental regulations and procurement
policies and practices, including regulations relating to import-export control, tariffs, investment, exchange controls,
anti-corruption, and repatriation of earnings. Non-U.S. sales are also subject to varying currency, political and economic
risks.
Raw Materials, Parts, and Subassemblies
We are highly dependent on the availability of essential materials, parts and subassemblies from our suppliers and
subcontractors. The most important raw materials required for our aerospace products are aluminum (sheet, plate,
forgings and extrusions), titanium (sheet, plate, forgings and extrusions) and composites (including carbon and boron).
Although alternative sources generally exist for these raw materials, qualification of the sources could take a year or
more. Many major components and product equipment items are procured or subcontracted on a sole-source basis
with a number of companies.
Suppliers
We are dependent upon the ability of a large number of U.S. and non-U.S. suppliers and subcontractors to meet
performance specifications, quality standards and delivery schedules at our anticipated costs. While we maintain an
extensive qualification and performance surveillance system to control risk associated with such reliance on third
parties, failure of suppliers or subcontractors to meet commitments could adversely affect production schedules and
program/contract profitability, thereby jeopardizing our ability to fulfill commitments to our customers. We are also
dependent on the availability of energy sources, such as electricity, at affordable prices.
Seasonality
No material portion of our business is considered to be seasonal.

Forward-Looking Statements
This report, as well as our annual report to shareholders, quarterly reports, and other filings we make with the SEC,
press and earnings releases and other written and oral communications, contain “forward-looking statements” within
the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Words such as “may,” “should,” “expects,”
“intends,” “projects,” “plans,” “believes,” “estimates,” “targets,” “anticipates” and similar expressions generally identify
these forward-looking statements. Examples of forward-looking statements include statements relating to our future
financial condition and operating results, as well as any other statement that does not directly relate to any historical or
current fact.
Forward-looking statements are based on expectations and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable when made,
but that may not prove to be accurate. These statements are not guarantees and are subject to risks, uncertainties and
changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict. Many factors, including those set forth in the “Risk Factors”
section below and other important factors disclosed in this report and from time to time in our other filings with the SEC,
could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from these forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking
statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made, and we assume no obligation to update or revise any
forward-looking statement whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by
law.
Item 1A. Risk Factors
An investment in our common stock or debt securities involves risks and uncertainties and our actual results and future
trends may differ materially from our past or projected future performance. We urge investors to consider carefully the
risk factors described below in evaluating the information contained in this report.
The 737 MAX fleet is currently grounded, and we have temporarily suspended production of the 737 MAX. We
are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties related to the 737 MAX. These risks include uncertainties
regarding the timing and conditions of 737 MAX regulatory approvals, delays in the resumption of production,
lower than planned production rates and/or delivery rates, increased considerations to customers, increased
supplier costs and supply chain health, changes to the assumptions and estimates made in our financial
statements regarding the 737 program, and potential outcomes of various 737 MAX-related legal proceedings
and government investigations.
On March 13, 2019, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued an order to suspend operations of all 737 MAX
aircraft in the U.S. and by U.S. aircraft operators following two fatal 737 MAX accidents. Non-U.S. civil aviation
authorities have issued directives to the same effect. Deliveries of the 737 MAX have been suspended until clearance
is granted by the appropriate regulatory authorities. The grounding has reduced revenues, operating margins, and cash
flows, and will continue to do so until production and deliveries resume and production rates return to pre-grounding
levels. In connection with the effort to return the 737 MAX to service, we have developed software updates for the 737
MAX, together with an associated pilot training and supplementary education program. We continue to work with the
FAA and other non-U.S. civil aviation authorities to complete remaining steps toward certification and readiness for
return to service, including addressing their questions on the software updates and how pilots will interact with the
airplane controls and displays in different flight scenarios. Any delays in certification and/or the resumption of deliveries
or other liabilities associated with the accidents or grounding could have a material adverse effect on our financial
position, results of operations, and/or cash flows. In addition, multiple legal actions have been filed against us related to
the 737 MAX. We also are fully cooperating with U.S. government investigations related to the accidents and the 737
MAX, including investigations by the U.S. Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission. Any
adverse results with respect to any such litigation or investigation could have a further material impact on our financial
position, results of operations and/or cash flows.

Table of Contents
During the second quarter of 2019, we announced plans to reduce the 737 production rate from 52 aircraft per month to
42 per month. During the fourth quarter of 2019, we announced plans to temporarily suspend 737 MAX production
beginning in January 2020. Impacts related to the reduction in production rate followed by the production suspension
have significantly increased costs to produce aircraft included in the current accounting quantity and will result in
reduced 737 program and overall BCA segment operating margins when deliveries resume. We have also made
significant assumptions regarding estimated costs expected to be incurred in 2020 and 2021 that should be included in
program inventory and those estimated costs that will be expensed when incurred as abnormal production costs. If we
are unable to return the 737 MAX aircraft to service in one or more jurisdictions or begin deliveries to customers on the
schedule and/or at a pace consistent with our current expectations, we will incur significant additional costs and/or
delay the resumption and subsequent ramp-up of 737 production. These delays would also result in significant
additional disruption to the 737 production system once production resumes and would further delay efforts to restore
and/or implement previously planned increases in the 737 production rate. Cash flows continue to be negatively
impacted by delayed payments from customers, higher costs and inventory levels, and payments made to customers in
connection with disruption to their operations. In addition, we have experienced claims and assertions from customers
in connection with the grounding, and we recorded an earnings charge of $8,259 million, net of insurance recoveries of
$500 million, in 2019, in connection with an estimate of potential concessions and other considerations to customers for
disruptions related to the grounding and associated delivery delays.
Any further delays in regulatory approval of the 737 MAX, the resumption of 737 production and/or deliveries, further
disruptions to suppliers and/or the long-term health of the production system, supplier claims or assertions, or changes
to estimated concessions or other considerations we expect to provide to customers could have a material adverse
effect on our financial position, results of operations, and/or cash flows. The FAA and other non-U.S. civil aviation
authorities will determine the timing and conditions of return to service in each relevant jurisdiction. We have assumed
that regulatory approval will enable 737 MAX deliveries to resume during mid-2020. This assumption reflects our best
estimate at this time based on factors such as the estimated duration of regulatory approval and final pilot training
requirements. In the event of unanticipated additional training requirements in one or more jurisdictions, delays in
regulatory approval, and/or delays in our ability to resume deliveries, we may be required to take actions with longer-
term impact, such as further changes to our production plans, employment reductions and/or the expenditure of
significant resources to support our supply chain and/or customers.
We have made significant estimates with respect to the 737 program regarding the number of units to be produced, the
period during which those units are likely to be produced, and the units’ expected sales prices, production costs,
program tooling and other non-recurring costs, and routine warranty costs. In addition to the estimated timing of the
resumption of deliveries, we have made assumptions regarding outcomes of accident investigations and other
government inquiries, timing of future 737 production rate increases, timing and sequence of future deliveries, supply
chain health as we implement our production plans, as well as outcomes of negotiations with customers. Any changes
in these estimates and/or assumptions with respect to the 737 program could have a material impact on our financial
position, results of operations, and/or cash flows. For additional information, see our discussion under “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis-Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates-737 MAX Grounding” on page 45.
Our Commercial Airplanes and Global Services businesses depend heavily on commercial airlines, and are
subject to unique risks.
Market conditions have a significant impact on demand for our commercial aircraft and related services. The
commercial aircraft market is predominantly driven by long-term trends in airline passenger and cargo traffic. The
principal factors underlying long-term traffic growth are sustained economic growth and political stability both in
developed and emerging markets. Demand for our commercial aircraft is further influenced by airline profitability,
availability of aircraft financing, world trade policies, government-to-government relations, technological advances, price
and other competitive factors, fuel prices, terrorism, epidemics
6
Table of Contents
and environmental regulations. Traditionally, the airline industry has been cyclical and very competitive and has
experienced significant profit swings and constant challenges to be more cost competitive. Significant deterioration in
the global economic environment, the airline industry generally, or the financial stability of one or more of our major
customers could result in fewer new orders for aircraft or services, or could cause customers to seek to postpone or
cancel contractual orders and/or payments to us, which could result in lower revenues, profitability and cash flows and
a reduction in our contractual backlog. In addition, because our commercial aircraft backlog consists of aircraft
scheduled for delivery over a period of several years, any of these macroeconomic, industry or customer impacts could
unexpectedly affect deliveries over a long period.
We enter into firm fixed-price aircraft sales contracts with indexed price escalation clauses which could subject us to
losses if we have cost overruns or if increases in our costs exceed the applicable escalation rate. Commercial aircraft
sales contracts are often entered into years before the aircraft are delivered. In order to help account for economic
fluctuations between the contract date and delivery date, aircraft pricing generally consists of a fixed amount as
modified by price escalation formulas derived from labor, commodity and other price indices. Our revenue estimates
are based on current expectations with respect to these escalation formulas, but the actual escalation amounts are
outside of our control. Escalation factors can fluctuate significantly from period to period. Changes in escalation
amounts can significantly impact revenues and operating margins in our Commercial Airplanes business.
We derive a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of commercial airlines. We can make no
assurance that any customer will exercise purchase options, fulfill existing purchase commitments or purchase
additional products or services from us. In addition, fleet decisions, airline consolidations or financial challenges
involving any of our major commercial airline customers could significantly reduce our revenues and limit our
opportunity to generate profits from those customers.
Our Commercial Airplanes business depends on our ability to maintain a healthy production system, achieve
planned production rate targets, successfully develop new aircraft or new derivative aircraft, and meet or
exceed stringent performance and reliability standards.
The commercial aircraft business is extremely complex, involving extensive coordination and integration with U.S and
non-U.S. suppliers, highly-skilled labor from thousands of employees and other partners, and stringent regulatory
requirements and performance and reliability standards. In addition, the introduction of new aircraft programs and/or
derivatives, such as the 777X, involves increased risks associated with meeting development, testing, production, and
certification schedules. The 737 program has also experienced significant disruption due to the grounding of the 737
MAX and associated suspension of 737 MAX production. As a result, our ability to deliver aircraft on time, satisfy
regulatory and customer requirements, and achieve or maintain, as applicable, program profitability is subject to
significant risks.
We must minimize disruption caused by production changes and achieve productivity improvements in order to meet
customer demand and maintain our profitability. We have plans to adjust production rates on several of our commercial
aircraft programs, as well as to resume 737 MAX production at low levels once timing and conditions of return to
service are better understood. At the same time we are engaging in significant ongoing development, testing and
production of the 777X aircraft. In addition, we continue to seek opportunities to reduce the costs of building our
aircraft, including working with our suppliers to reduce supplier costs, identifying and implementing productivity
improvements, and optimizing how we manage inventory. If production rate changes at any of our commercial aircraft
assembly facilities are delayed or create significant disruption to our production system, or if our suppliers cannot timely
deliver components to us at the cost and rates necessary to achieve our targets, we may be unable to meet delivery
schedules and/or the financial performance of one or more of our programs may suffer.
Operational challenges impacting the production system for one or more of our commercial aircraft programs could
result in production delays and/or failure to meet customer demand for new aircraft, either
7

of which would negatively impact our revenues and operating margins. Our commercial aircraft production system is
extremely complex. Operational issues, including delays or defects in supplier components, failure to meet internal
performance plans, or delays or failures to achieve required regulatory approval, such as the with the 737 MAX, could
result in significant out-of-sequence work and increased production costs, as well as delayed deliveries to customers,
impacts to aircraft performance and/or increased warranty or fleet support costs.
If our commercial airplanes fail to satisfy performance and reliability requirements, we could face additional costs
and/or lower revenues. Developing and manufacturing commercial aircraft that meet or exceed our performance and
reliability standards, as well as those of customers and regulatory agencies, can be costly and technologically
challenging. These challenges are particularly significant with newer aircraft programs. Any failure of any Boeing
aircraft to satisfy performance or reliability requirements could result in disruption to our operations, higher costs and/or
lower revenues.
Changes in levels of U.S. government defense spending or overall acquisition priorities could negatively
impact our financial position and results of operations.
We derive a substantial portion of our revenue from the U.S. government, primarily from defense related programs with
the U.S. DoD. Levels of U.S. defense spending are very difficult to predict and may be impacted by numerous factors
such as the evolving nature of the national security threat, U.S. foreign policy, the domestic political environment,
macroeconomic conditions and the ability of the U.S. government to enact relevant legislation such as authorization
and appropriations bills.
The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019 raised preexisting spending limits on federal discretionary defense and non-defense
spending for fiscal years 2020 and 2021 (FY20 and FY21), reducing budget uncertainty and the risk of sequestration.
Although FY20 appropriations have been enacted and FY21 topline funding levels have been agreed to, the timeliness
of FY21 and future appropriations for government departments and agencies remains a recurrent risk. A lapse in
appropriations for government department or agencies would result in a full or partial government shutdown, which
could impact the Company’s operations. Alternatively, Congress may fund government departments and agencies with
one or more Continuing Resolutions; however, this could restrict the execution of certain program activities and delay
new programs or competitions. In addition, long-term uncertainty remains with respect to overall levels of defense
spending beyond FY21 and it is likely that the U.S. government discretionary spending levels will continue to be subject
to pressure.
In addition, there continues to be uncertainty with respect to future acquisition priorities and program-level
appropriations for the U.S. DoD and other government agencies (including NASA), including tension between
modernization and sustainment investments, within the overall budgetary framework described above. Future budget
cuts or investment priority changes, including changes associated with the authorizations and appropriations process
could result in reductions, cancellations, and/or delays of existing contracts or programs. Any of these impacts could
have a material effect on the results of the Company’s operations, financial position and/or cash flows.
In addition, as a result of the significant ongoing uncertainty with respect to both U.S. defense spending levels and the
nature of the threat environment, we also expect the U.S. DoD to continue to emphasize affordability, innovation,
cybersecurity, and delivery of technical data and software in its procurement processes. If we can no longer adjust
successfully to these changing acquisition policies our revenues and market share could be impacted.

We conduct a significant portion of our business pursuant to U.S. government contracts, which are subject to
unique risks.
In 2019, 39% of our revenues were earned pursuant to U.S. government contracts, which include foreign military sales
(FMS) through the U.S. government. Business conducted pursuant to such contracts is subject to extensive
procurement regulations and other unique risks.
Our sales to the U.S. government are subject to extensive procurement regulations, and changes to those regulations
could increase our costs. New procurement regulations, or changes to existing requirements, could increase our
compliance costs or otherwise have a material impact on the operating margins of our BDS and BGS businesses.
These requirements may result in increased compliance costs, and we could be subject to additional costs in the form
of withheld payments and/or reduced future business if we fail to comply with these requirements in the future.
Compliance costs attributable to current and potential future procurement regulations such as these could negatively
impact our financial condition and operating results.
The U.S. government may modify, curtail or terminate one or more of our contracts. The U.S. government contracting
party may modify, curtail or terminate its contracts and subcontracts with us, without prior notice and either at its
convenience or for default based on performance. In addition, funding pursuant to our U.S. government contracts may
be reduced or withheld as part of the U.S. Congressional appropriations process due to fiscal constraints, changes in
U.S. national security strategy and/or priorities or other reasons. Further uncertainty with respect to ongoing programs
could also result in the event that the U.S. government finances its operations through temporary funding measures
such as “continuing resolutions” rather than full-year appropriations. Any loss or anticipated loss or reduction of
expected funding and/or modification, curtailment, or termination of one or more large programs could have a material
adverse effect on our earnings, cash flow and/or financial position.
We are subject to U.S. government inquiries and investigations, including periodic audits of costs that we determine are
reimbursable under U.S. government contracts. U.S. government agencies, including the Defense Contract Audit
Agency and the Defense Contract Management Agency, routinely audit government contractors. These agencies
review our performance under contracts, cost structure and compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and
standards, as well as the adequacy of and our compliance with our internal control systems and policies. Any costs
found to be misclassified or inaccurately allocated to a specific contract will be deemed non-reimbursable, and to the
extent already reimbursed, must be refunded. Any inadequacies in our systems and policies could result in withholds
on billed receivables, penalties and reduced future business. Furthermore, if any audit, inquiry or investigation uncovers
improper or illegal activities, we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including
termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines, and suspension or debarment from doing
business with the U.S. government. We also could suffer reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made
against us, even if such allegations are later determined to be false.
We enter into fixed-price contracts which could subject us to losses if we have cost overruns.
Our BDS and BGS defense businesses generated approximately 70% and 73% of their 2019 revenues from fixed-price
contracts. While fixed-price contracts enable us to benefit from performance improvements, cost reductions and
efficiencies, they also subject us to the risk of reduced margins or incurring losses if we are unable to achieve
estimated costs and revenues. If our estimated costs exceed our estimated price, we recognize reach-forward losses
which can significantly affect our reported results. For example, in 2019, we recorded reach-forward losses of $489
million on the Commercial Crew contract primarily reflecting higher estimated costs associated with spacecraft
completion, certification and testing, and additional reach-forward losses of $148 million on the KC-46A Tanker contract
reflecting higher manufacturing costs. New programs could also have risk for reach-forward loss upon contract award
and during the period of contract performance. For example, in 2018, in connection with winning the T-7A Red
9
Table of Contents
Hawk and MQ-25 competitions, we recorded a loss of $400 million associated with options for 346 T-7A Red Hawk
aircraft and a loss of $291 million related to the MQ-25 Engineering, Manufacturing and Development (EMD) contract.
The long term nature of many of our contracts makes the process of estimating costs and revenues on fixed-price
contracts inherently risky. Fixed-price contracts often contain price incentives and penalties tied to performance which
can be difficult to estimate and have significant impacts on margins. In addition, some of our contracts have specific
provisions relating to cost, schedule and performance.
Fixed-price development contracts are generally subject to more uncertainty than fixed-price production contracts.
Many of these development programs have highly complex designs. In addition, technical or quality issues that arise
during development could lead to schedule delays and higher costs to complete, which could result in a material charge
or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition. Examples of significant BDS fixed-price development contracts
include Commercial Crew, KC-46A Tanker, T-7A Red Hawk, VC-25B Presidential Aircraft, MQ-25, and commercial and
military satellites.
We enter into cost-type contracts which also carry risks.
Our BDS and BGS defense businesses generated approximately 30% and 27% of their 2019 revenues from cost-type
contracting arrangements. Some of these are development programs that have complex design and technical
challenges. These cost-type programs typically have award or incentive fees that are subject to uncertainty and may be
earned over extended periods. In these cases the associated financial risks are primarily in reduced fees, lower profit
rates or program cancellation if cost, schedule or technical performance issues arise. Programs whose contracts are
primarily cost-type include Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD), Proprietary and SLS programs.
We enter into contracts that include in-orbit incentive payments that subject us to risks.
Contracts in the commercial satellite industry and certain government satellite contracts include in-orbit incentive
payments. These in-orbit payments may be paid over time after final satellite acceptance or paid in full prior to final
satellite acceptance. In both cases, the in-orbit incentive payment is at risk if the satellite does not perform to
specifications for up to 15 years after acceptance. The net present value of in-orbit incentive fees we ultimately expect
to realize is recognized as revenue in the construction period. If the satellite fails to meet contractual performance
criteria, customers will not be obligated to continue making in-orbit payments and/or we may be required to provide
refunds to the customer and incur significant charges.
Our ability to deliver products and services that satisfy customer requirements is heavily dependent on the
performance and financial stability of our subcontractors and suppliers, as well as on the availability of raw
materials and other components.
We rely on other companies including U.S. and non-U.S. subcontractors and suppliers to provide and produce raw
materials, integrated components and sub-assemblies, and production commodities and to perform some of the
services that we provide to our customers. If one or more of our suppliers or subcontractors experiences financial
difficulties, delivery delays or other performance problems, we may be unable to meet commitments to our customers
or incur additional costs. In addition, if one or more of the raw materials on which we depend (such as aluminum,
titanium or composites) becomes unavailable or is available only at very high prices, we may be unable to deliver one
or more of our products in a timely fashion or at budgeted costs. In some instances, we depend upon a single source of
supply. Any service disruption from one of these suppliers, either due to circumstances beyond the supplier’s control,
such as geo-political developments, or as a result of performance problems or financial difficulties, could have a
material adverse effect on our ability to meet commitments to our customers or increase our operating costs.

We use estimates in accounting for many contracts and programs. Changes in our estimates could adversely
affect our future financial results.
Contract and program accounting require judgment relative to assessing risks, estimating revenues and costs and
making assumptions for schedule and technical issues. Due to the size and nature of many of our contracts and
programs, the estimation of total revenues and cost at completion is complicated and subject to many variables.
Assumptions have to be made regarding the length of time to complete the contract or program because costs also
include expected increases in wages and employee benefits, material prices and allocated fixed costs. Incentives or
penalties related to performance on contracts are considered in estimating sales and profit rates, and are recorded
when there is sufficient information for us to assess anticipated performance. Supplier claims and assertions are also
assessed and considered in estimating costs and profit rates. Estimates of award fees are also used in sales and profit
rates based on actual and anticipated awards.
With respect to each of our commercial aircraft programs, inventoriable production costs (including overhead), program
tooling and other non-recurring costs and routine warranty costs are accumulated and charged as cost of sales by
program instead of by individual units or contracts. A program consists of the estimated number of units (accounting
quantity) of a product to be produced in a continuing, long-term production effort for delivery under existing and
anticipated contracts limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates. To establish the relationship of
sales to cost of sales, program accounting requires estimates of (a) the number of units to be produced and sold in a
program, (b) the period over which the units can reasonably be expected to be produced and (c) the units’ expected
sales prices, production costs, program tooling and other non-recurring costs, and routine warranty costs for the total
program. Several factors determine accounting quantity, including firm orders, letters of intent from prospective
customers and market studies. Changes to customer or model mix, production costs and rates, learning curve,
changes to price escalation indices, costs of derivative aircraft, supplier performance, customer and supplier
negotiations/settlements, supplier claims and/or certification issues can impact these estimates. Any such change in
estimates relating to program accounting may adversely affect future financial performance.
Because of the significance of the judgments and estimation processes described above, materially different sales and
profit amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change.
Changes in underlying assumptions, circumstances or estimates may adversely affect future period financial
performance. For additional information on our accounting policies for recognizing sales and profits, see our discussion
under “Management’s Discussion and Analysis – Critical Accounting Policies – Contract Accounting/Program
Accounting” on pages 44 – 45 and Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 57 – 69 of this Form 10-
K.
Competition within our markets and with respect to the products we sell may reduce our future contracts and
sales.
The markets in which we operate are highly competitive and one or more of our competitors may have more extensive
or more specialized engineering, manufacturing and marketing capabilities than we do in some areas. In our
Commercial Airplanes business, we anticipate increasing competition among non-U.S. aircraft manufacturers of
commercial jet aircraft. In our BDS business, we anticipate that the effects of defense industry consolidation, fewer
large and new programs and new priorities, including near and long-term cost competitiveness, of our U.S. DoD and
non-U.S. customers will intensify competition for many of our BDS products. Our BGS segment faces competition from
many of the same strong U.S. and non-U.S. competitors facing BCA and BDS. Furthermore, we are facing increased
international competition and cross-border consolidation of competition. There can be no assurance that we will be able
to compete successfully against our current or future competitors or that the competitive pressures we face will not
result in reduced revenues and market share.
11
Table of Contents
We derive a significant portion of our revenues from non-U.S. sales and are subject to the risks of doing
business in other countries.
In 2019, non-U.S. customers, which includes FMS, accounted for approximately 55% of our revenues. We expect that
non-U.S. sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future. As a result,
we are subject to risks of doing business internationally, including:
• changes in regulatory requirements;
• U.S. and non-U.S. government policies, including requirements to expend a portion of program funds locally
and governmental industrial cooperation or participation requirements;
• fluctuations in international currency exchange rates;
• volatility in international political and economic environments and changes in non-U.S. national priorities and
budgets, which can lead to delays or fluctuations in orders;
• the complexity and necessity of using non-U.S. representatives and consultants;
• the uncertainty of the ability of non-U.S. customers to finance purchases, including the availability of financing
from the Export-Import Bank of the United States;
• uncertainties and restrictions concerning the availability of funding credit or guarantees;
• imposition of domestic and international taxes, export controls, tariffs, embargoes, sanctions and other trade
restrictions;
• the difficulty of management and operation of an enterprise spread over many countries;
• compliance with a variety of non-U.S. laws, as well as U.S. laws affecting the activities of U.S. companies
abroad; and
• unforeseen developments and conditions, including terrorism, war, epidemics and international tensions and
conflicts.
While the impact of these factors is difficult to predict, any one or more of these factors could adversely affect our
operations in the future.
Unauthorized access to our or our customers’ information and systems could negatively impact our business.
We face certain security threats, including threats to the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data and
systems. We maintain an extensive network of technical security controls, policy enforcement mechanisms, monitoring
systems and management oversight in order to address these threats. While these measures are designed to prevent,
detect and respond to unauthorized activity in our systems, certain types of attacks, including cyber-attacks, could
result in significant financial or information losses and/or reputational harm. In addition, we manage information and
information technology systems for certain customers. Many of these customers face similar security threats. If we
cannot prevent the unauthorized access, release and/or corruption of our customers’ confidential, classified or
personally identifiable information, our reputation could be damaged, and/or we could face financial losses.
The outcome of litigation and of government inquiries and investigations involving our business is
unpredictable and an adverse decision in any such matter could have a material effect on our financial
position and results of operations.
We are involved in a number of litigation matters. These matters may divert financial and management resources that
would otherwise be used to benefit our operations. No assurances can be given that the results of these matters will be
favorable to us. An adverse resolution of any of these lawsuits, or future lawsuits, could have a material impact on our
financial position and results of operations. In addition, we
12
Table of Contents
are subject to extensive regulation under the laws of the United States and its various states, as well as other
jurisdictions in which we operate. As a result, we are sometimes subject to government inquiries and investigations of
our business due, among other things, to our business relationships with the U.S. government, the heavily regulated
nature of our industry, and in the case of environmental proceedings, our current or past ownership of certain property.
Any such inquiry or investigation could potentially result in an adverse ruling against us, which could have a material
impact on our financial position and results of operations.
A significant portion of our customer financing portfolio is concentrated among certain customers and in
certain types of Boeing aircraft, which exposes us to concentration risks.
A significant portion of our customer financing portfolio is concentrated among certain customers and in distinct
geographic regions. Our portfolio is also concentrated by varying degrees across Boeing aircraft product types, most
notably 717 and 747-8 aircraft, and among customers that we believe have less than investment-grade credit. If one or
more customers holding a significant portion of our portfolio assets experiences financial difficulties or otherwise
defaults on or does not renew its leases with us at their expiration, and we are unable to redeploy the aircraft on
reasonable terms, or if the types of aircraft that are concentrated in our portfolio suffer greater than expected declines
in value, our earnings, cash flows and/or financial position could be materially adversely affected.
We may be unable to obtain debt to fund our operations and contractual commitments at competitive rates, on
commercially reasonable terms or in sufficient amounts.
We depend, in part, upon the issuance of debt to fund our operations and contractual commitments. As of December
31, 2019 and 2018, our airplane financing commitments totaled $13,377 and $19,462. In addition, our debt balances
increased significantly in 2019, and we expect further increases in 2020, in order to manage liquidity impacts related to
the 737 MAX grounding. This has also resulted in downgrades to our credit ratings. If we require additional funding in
order to fund outstanding financing commitments, address further 737 MAX impacts, or meet other business
requirements, our market liquidity may not be sufficient. A number of factors could cause us to incur increased
borrowing costs and to have greater difficulty accessing public and private markets for debt. These factors include
disruptions or declines in the global capital markets and/or a decline in our financial performance, outlook or credit
ratings, including impacts related to the 737 MAX grounding The occurrence of any or all of these events may
adversely affect our ability to fund our operations and contractual or financing commitments.
We may not realize the anticipated benefits of mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures/strategic alliances or
divestitures.
As part of our business strategy, we may merge with or acquire businesses and/or form joint ventures and strategic
alliances. For example, in 2018 we completed the acquisition of KLX Inc., a provider of aviation parts and services.
Whether we realize the anticipated benefits from these acquisitions and related activities depends, in part, upon our
ability to integrate the operations of the acquired business, the performance of the underlying product and service
portfolio, and the performance of the management team and other personnel of the acquired operations. Accordingly,
our financial results could be adversely affected by unanticipated performance issues, legacy liabilities, transaction-
related charges, amortization of expenses related to intangibles, charges for impairment of long-term assets, credit
guarantees, partner performance and indemnifications. Consolidations of joint ventures could also impact our reported
results of operations or financial position. While we believe that we have established appropriate and adequate
procedures and processes to mitigate these risks, there is no assurance that these transactions will be successful. We
also may make strategic divestitures from time to time. These transactions may result in continued financial
involvement in the divested businesses, such as through guarantees or other financial arrangements,
13
Table of Contents
following the transaction. Nonperformance by those divested businesses could affect our future financial results
through additional payment obligations, higher costs or asset write-downs.
Our insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all significant risk exposures.
We are exposed to liabilities that are unique to the products and services we provide. We maintain insurance for certain
risks and, in some circumstances, we may receive indemnification from the U.S. government. The amount of our
insurance coverage may not cover all claims or liabilities and we may be forced to bear substantial costs. For example,
liabilities arising from the use of certain of our products, such as aircraft technologies, missile systems, border security
systems, anti-terrorism technologies, and/or air traffic management systems may not be insurable on commercially
reasonable terms. While some of these products are shielded from liability within the U.S. under the SAFETY Act
provisions of the 2002 Homeland Security Act, no such protection is available outside the U.S., potentially resulting in
significant liabilities. The amount of insurance coverage we maintain may be inadequate to cover these or other claims
or liabilities.
Business disruptions could seriously affect our future sales and financial condition or increase our costs and
expenses.
Our business may be impacted by disruptions including threats to physical security, information technology or cyber-
attacks or failures, damaging weather or other acts of nature and pandemics or other public health crises. Any of these
disruptions could affect our internal operations or our ability to deliver products and services to our customers. Any
significant production delays, or any destruction, manipulation or improper use of our data, information systems or
networks could impact our sales, increase our expenses and/or have an adverse effect on the reputation of Boeing and
of our products and services.
Some of our and our suppliers’ workforces are represented by labor unions, which may lead to work
stoppages.
Approximately 57,000 employees, which constitute 35% of our total workforce, were union represented as of December
31, 2019. We experienced a work stoppage in 2008 when a labor strike halted commercial aircraft and certain BDS
program production. We may experience additional work stoppages in the future, which could adversely affect our
business. We cannot predict how stable our relationships, currently with 11 U.S. labor organizations and 13 non-U.S.
labor organizations, will be or whether we will be able to meet the unions’ requirements without impacting our financial
condition. The unions may also limit our flexibility in dealing with our workforce. Union actions at suppliers can also
affect us. Work stoppages and instability in our union relationships could delay the production and/or development of
our products, which could strain relationships with customers and cause a loss of revenues which would adversely
affect our operations.
Substantial pension and other postretirement benefit obligations have a material impact on our earnings,
shareholders’ equity and cash flows from operations, and could have significant adverse impacts in future
periods.
The majority of our employees have earned benefits under defined benefit pension plans. Potential pension
contributions include both mandatory amounts required under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act and
discretionary contributions to improve the plans' funded status. The extent of future contributions depends heavily on
market factors such as the discount rate and the actual return on plan assets. We estimate future contributions to these
plans using assumptions with respect to these and other items. Changes to those assumptions could have a significant
effect on future contributions as well as on our annual pension costs and/or result in a significant change to
shareholders' equity. For U.S. government contracts, we allocate pension costs to individual contracts based on U.S.
Cost Accounting Standards
14
Table of Contents
which can also affect contract profitability. We also provide other postretirement benefits to certain of our employees,
consisting principally of health care coverage for eligible retirees and qualifying dependents. Our estimates of future
costs associated with these benefits are also subject to assumptions, including estimates of the level of medical cost
increases. For a discussion regarding how our financial statements can be affected by pension and other
postretirement plan accounting policies, see “Management's Discussion and Analysis-Critical Accounting Policies-
Pension Plans” on page 48 of this Form 10-K. Although Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States
of America (GAAP) expense and pension or other postretirement benefit contributions are not directly related, the key
economic factors that affect GAAP expense would also likely affect the amount of cash or stock we would contribute to
our plans.
Our operations expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities.
We are subject to various U.S. federal, state, local and non-U.S. laws and regulations related to environmental
protection, including the discharge, treatment, storage, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and wastes.
We could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, as well as third-party
claims for property damage or personal injury, if we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws or
regulations. In some cases, we may be subject to such costs due to environmental impacts attributable to our current or
past manufacturing operations or the operations of companies we have acquired. In other cases, we may become
subject to such costs due to an indemnification agreement between us and a third party relating to such environmental
liabilities. In addition, new laws and regulations, more stringent enforcement of existing laws and regulations, the
discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new remediation requirements could result in
additional costs. For additional information relating to environmental contingencies, see Note 14 to our Consolidated
Financial Statements.

Consolidated Results of Operations and Financial Condition
Overview
We are a global market leader in the design, development, manufacture, sale, service and support of commercial
jetliners, military aircraft, satellites, missile defense, human space flight and launch systems and services. We are one
of the two major manufacturers of 100+ seat airplanes for the worldwide commercial airline industry and one of the
largest defense contractors in the U.S. While our principal operations are in the U.S., we conduct operations in an
expanding number of countries and rely on an extensive network of non-U.S. partners, key suppliers and
subcontractors.
Our strategy is centered on successful execution in healthy core businesses – Commercial Airplanes (BCA), Defense,
Space & Security (BDS), and Global Services (BGS) – supplemented and supported by Boeing Capital (BCC). Taken
together, these core businesses have historically generated substantial earnings and cash flow that permit us to invest
in new products and services. We focus on producing the products and providing the services that the market
demands, and continue to find new ways to improve efficiency and quality to provide a fair return for our shareholders.
BCA is committed to being the leader in commercial aviation by offering airplanes and services that deliver superior
design, safety, efficiency and value to customers around the world. BDS integrates its resources in defense,
intelligence, communications, security, space and services to deliver capability-driven solutions to customers at
reduced costs. Our BDS strategy is to leverage our core businesses to capture key next-generation programs while
expanding our presence in adjacent and international markets, underscored by an intense focus on growth and
productivity. BGS provides support for commercial and defense through innovative, comprehensive, and cost-
competitive product and service solutions. BCC facilitates, arranges, structures and provides selective financing
solutions for our Boeing customers.
On March 13, 2019, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued an order to suspend operations of all 737 MAX
aircraft in the U.S. and by U.S. aircraft operators following two fatal 737 MAX accidents. Non-U.S. civil aviation
authorities have issued directives to the same effect. Deliveries of the 737 MAX have been suspended until clearance
is granted by the appropriate regulatory authorities. The grounding is having a significant adverse impact on our
operations and creates significant uncertainty. We are focused on safely returning the 737 MAX to service.

Unallocated items, eliminations and other (635) (94) 537
Total $76,559 $101,127 $94,005
Revenues decreased by $24,568 million in 2019 compared with 2018 primarily due to lower revenues at BCA, partially
offset by higher revenues at BGS. Lower BCA revenues are primarily driven by lower 737 MAX deliveries and a
revenue reduction of $8,259 million recorded in 2019 for estimated potential concessions and other considerations to
customers for disruptions and associated delivery delays related to the 737 MAX grounding, net of insurance
recoveries.
Revenues increased by $7,122 million in 2018 compared with 2017 due to higher revenues at BCA, BDS, and BGS.
BCA revenues increased by $2,887 million due to higher 737 and 787 deliveries and favorable 737 and 787 model mix,
which more than offset lower 777 and 747 deliveries. BDS revenues increased by $2,454 million primarily due to non-
US contract awards for fighters, higher weapons revenue, the final C-17 aircraft sale and higher satellites revenue.
BGS revenues increased by $2,445 million due to higher parts revenue, including the acquisition of KLX, Inc. (KLX) in
the fourth quarter of 2018.

The changes in Unallocated items, eliminations and other in 2019, 2018 and 2017 primarily reflect the timing of
eliminations for intercompany aircraft deliveries and the sale of aircraft previously leased to customers.

Loss from operations was $1,975 million in 2019 compared with earnings from operations of $11,987 million in 2018.
The decrease of $13,962 million is primarily due to a loss from operations at BCA of $6,657 million in 2019 compared to
earnings from operations of $7,830 million in 2018, partially offset by higher earnings at BDS and BGS in 2019
compared with 2018. BCA decreased by $14,487 million due to lower 737 deliveries and the earnings charge for the
737 MAX grounding of $8,259 million, net of insurance recoveries. BDS earnings from operations increased by $951
million primarily due to lower charges in 2019 for development programs. BGS earnings from operations increased by
$161 million primarily due to higher revenues, which was partially offset by less favorable performance and mix.
Earnings from operations increased by $1,643 million in 2018 compared with 2017 primarily due to higher earnings at
BCA and BGS, which more than offset the decrease at BDS and the change in Unallocated items, eliminations and
other. BCA earnings from operations increased by $2,545 million due to higher revenues and improved operating
margins. The increase in operating margins is primarily due to higher 787 margins, improved cost performance and
favorable delivery mix. BGS earnings from operations increased by $285 million primarily due to higher revenues,
partially offset by higher period costs. BDS earnings from operations decreased by $726 million as earnings growth
from higher revenues was more than offset by charges of $691 million related to winning the T-7A Red Hawk and MQ-
25 competitions, as well as higher KC-46A Tanker reach-forward losses.
During 2019, 2018 and 2017, we recorded reach-forward losses on the KC-46A Tanker program of $148 million, $736
million, and $445 million, respectively.
Core operating earnings decreased by $14,050 million in 2019 compared with 2018 primarily due to a loss from
operations at BCA in 2019, partially offset by higher earnings at BDS and BGS.

Unallocated items, eliminations and other ($2,066) ($1,442) ($1,127)
Deferred compensation expense increased by $155 million in 2019 and decreased by $221 million in 2018, primarily
driven by changes in broad stock market conditions and our stock price.
Research and development expense increased by $252 million in 2019 and increased by $174 million in 2018 primarily
due to spending by Boeing NeXt on product development.
In 2019, we recorded a $250 million charge related to the impairment of lease incentives with one customer that
experienced liquidity issues, and a $109 million charge related to ongoing litigation associated with recoverable costs
on U.S. government contracts. In 2018, we recorded a $148 million charge related to the outcome of the Spirit litigation.
Eliminations and other unallocated expense increased by $20 million in 2019 and $219 million in 2018 primarily due to
timing of expense allocations.
Net periodic pension benefit costs included in Earnings from operations were as follows:
(Dollars in millions) Pension
Years ended December 31, 2019 2018 2017
Allocated to business segments ($1,384)($1,318) ($1,637)
Pension FAS/CAS service cost adjustment 1,071 1,005 1,127
Net periodic benefit cost included in (Loss)/earnings from operations ($313) ($313) ($510)
The pension FAS/CAS service cost adjustment recognized in Earnings from operations in 2019, 2018, and 2017 was
largely consistent across all periods. The net periodic benefit cost included in Earnings from operations in 2019 was
consistent with 2018, as reductions in current year service cost were offset by higher amortization of prior year service
costs. The decrease in net periodic benefit cost included in Earnings from operations in 2018 compared to 2017 was
primarily due to a lower portion of service cost recognized in Earnings from operations.

higher interest income.
The non-operating pension income included in Other income, net was $374 million in 2019, $143 million in 2018, and
$117 million in 2017. The increased income in 2019 compared to 2018 was due to lower amortization of actuarial
losses, partially offset by decreases in expected return on assets and increases in interest cost. The increase in 2018
compared to 2017 was due to decreases in interest cost and increases in estimated return on assets, partially offset by
higher amortization of actuarial losses.
Interest and debt expense increased by $247 million in 2019 and increased by $115 million in 2018 as a result of higher
debt balances.
For additional discussion related to Income Taxes, see Note 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
Total Costs and Expenses (“Cost of Sales”)
Cost of sales, for both products and services, consists primarily of raw materials, parts, sub-assemblies, labor,
overhead and subcontracting costs. Our BCA segment predominantly uses program accounting to account for cost of
sales. Under program accounting, cost of sales for each commercial airplane program equals the product of (i) revenue
recognized in connection with customer deliveries and (ii) the estimated cost of sales percentage applicable to the total
remaining program. For long-term contracts, the amount reported as cost of sales is recognized as incurred.
Substantially all contracts at our BDS segment and certain contracts at our BGS segment are long-term contracts with
the U.S. government and other customers that generally extend over several years. Costs on these contracts are
recorded as incurred. Cost of sales for commercial spare parts is recorded at average cost.
The following table summarizes cost of sales:

Cost of sales decreased by $9,397 million in 2019 compared with 2018, primarily due to lower revenue and lower
reach-forward losses. Cost of sales as a percentage of Revenues increased in 2019 primarily due to the 737 MAX
grounding.
Cost of sales increased by $4,878 million in 2018 compared with 2017, primarily due to higher revenue and higher

Unobligated backlog 26,930 $28,411
Total Backlog $463,403 $490,481
Contractual backlog of unfilled orders excludes purchase options, announced orders for which definitive contracts have
not been executed, and unobligated U.S. and non-U.S. government contract funding. The decrease in contractual
backlog during 2019 was primarily due to BCA deliveries in excess of new orders and a reduction in backlog related to
orders from a customer that experienced liquidity issues, partially offset by BDS current year contract awards in excess
of revenue recognized on contracts awarded in prior years
Unobligated backlog includes U.S. and non-U.S. government definitive contracts for which funding has not been
authorized. The decrease in unobligated backlog in 2019 was primarily due to reclassifications to contractual backlog
related to BDS and BGS contracts partially offset by contract awards.

Global Trade We continually monitor the global trade environment for changes in tariffs, trade agreements, sanctions
or other potential geopolitical economic developments that may impact the company.
Beginning in June 2018, the U.S. Government has imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. In response to these
tariffs, several major U.S. trading partners have imposed, or announced their intention to impose, tariffs on U.S. goods.
In May 2019, the U.S. Government, Mexico and Canada reached an agreement to end the steel and aluminum tariffs
between these countries. Passage of the U.S./Mexico/Canada Free Trade Agreement (USMCA) will also result in lower
tariffs. We continue to monitor the potential for any extra costs that may result from the remaining global tariffs.
Since 2018, the U.S. and China imposed tariffs on approximately $34 billion of each other's exports in July 2018.
Certain aircraft parts and components that Boeing procures are subject to these tariffs. Subsequently, the U.S. imposed
tariffs on an additional $216 billion in Chinese goods, and China imposed tariffs on an additional $76 billion worth of
U.S goods. The U.S. and China Phase I agreement in January 2020 is a positive development for overall trade with
China. Negotiations to resolve remaining trade issues continue.
Overall global trade tensions and increased market uncertainty have resulted in fewer orders than anticipated for our
commercial aircraft.
The U.S. Government continues to impose and/or consider imposing sanctions on certain businesses and individuals in
Russia. Although our operations or sales in Russia have not been impacted to date, we continue to monitor additional
sanctions that may be imposed by the U.S. Government and any responses from Russia that could affect our supply
chain, business partners or customers.

Commercial Airplanes
Business Environment and Trends
Airline Industry Environment Global economic growth, a primary driver for air travel, was 2.6% in 2019, slightly below
the long-term average of approximately 3%. Passenger traffic is estimated to grow by 4% to 5% in 2019, close to the
long-term average of approximately 5%. The grounding of the 737 MAX and suspension of 737 MAX deliveries has
slowed growth at certain airlines. While growth was solid across most major world regions, there continues to be
variation between regions and airline business models. Despite some moderation in the growth rates, airlines operating
in Asia Pacific and Europe, as well as low-cost-carriers globally, are leading the 2019 growth in passenger traffic. Air
cargo traffic growth is expected to contract this year due to weak global trade growth.
Airline financial performance also plays a role in the demand for new capacity. Airlines continue to focus on increasing
revenue through alliances, partnerships, new marketing initiatives, and effective leveraging of ancillary services and
related revenues. Airlines are also focusing on reducing costs and renewing fleets to leverage more efficient airplanes.
Net profits in 2019 are expected to approximate $26 billion.
The long-term outlook for the industry continues to remain positive due to the fundamental drivers of air travel demand:
economic growth and the increasing propensity to travel due to increased trade, globalization, and improved airline
services driven by liberalization of air traffic rights between countries. Our 20-year forecast projects a long-term
average growth rate of 4.6% per year for passenger traffic and 4.2% for cargo traffic. Based on long-term global
economic growth projections of 2.7% average annual GDP growth, we project a $6.8 trillion market for approximately
44,000 new airplanes over the next 20 years. The industry remains vulnerable to exogenous developments including
fuel price spikes, credit market shocks, acts of terrorism, natural disasters, conflicts, epidemics and increased global
environmental regulations.
25
Table of Contents
Industry Competitiveness The commercial jet airplane market and the airline industry remain extremely competitive.
Market liberalization in Europe, the Middle East and Asia is enabling low-cost airlines to continue gaining market share.
These airlines are increasing the pressure on airfares. This results in continued cost pressures for all airlines and price
pressure on our products. Major productivity gains are essential to ensure a favorable market position at acceptable
profit margins.
Continued access to global markets remains vital to our ability to fully realize our sales potential and long-term
investment returns. Approximately 80% of Commercial Airplanes’ total backlog, in dollar terms, is with non-U.S. airlines.
We face aggressive international competitors who are intent on increasing their market share. They offer competitive
products and have access to most of the same customers and suppliers. The grounding of the 737 MAX and the
associated suspension of 737 MAX deliveries have significantly reduced our market share with respect to deliveries of
single aisle aircraft in 2019 and may provide competitors with an opportunity to obtain more orders and increase market
share. We are continuing to monitor the impact of the 737 MAX grounding on our suppliers and working to ensure that
our supply chain can support our production plans once production resumes. With government support, Airbus has
historically invested heavily to create a family of products to compete with ours. After the acquisition of a majority share
of Bombardier’s C Series (now A220) in 2018, Airbus continues to expand in the 100-150 seat transcontinental market.
Additionally, other competitors from Russia, China and Japan are developing commercial jet aircraft. Some of these
competitors have historically enjoyed access to government-provided financial support, including “launch aid,” which
greatly reduces the cost and commercial risks associated with airplane development activities. This has enabled the
development of airplanes without commercial viability; others to be brought to market more quickly than otherwise
possible; and many offered for sale below market-based prices. Many competitors have continued to make
improvements in efficiency, which may result in funding product development, gaining market share and improving
earnings. This market environment has resulted in intense pressures on pricing and other competitive factors, and we
expect these pressures to continue or intensify in the coming years.
We are focused on safely returning the 737 MAX to service, improving our products and services and continuing our
cost-reduction efforts, which enhances our ability to compete. We are also focused on taking actions to ensure that
Boeing is not harmed by unfair subsidization of competitors.

considerations to customers for disruptions and associated delivery delays related to the 737 MAX grounding, net of
$500 million of insurance recoveries. BCA revenues increased by $2,887 million in 2018 compared with 2017 primarily
due to higher 737 and 787 deliveries and favorable 737 and 787 model mix, which more than offset lower 777 and 747
deliveries. The 737 MAX grounding will continue to have a significant impact on revenues until deliveries resume.

Loss/Earnings From Operations
BCA loss from operations was $6,657 million in 2019 compared with earnings from operations of $7,830 million in
2018. The decrease of $14,487 million is primarily due to lower 737 deliveries and earnings charges related to the 737
MAX. The 737 MAX grounding and associated changes to our production rate will continue to adversely impact 737
program and overall BCA margins.
BCA earnings from operations increased by $2,545 million in 2018 compared with 2017. The increase in operating
earnings reflects higher revenues and improved operating margins. The increase in operating margins is primarily due
to higher 787 margins, improved cost performance and favorable delivery mix.

Table of Contents
Backlog
Our total backlog represents the estimated transaction prices on unsatisfied and partially satisfied performance
obligations to our customers where we believe it is probable that we will collect the consideration due and where no
contingencies remain before we and the customer are required to perform. Backlog does not include prospective orders
where customer controlled contingencies remain, such as the customer receiving approval from its board of directors,
shareholders or government or completing financing arrangements. All such contingencies must be satisfied or have
expired prior to recording a new firm order even if satisfying such conditions is highly certain. Backlog excludes options
and BCC orders. A number of our customers may have contractual remedies, including rights to reject individual
airplane deliveries if the actual delivery date is significantly later than the contractual delivery date. We address
customer claims and requests for other contractual relief as they arise. The value of orders in backlog is adjusted as
changes to price and schedule are agreed to with customers and is reported in accordance with the requirements of
ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606).
BCA total backlog of $376,593 million at December 31, 2019 decreased from $408,140 million at December 31, 2018,
primarily due to deliveries in excess of new orders and a reduction in backlog related to orders from a customer that
experienced liquidity issues. We are experiencing fewer new 737 MAX orders than we were receiving prior to the
grounding. If 737 MAX aircraft remain grounded for an extended period of time, we may experience reductions to
backlog and/or significant order cancellations. To date, the 737 MAX grounding has not resulted in significant order
cancellations.
Accounting Quantity The accounting quantity is our estimate of the quantity of airplanes that will be produced for
delivery under existing and anticipated contracts. The determination of the accounting quantity is limited by the ability to
make reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and cost of existing and anticipated contracts. It is a key
determinant of the gross margins we recognize on sales of individual airplanes throughout a program’s life. Estimation
of each program’s accounting quantity takes into account several factors that are indicative of the demand for that
program, including firm orders, letters of intent from prospective customers and market studies. We review our program
accounting quantities quarterly.
The accounting quantity for each program may include units that have been delivered, undelivered units under contract,
and units anticipated to be under contract in the reasonable future (anticipated orders). In developing total program
estimates, all of these items within the accounting quantity must be considered.

Program Highlights
737 Program See the discussion of the 737 MAX Grounding and 737NG Structure (Pickle Fork) in Note 14 to our
Consolidated Financial Statements .
747 Program We are currently producing at a rate of 0.5 aircraft per month. We believe that ending production of the
747 at the end of the current accounting quantity would not have a material impact on our financial position, results of
operations or cash flows.
767 Program The 767 assembly line includes the commercial program and a derivative to support the tanker program.
We are increasing our combined production rate from 2.5 to 3 per month in 2020.
777 Program The accounting quantity for the 777 program increased by 10 units during 2019 due to the program’s
normal progress of obtaining additional orders and delivering airplanes. In 2013, we launched the 777X, which features
a new composite wing, new engines and folding wing-tips. We have experienced issues in engine design and
development on the 777X. The first flight of the 777X was completed on January 25, 2020, and first delivery is targeted
for 2021. The 777 and 777X programs have a combined production rate of 5 per month. We plan to produce more 777
models and fewer 777X models in the near term than previously planned. We expect to deliver at an average rate of 3
per month in 2020. The 777X will have a separate program accounting quantity, which will be determined in the year of
first airplane delivery.
787 Program At the end of the first quarter of 2019, we increased the production rate from 12 per month to 14 per
month. As a result of fewer orders than anticipated, we plan to reduce the 787 production rate to 12 per month in late
2020 and to 10 per month in early 2021. We plan to return to a production rate of 12 per month in 2023.

Fleet Support We provide the operators of our commercial airplanes with assistance and services to facilitate efficient
and safe airplane operation. Collectively known as fleet support services, these activities and services begin prior to
airplane delivery and continue throughout the operational life of the airplane. They include flight and maintenance
training, field service support, engineering services, information services and systems and technical data and
documents. The costs for fleet support are expensed as incurred and have historically been approximately 1% of total
consolidated costs of products and services.
Program Development The following chart summarizes the time horizon between go-ahead and planned initial
delivery for major Commercial Airplanes derivatives and programs.

We launched the 737 MAX 7, 8 and 9 in August 2011 and the 737 MAX 10 in June 2017. We launched the 787-10 in
June 2013 and the 777X in November 2013.
Additional Considerations
The development and ongoing production of commercial aircraft is extremely complex, involving extensive coordination
and integration with suppliers and highly-skilled labor from employees and other partners. Meeting or exceeding our
performance and reliability standards, as well as those of customers and regulators, can be costly and technologically
challenging. In addition, the introduction of new aircraft and derivatives, such as the 777X, involves increased risks
associated with meeting development, production and certification schedules. As a result, our ability to deliver aircraft
on time, satisfy performance and reliability standards and achieve or maintain, as applicable, program profitability is
subject to significant risks. Factors that could result in lower margins (or a material charge if an airplane program has or
is determined to have reach-forward losses) include the following: changes to the program accounting quantity,
customer and model mix, production costs and rates, changes to price escalation factors due to changes in the inflation
rate or other economic indicators, performance or reliability issues involving completed aircraft, capital expenditures
and other costs associated with increasing or adding new production capacity, learning curve, additional change
incorporation, achieving anticipated cost reductions, flight test and certification schedules, costs, schedule and demand
for new airplanes and derivatives and status of customer claims, supplier claims or assertions and other contractual
negotiations. While we believe the cost and revenue estimates incorporated in the consolidated financial statements
are appropriate, the technical complexity of our airplane programs creates financial risk as additional completion costs
may become necessary or scheduled delivery dates could be extended, which could trigger termination provisions,
order cancellations or other financially significant exposure.
Defense, Space & Security
Business Environment and Trends
United States Government Defense Environment Overview
The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019 raised the Budget Control Act limits on federal discretionary defense and non-
defense spending for fiscal years 2020 and 2021 (FY20 and FY21), reducing budget uncertainty
30
Table of Contents
and the risk of sequestration. The consolidated appropriations acts for FY20, enacted in December 2019, provided
FY20 appropriations for government departments and agencies, including the United States Department of Defense
(U.S. DoD), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).
The enacted FY20 appropriations included funding for Boeing’s major programs, such as the F/A-18 Super Hornet, F-
15EX, CH-47 Chinook, AH-64 Apache, V-22 Osprey, KC-46A Tanker, P-8 Poseidon and Space Launch System.
However, there continues to be uncertainty with respect to future program-level appropriations for the U.S. DoD and
other government agencies, including NASA. Future budget cuts or investment priority changes, including changes
associated with the authorizations and appropriations process, could result in reductions, cancellations and/or delays of
existing contracts or programs. Any of these impacts could have a material effect on our results of operations, financial
position and/or cash flows.
Non-U.S. Defense Environment Overview The non-U.S. market continues to be driven by complex and evolving
security challenges and the need to modernize aging equipment and inventories. BDS expects that it will continue to
have a wide range of opportunities across Asia, Europe and the Middle East given the diverse regional threats. At the
end of 2019, 29% of BDS backlog was attributable to non-U.S. customers.

Since our operating cycle is long-term and involves many different types of development and production contracts with
varying delivery and milestone schedules, the operating results of a particular year, or year-to-year comparisons of
revenues, earnings and backlog may not be indicative of future operating results. In addition, depending on the
customer and their funding sources, our orders might be structured as annual follow-on contracts, or as one large multi-
year order or long-term award. As a result, period-to-period comparisons of backlog are not necessarily indicative of
future workloads. The following discussions of comparative results among periods should be viewed in this context.

Revenues
BDS revenues in 2019 decreased by $165 million compared with 2018 due to timing associated with non-U.S. contract
awards for fighters and the final C-17 sale in 2018, lower revenue related to charges on Commercial Crew, and lower
volume from certain unmanned and vertical lift programs. These reductions were partially offset by increases from new
programs, including E-7 early warning aircraft, VC-25B, T-7A Red Hawk, and MQ-25, as well as from satellites and
weapons. The unfavorable impact of cumulative contract catch-up adjustments in 2019 was $163 million higher than
the comparable period in the prior year, reflecting unfavorable adjustments on the Commercial Crew contract and less
favorable performance.
BDS revenues in 2018 increased by $2,454 million compared with 2017 primarily due to non-US contract awards for
fighters, higher weapons revenue, the final C-17 aircraft sale and higher satellites revenue. The unfavorable impact of
cumulative contract catch-up adjustments in 2018 was $359 million higher than the comparable period in the prior year,
reflecting increased unfavorable adjustments on the KC-46A Tanker recorded in 2018.
Earnings From Operations
BDS earnings from operations in 2019 increased by $951 million compared with 2018 primarily due to lower net
charges on development programs. In 2019, BDS recorded charges of $143 million compared with $722 million in 2018
related to the KC-46A Tanker contract. Also during 2019, BDS recorded charges of $489 million compared with $57
million in 2018 related to the Commercial Crew contract. In 2018, we recorded charges of $691 million related to losses
on the T-7A Red Hawk and MQ-25 contracts. The unfavorable impact of cumulative contract catch-up adjustments in
2019 was $62 million lower than the comparable period in the prior year, reflecting lower net unfavorable adjustments
on development programs.
BDS earnings from operations in 2018 decreased by $726 million compared with 2017 as earnings growth from higher
revenues was more than offset by the higher charges on development programs in 2018. In
32
Table of Contents
2017, BDS recorded charges of $401 million related to the KC-46A Tanker contract. The unfavorable impact of
cumulative contract catch-up adjustments in 2018 was $412 million higher than the comparable period in the prior year,
driven by higher charges on development programs in 2018.
BDS earnings from operations include equity earnings of $128 million, $147 million and $183 million primarily from our
ULA and non-U.S. joint ventures in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Backlog
Total backlog of $63,908 million at December 31, 2019 increased by 4% from $61,277 million at December 31, 2018,
primarily due to current year contract awards in many of our programs greater than revenue recognized. Significant
orders included F/A-18 fighters, Space Launch System, P-8A Poseidon, KC-46A Tanker, and E-7 Airborne Early
Warning & Control, partially offset by revenue recognized on contracts awarded in prior years.
Additional Considerations
Our BDS business includes a variety of development programs which have complex design and technical challenges.
Many of these programs have cost-type contracting arrangements. In these cases, the associated financial risks are
primarily in reduced fees, lower profit rates or program cancellation if cost, schedule or technical performance issues
arise. Examples of these programs include Ground-based Midcourse Defense, Proprietary and Space Launch System
programs.
Some of our development programs are contracted on a fixed-price basis and BDS customers are increasingly seeking
fixed priced proposals for new programs. Examples of significant fixed-price development programs include
Commercial Crew, KC-46A Tanker, T-7A Red Hawk, VC-25B Presidential Aircraft, MQ-25, and commercial and military
satellites. New programs could also have risk for reach-forward loss upon contract award and during the period of
contract performance. Many development programs have highly complex designs. As technical or quality issues arise
during development, we may experience schedule delays and cost impacts, which could increase our estimated cost to
perform the work or reduce our estimated price, either of which could result in a material charge or otherwise adversely
affect our financial condition. These programs are ongoing, and while we believe the cost and fee estimates
incorporated in the financial statements are appropriate, the technical complexity of these programs creates financial
risk as additional completion costs may become necessary or scheduled delivery dates could be extended, which could
trigger termination provisions, the loss of satellite in-orbit incentive payments, or other financially significant exposure.
These programs have risk for reach-forward losses if our estimated costs exceed our estimated contract revenues.
KC-46A Tanker The KC-46A Tanker is a derivative of our 767 commercial aircraft. In 2011, we were awarded a
contract from the U.S. Air Force (USAF) to design, develop, manufacture and deliver next generation aerial refueling
tankers. The contract contains production options for both low rate initial production (LRIP) aircraft and full rate
production aircraft. Since 2016, the USAF has authorized five LRIP lots for a total of 67 aircraft. The Engineering,
Manufacturing and Development (EMD) contract and the five authorized LRIP lots are valued at approximately $15
billion. If all options under the contract are exercised, we expect to deliver 179 aircraft for a total expected contract
value of approximately $30 billion. In January 2019, we delivered the first KC-46A to the USAF, and by December 2019,
we had delivered a total of 28 aircraft.
During 2017, we recorded reach-forward losses of $445 million related to this program, primarily reflecting higher
estimated costs associated with certification and incorporating changes into LRIP aircraft. During 2018, we recorded
additional reach-forward losses of $736 million primarily reflecting higher estimated costs associated with certification,
flight testing and change incorporation on aircraft, as well as higher than expected effort to meet customer
requirements in order to support delivery of the initial aircraft. During 2019, we recorded additional reach-forward losses
of $148 million reflecting higher manufacturing costs.
33
Table of Contents
As with any development program, this program remains subject to additional reach-forward losses and/or delivery
delays if we experience further production, technical or quality issues.
Commercial Crew NASA has contracted us to design and build the CST-100 Starliner spacecraft to transport crews to
the International Space Station. On December 20, 2019 the Starliner launched and successfully landed two days later
completing an abbreviated uncrewed flight test that performed many mission objectives before returning to Earth as the
first orbital land touchdown of a human-rated capsule in U.S. history. The flight test was abbreviated, however, because
anomalies experienced during the mission prevented docking with the International Space Station. In the fourth quarter
of 2019, we recorded an increase to the reach-forward loss of $410 million, primarily to provision for another uncrewed
mission. Root cause analysis is underway and NASA is evaluating the data received during the mission to determine if
another uncrewed mission is required.
T-7A Red Hawk In September 2018, we were selected by the USAF to build the next generation training capability,
known as T-7A Red Hawk (formerly T-X Trainer). The program includes aircraft and simulators as well as support and
ground equipment. The contract is structured as an indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity fixed-price contract with a
minimum of 206 aircraft and a maximum of 475 aircraft. The EMD contract is a fixed-price contract valued at $813
million and includes five aircraft and seven simulators, with a period of performance that runs through 2022. The
production and support contracts are structured as options that begin with authorization from fiscal year 2022 to 2034.
In connection with winning this competition in 2018, we recorded a reach-forward loss of $400 million associated with
anticipated losses on the options for 346 aircraft that we believe are probable of being exercised. During 2019, we
completed the aircraft’s critical design review. We believe that our investment in this contract positions us for additional
market opportunities for both trainer and light attack aircraft.
MQ-25 In August 2018, we were awarded an EMD contract to build the MQ-25 for the U.S. Navy. The EMD contract is
a fixed-price contract that includes development and delivery of four aircraft and test articles at a contract price of $805
million. In connection with winning this competition, we recognized a reach-forward loss of $291 million. The period of
performance runs from 2018 through 2024. In 2019, we conducted a successful first flight. The MQ-25 is the U.S.
Navy’s first operational carrier-based unmanned aircraft, and we believe that our investment in this contract positions
us for long-term leadership in autonomy and artificial intelligence technologies along with additional market
opportunities.

Global Services
Business Environment and Trends
The aerospace markets we serve include parts distribution, logistics, and other inventory services; maintenance,
engineering, and upgrades; training and professional services; and information services. We expect the market to grow
by around 3.5% annually.
As the size of the worldwide commercial airline fleet continues to grow, so does demand for aftermarket services
designed to increase efficiency and extend the economic lives of airplanes. Airlines are using data analytics to plan
flight operations and predictive maintenance to improve their productivity and efficiency. Airlines continue to look for
opportunities to reduce the size and cost of their spare parts inventory, frequently outsourcing spares management to
third parties.
34
Table of Contents
Government services market segments are growing on pace with related fleets, but vary based on the utilization and
age of the aircraft. The U.S. government services market is the single largest individual market, comprising over 50
percent of the government services markets served. Over the next decade, we expect U.S. growth to remain flat and
non-U.S. fleets, led by Middle East and Asia Pacific customers, to add rotorcraft and commercial derivative aircraft at
the fastest rates. We expect less than 20 percent of the worldwide fleet of military aircraft to be retired and replaced
over the next ten years, driving increased demand for services to maintain aging aircraft and enhance aircraft
capability.
BGS’ major customer, the U.S. government, remains subject to the spending limits and uncertainty described on page
30, which could restrict the execution of certain program activities and delay new programs or competitions.
Industry Competitiveness Aviation services is a competitive market with many domestic and international
competitors. This market environment has resulted in intense pressures on pricing and we expect these pressures to
continue or intensify in the coming years. Continued access to global markets remains vital to our ability to fully realize
our sales growth potential and long-term investment returns.

Revenues
BGS revenues in 2019 increased by $1,412 million compared with 2018 due to the acquisition of KLX in the fourth
quarter of 2018 and government services revenue, partially offset by lower commercial services revenue. The favorable
impact of cumulative contract catch-up adjustments in 2019 was $80 million higher than the comparable period in the
prior year.
BGS revenues in 2018 increased by $2,445 million compared with 2017 due to growth across our services portfolio,
primarily driven by higher parts revenue, including the acquisition of KLX. The favorable impact of cumulative contract
catch-up adjustments in 2018 was $63 million lower than the comparable period in the prior year.
Earnings From Operations
BGS earnings from operations in 2019 increased by $161 million compared with 2018. The increase in earnings from
operations reflects higher revenues, which was partially offset by less favorable performance and mix. Earnings from
operations for 2019 also includes a divestiture gain of $395 million and a charge of $293 million related to our decision
in the fourth quarter to retire the Aviall brand and trade name. The favorable impact of cumulative contract catch-up
adjustments in 2019 was $21 million higher than the comparable period in the prior year.
BGS earnings from operations in 2018 increased by $285 million compared with 2017 primarily due to higher revenues,

Boeing Capital
Business Environment and Trends
BCC’s gross customer financing and investment portfolio at December 31, 2019 totaled $2,254 million. A substantial
portion of BCC’s portfolio is related to customers that we believe have less than investment-grade credit. BCC’s
portfolio is also concentrated by varying degrees across Boeing aircraft product types, most notably 717 and 747-8
aircraft.
BCC provided customer financing of $419 million and $601 million during 2019 and 2018. While we may be required to
fund a number of new aircraft deliveries in 2020 and/or provide refinancing for existing bridge debt, we expect
alternative financing will be available at reasonable prices from broad and globally diverse sources.
Aircraft values and lease rates are impacted by the number and type of aircraft that are currently out of service.
Approximately 2,200 western-built commercial jet aircraft (8.5% of current world fleet) were parked at the end of 2019,
including both in-production and out-of-production aircraft types. Of these parked aircraft, approximately 20% are not
expected to return to service. At the end of 2018 and 2017, 6.7% and 8.3% of the western-built commercial jet aircraft
were parked. Aircraft valuations could decline if significant numbers of additional aircraft, particularly types with
relatively few operators, are placed out of service.

Revenues
BCC segment revenues consist principally of lease income from equipment under operating lease, interest income from
financing receivables and notes, and other income. BCC’s revenues in 2019 decreased by $30 million compared with
2018 primarily due to lower gains on the sale of assets. BCC’s revenues in 2018 decreased by $33 million compared
with 2017 primarily due to lower lease income driven by a smaller portfolio, partially offset by gains on asset sales.
Earnings From Operations
BCC’s earnings from operations are presented net of interest expense, provision for (recovery of) losses, asset
impairment expense, depreciation on leased equipment and other operating expenses. Earnings from operations in
2019 decreased by $51 million primarily due to lower revenues and higher asset impairment expenses. Earnings from
operations in 2018 decreased by $35 million primarily due to lower revenues.

BCC’s customer financing and investment portfolio at December 31, 2019 decreased from December 31, 2018,
primarily due to $720 million of note payoffs and portfolio run-off and $250 million related to the impairment of lease
incentives, partially offset by new volume.
BCC enters into certain transactions with Boeing, reflected in Unallocated items, eliminations and other, in the form of
intercompany guarantees and other subsidies that mitigate the effects of certain credit quality or asset impairment
issues on the BCC segment. The $250 million impairment of lease incentives did not result in an earnings charge in the
BCC segment because of an intercompany guarantee.
Leased aircraft with a carrying value of approximately $58 million are scheduled to be returned off lease during 2020.
We are seeking to remarket these aircraft or have the leases extended.

Operating Activities Net cash used by operating activities was $2.4 billion during 2019, compared with net cash
provided by operating activities of $15.3 billion during 2018 and $13.3 billion in 2017. The decrease in operating cash
flows in 2019 primarily reflects the impacts of the 737 MAX grounding that is resulting
37
Table of Contents
in lower earnings, higher inventory and lower advances and progress payments. In addition, compensation payments to
737 MAX customers of $1.2 billion for disruption to their operations also reduced 2019 cash from operating activities.
Cash used to fund Inventory was $12.4 billion during 2019 as we continued to produce aircraft while deliveries were
suspended. Cash provided by Advances and progress billings was $0.7 billion in 2019, as compared with $2.6 billion in
2018. In December 2019, we announced plans to temporarily suspend production of the 737 MAX beginning in January
2020. This will enable us to prioritize the delivery of stored aircraft. Net cash from operating activities in future quarters
is expected to continue to be adversely impacted by the 737 MAX grounding.
Discretionary contributions to our pension plans were insignificant in 2019 and 2018. During 2017, our discretionary
contributions to our pension plans included 14.4 million shares of our common stock with an aggregate value of $3.5
billion and $0.5 billion in cash.
Investing Activities Cash used by investing activities during 2019, 2018 and 2017 was $1.5 billion, $4.6 billion and
$2.1 billion. The reduction in 2019 compared with 2018 is primarily due to acquisitions completed in the second half of
2018 and the timing of investments. Acquisitions net of cash acquired were $0.5 billion in 2019, compared with $3.2
billion in 2018, primarily related to the acquisition of KLX. Proceeds from dispositions was $0.5 billion in 2019 as a
result of the divestiture of two businesses. Capital expenditures totaled $1.8 billion in 2019, relatively consistent with
$1.7 billion in 2018 and 2017. We expect capital expenditures in 2020 to be relatively consistent with 2019. Net
proceeds from investments was $0.1 billion in 2019, $0.3 billion in 2018, and was insignificant in 2017.
Financing Activities Cash provided by financing activities was $5.7 billion during 2019, compared with cash used by
financing activities of $11.7 billion in 2018. The increase of $17.5 billion compared with 2018 primarily reflects higher
net borrowings and lower share repurchases, partially offset by higher dividend payments in 2019. Cash used by
financing activities was $11.7 billion during 2018, an increase of $0.4 billion compared with 2017, primarily due to
higher dividend payments partially offset by higher net borrowings. Net borrowings were $13.2 billion in 2019, $1.4
billion in 2018 and $1.1 billion in 2017.
At December 31, 2019 and 2018 the recorded balance of debt was $27.3 billion and $13.8 billion of which $7.3 billion
and $3.2 billion was classified as short-term. At December 31, 2019 and 2018 this included $2.0 billion and $2.5 billion
of debt attributable to BCC, of which $0.5 billion and $0.5 billion were classified as short-term.
During 2019 and 2018 we repurchased 6.9 million and 26.1 million shares totaling $2.7 billion and $9.0 billion through
our open market share repurchase program. In 2019 and 2018, we had 0.6 million shares transferred to us from
employees for tax withholdings. At December 31, 2019, the amount available under the share repurchase plan,
announced on December 17, 2018, totaled $17.3 billion. Share repurchases under this plan are currently suspended.
We increased our quarterly dividend from $1.71 to $2.055 in December 2018, which resulted in $684 million of higher
dividend payments in 2019 compared with 2018.
Capital Resources We have substantial borrowing capacity. Any future borrowings may affect our credit ratings and
are subject to various debt covenants as described below. We have a commercial paper program that serves as a
source of short-term liquidity. At December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, commercial paper borrowings totaling $6,109
million, $1,895 million and $600 million, respectively, which were supported by unused commitments under the
revolving credit agreement. At December 31, 2019, we had $9.6 billion of unused borrowing capacity on revolving credit
line agreements. We anticipate that these credit lines will primarily serve as backup liquidity to support our general
corporate borrowing needs.
Customer financing commitments totaled $13.4 billion and $19.5 billion at December 31, 2019 and 2018. The decrease
primarily relates to financing commitment expirations and terminations. We anticipate that we will not be required to
fund a significant portion of our financing commitments as we continue to work with third party financiers to provide
alternative financing to customers. Historically, we have not been
38
Table of Contents
required to fund significant amounts of outstanding commitments. However, there can be no assurances that we will not
be required to fund greater amounts than historically required.
As previously announced, we plan to acquire an 80% ownership stake in a joint venture comprised of the commercial
aircraft and services operations of Embraer for $4.2 billion. We expect the transaction to close in the first half of 2020.
In the event we require additional funding to support strategic business opportunities, our commercial aircraft financing
commitments, unfavorable resolution of litigation or other loss contingencies, or other business requirements, including
impacts related to the 737 MAX grounding, we expect to meet increased funding requirements by issuing commercial
paper or term debt. We believe our ability to access external capital resources should be sufficient to satisfy existing
short-term and long-term commitments and plans, and also to provide adequate financial flexibility to take advantage of
potential strategic business opportunities should they arise within the next year. However, there can be no assurance of
the cost or availability of future borrowings under our commercial paper program or in the debt markets.
As of January 31, 2020, we have received commitments from a syndicate of banks sufficient for us to enter into a $12
billion delayed draw two-year term loan credit facility. This facility may be increased at the Company’s option if the
facility is oversubscribed. The facility will enhance our liquidity and is expected to close in February 2020.
At December 31, 2019 and 2018, our pension plans were $15.9 billion and $15.3 billion underfunded as measured
under GAAP. On an Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) basis our plans are more than 100% funded at
December 31, 2019. We do not expect to make significant contributions to our pension plans in 2020. We may be
required to make higher contributions to our pension plans in future years.
At December 31, 2019, we were in compliance with the covenants for our debt and credit facilities. The most restrictive
covenants include a limitation on mortgage debt and sale and leaseback transactions as a percentage of consolidated
net tangible assets (as defined in the credit agreements), and a limitation on consolidated debt as a percentage of total
capital (as defined). When considering debt covenants, we continue to have substantial borrowing capacity.

 We plan to acquire an 80% ownership stake in a joint venture comprised of the commercial aircraft and services operations of Embraer. For
additional information, see Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits Pension cash requirements are based on an estimate of our minimum
funding requirements, pursuant to ERISA regulations, although we may make additional discretionary contributions.
Estimates of other postretirement benefits are based on both our estimated future benefit payments and the estimated
contributions to plans that are funded through trusts.
Purchase Obligations Purchase obligations represent contractual agreements to purchase goods or services that are
legally binding; specify a fixed, minimum or range of quantities; specify a fixed, minimum, variable, or indexed price
provision; and specify approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations include amounts recorded as well as
amounts that are not recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.

Table of Contents
Purchase Obligations Not Recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position Purchase obligations
not recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position include agreements for inventory procurement,
tooling costs, electricity and natural gas contracts, property, plant and equipment, customer financing equipment, and
other miscellaneous production related obligations. The most significant obligation relates to inventory procurement
contracts. We have entered into certain significant inventory procurement contracts that specify determinable prices
and quantities, and long-term delivery timeframes. In addition, we purchase raw materials on behalf of our suppliers.
These agreements require suppliers and vendors to be prepared to build and deliver items in sufficient time to meet our
production schedules. The need for such arrangements with suppliers and vendors arises from the extended
production planning horizon for many of our products. A significant portion of these inventory commitments is supported
by firm contracts and/or has historically resulted in settlement through reimbursement from customers for penalty
payments to the supplier should the customer not take delivery. These amounts are also included in our forecasts of
costs for program and contract accounting. Some inventory procurement contracts may include escalation adjustments.
In these limited cases, we have included our best estimate of the effect of the escalation adjustment in the amounts
disclosed in the table above.
Purchase Obligations Recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position Purchase obligations
recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position primarily include accounts payable and certain other
current and long-term liabilities including accrued compensation.
Industrial Participation Agreements We have entered into various industrial participation agreements with certain
customers outside of the U.S. to facilitate economic flow back and/or technology or skills transfer to their businesses or
government agencies as the result of their procurement of goods and/or services from us. These commitments may be
satisfied by our local operations there, placement of direct work or vendor orders for supplies, opportunities to bid on
supply contracts, transfer of technology or other forms of assistance. However, in certain cases, our commitments may
be satisfied through other parties (such as our vendors) who purchase supplies from our non-U.S. customers. In certain
cases, penalties could be imposed if we do not meet our industrial participation commitments. During 2019, we incurred
no such penalties. As of December 31, 2019, we have outstanding industrial participation agreements totaling $24.8
billion that extend through 2034. Purchase order commitments associated with industrial participation agreements are
included in purchase obligations in the table above. To be eligible for such a purchase order commitment from us, a
non-U.S. supplier must have sufficient capability to meet our requirements and must be competitive in cost, quality and
schedule.

Commercial aircraft financing commitments include commitments to provide financing related to aircraft on order, under
option for deliveries or proposed as part of sales campaigns or refinancing with respect to delivered aircraft, based on
estimated earliest potential funding dates. Based on historical experience, we anticipate that we will not be required to
fund a significant portion of our financing commitments. However, there can be no assurances that we will not be
required to fund greater amounts than historically required. See Note 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Contingent Obligations
We have significant contingent obligations that arise in the ordinary course of business, which include the following:
Legal Various legal proceedings, claims and investigations are pending against us. Legal contingencies are discussed
in Note 22 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
Environmental Remediation We are involved with various environmental remediation activities and have recorded a
liability of $570 million at December 31, 2019. For additional information, see Note 14 to our Consolidated Financial
Statements.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We are a party to certain off-balance sheet arrangements including certain guarantees. For discussion of these
arrangements, see Note 15 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
Non-GAAP Measures
Core Operating Earnings, Core Operating Margin and Core Earnings Per Share
Our Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in
the United States of America (GAAP) which we supplement with certain non-GAAP financial information. These non-
GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP measures, and other
companies may define such measures differently. We encourage investors to review our financial statements and
publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. Core operating earnings, core
operating margin and core earnings per share exclude the FAS/CAS service cost adjustment. The FAS/CAS service
cost adjustment represents the difference between the FAS pension and postretirement service costs calculated under
GAAP and costs allocated to the business segments. Core earnings per share excludes both the FAS/CAS service cost
adjustment and non-operating pension and postretirement expenses. Non-operating pension and postretirement
expenses represent the components of net periodic benefit costs other than service cost. Pension costs, comprising
service and prior service costs computed in accordance with GAAP are allocated to BCA and certain BGS businesses
supporting commercial customers. Pension costs allocated to BDS and BGS businesses supporting government
customers are computed in accordance with U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS), which employ
different actuarial assumptions and accounting conventions than GAAP. CAS costs are allocable to government
contracts. Other postretirement benefit costs are allocated to all business segments based on CAS, which is generally
based on benefits paid.
The Pension FAS/CAS service cost adjustment recognized in (loss)/earnings from operations during 2019 was a
benefit of $1,071 million, largely consistent with a benefit of $1,005 million in 2018 and $1,127 million in 2017. The non-
operating pension expense included in Other income, net was a benefit of $374 million in 2019, $143 million in 2018
and $117 million in 2017. The benefits in 2019, 2018, and 2017 reflect expected returns in excess of interest cost and
amortization of actuarial losses. 
For further discussion of pension and other postretirement costs see the Management’s Discussion and Analysis on
page 22 of this Form 10-K and see Note 23 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Management uses core
operating earnings, core operating margin and core earnings per share for purposes of evaluating and forecasting
underlying business performance. Management believes these core earnings measures provide investors additional
insights into operational performance as unallocated

Critical Accounting Policies & Estimates
Accounting for long-term contracts
Substantially all contracts at BDS and certain contracts at BGS are long-term contracts. Our long-term contracts
typically represent a single distinct performance obligation due to the highly interdependent and interrelated nature of
the underlying goods and/or services and the significant service of integration that we provide.
Accounting for long-term contracts involves a judgmental process of estimating the total sales, costs, and profit for each
performance obligation. Cost of sales is recognized as incurred and revenue is determined by adding a proportionate
amount of the estimated profit to the amount reported as cost of sales.
Due to the size, duration and nature of many of our long-term contracts, the estimation of total sales and costs through
completion is complicated and subject to many variables. Total sales estimates are based on negotiated contract prices
and quantities, modified by our assumptions regarding contract options, change orders, incentive and award provisions
associated with technical performance, and price adjustment clauses (such as inflation or index-based clauses). The
majority of these long-term contracts are with the U.S. government where the price is generally based on estimated
cost to produce the product or service plus profit. Federal Acquisition Regulations provide guidance on the types of cost
that will be reimbursed in establishing contract price. Total cost estimates are largely based on negotiated or estimated
purchase contract terms, historical performance trends, business base and other economic projections. Factors that
influence these estimates include inflationary trends, technical and schedule risk, internal and subcontractor
performance trends, business volume assumptions, asset utilization, and anticipated labor agreements.
Revenue and cost estimates for all significant long-term contract performance obligations are reviewed and reassessed
quarterly. Changes in these estimates could result in recognition of cumulative catch-up adjustments to the
performance obligation’s inception to date revenues, cost of sales and profit, in the period in which such changes are
made. Changes in revenue and cost estimates could also result in a reach-forward loss or an adjustment to a reach-
forward loss, which would be recorded immediately in earnings. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 net
unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments, including reach-forward losses, across all long-term contracts decreased
Earnings from operations by $111 million and $190 million. For the year ended December 31, 2017, net favorable
cumulative catch-up adjustments, including reach-forward losses, across all long-term contracts increased Earnings
from operations by $250 million.
Due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above, it is likely that materially different
earnings could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change.
Changes in underlying assumptions/estimates, supplier performance, or circumstances may adversely or positively
affect financial performance in future periods. If the combined gross margin for all long-term contract performance
obligations for all of 2019 had been estimated to be higher or lower by 1%, it would have increased or decreased pre-
tax income for the year by approximately $330 million. In addition, a number of our fixed price development contracts
are in a reach-forward loss position. Changes to estimated losses are recorded immediately in earnings.

Program Accounting
Program accounting requires the demonstrated ability to reliably estimate the relationship of sales to costs for the
defined program accounting quantity. A program consists of the estimated number of units (accounting quantity) of a
product to be produced in a continuing, long-term production effort for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts.
The determination of the accounting quantity is limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates of the
revenue and cost of existing and anticipated contracts. For each program, the amount reported as cost of sales is
determined by applying the estimated cost of sales percentage for the total remaining program to the amount of sales
recognized for airplanes delivered and accepted by the customer.
Factors that must be estimated include program accounting quantity, sales price, labor and employee benefit costs,
material costs, procured part costs, major component costs, overhead costs, program tooling and other non-recurring
costs, and warranty costs. Estimation of the accounting quantity for each program takes into account several factors
that are indicative of the demand for the particular program, such as firm orders, letters of intent from prospective
customers, and market studies. Total estimated program sales are determined by estimating the model mix and sales
price for all unsold units within the accounting quantity, added together with the sales prices for all undelivered units
under contract. The sales prices for all undelivered units within the accounting quantity include an escalation
adjustment for inflation that is updated quarterly. Cost estimates are based largely on negotiated and anticipated
contracts with suppliers, historical performance trends, and business base and other economic projections. Factors that
influence these estimates include production rates, internal and subcontractor performance trends, customer and/or
supplier claims or assertions, asset utilization, anticipated labor agreements, and inflationary or deflationary trends.
To ensure reliability in our estimates, we employ a rigorous estimating process that is reviewed and updated on a
quarterly basis. Changes in estimates are normally recognized on a prospective basis; however, when estimated costs
to complete a program exceed estimated revenues from undelivered units in the accounting quantity, a loss provision is
recorded in the current period for the estimated loss on all undelivered units in the accounting quantity.
The program method of accounting allocates tooling and other non-recurring and production costs over the accounting
quantity for each program. Because of the higher unit production costs experienced at the beginning of a new program
and substantial investment required for initial tooling and other non-recurring costs, new commercial aircraft programs,
such as the 777X program, typically have lower initial margins than established programs. In addition, actual costs
incurred for earlier units in excess of the estimated average cost of all units in the program accounting quantity are
included within program inventory as deferred production costs. Deferred production, unamortized tooling and other
non-recurring costs are expected to be fully recovered when all units in the accounting quantity are delivered as the
expected unit cost for later deliveries is below the estimated average cost as learning curve and other improvements
are realized.
Due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above, it is reasonably possible that changes in
underlying circumstances or assumptions could have a material effect on program gross margins. If the combined
gross margin percentages for our commercial airplane programs had been estimated to be 1% higher or lower it would
have an approximately $400 million impact on operating earnings for the year ended December 31, 2019.
737 MAX Grounding
On March 13, 2019, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued an order to suspend operations of all 737 MAX
aircraft in the U.S. and by U.S. aircraft operators following two fatal 737 MAX accidents. Non-U.S. civil aviation
authorities have issued directives to the same effect. The grounding is having a significant adverse impact on our
operations and creates significant uncertainty.
45
Table of Contents
Multiple legal actions have been filed against us as a result of the October 29, 2018 accident of Lion Air Flight 610 and
the March 10, 2019 accident of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302. Further, we are fully cooperating with all ongoing
governmental and regulatory investigations and inquiries relating to the accidents and the 737 MAX, including
investigations by the U.S. Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission. We cannot reasonably
estimate a range of loss, if any, not covered by available insurance that may result given the ongoing status of these
lawsuits, investigations, and inquiries. We have also experienced claims and/or assertions from customers and
suppliers in connection with the grounding. As a result of the grounding, we reduced the 737 production rate from 52
per month to 42 per month in 2019 and in December 2019, we announced plans to temporarily suspend 737 production
beginning in January 2020. We have concluded that the suspension of production and the gradual resumption of
production at low production rates will result in abnormal production costs which will be expensed when incurred rather
than inventoried. Prior to the grounding, we had planned to increase the production rate to 57 per month in 2019.
In the preparation of our financial statements, we have made assumptions regarding outcomes of accident
investigations and other government inquiries, timing and conditions of return to service, the duration of the 737 MAX
production suspension and timing of future 737 production rate increases, supplier readiness to support production rate
changes, timing and sequence of future customer deliveries as well as outcomes of negotiations with customers
impacted by the grounding. We have also made significant assumptions regarding estimated costs expected to be
incurred in 2020 and 2021 that should be included in program inventory and those costs that should be expensed when
incurred as abnormal production costs. While these assumptions reflect our best estimate at this time, they are highly
uncertain and significantly affect the estimates inherent in our financial statements.
The FAA and other non-U.S. civil aviation authorities will determine the timing and conditions of the 737 MAX return to
service in each relevant jurisdiction. We have assumed that regulatory approval of the 737 MAX will enable deliveries
to resume during mid-2020. We have also assumed that, as a condition of return to service, regulators will require 737
MAX pilots to undergo computer and simulator training. We have assumed that we will resume 737 MAX aircraft
production at low rates in 2020 as timing and conditions of return to service are better understood, and then we expect
to gradually increase to previously planned production rates over the next few years. We are also assuming that 737
MAX airplanes produced during the grounding and included within inventory will be delivered over several quarters with
the majority of them delivering during the first year after the resumption of deliveries. The cumulative impacts of
changes to assumptions regarding timing of return to service and timing of planned production rates have increased the
estimated costs to produce aircraft included in the current accounting quantity by approximately $6.3 billion, which will
be recorded in program inventory. In addition, the suspension of 737 MAX production and lower production rates is
expected to result in approximately $4.0 billion of abnormal production costs in 2020 and 2021 that will be expensed as
incurred. The increases in the estimated costs accounted for as program inventory will reduce 737 program and overall
BCA segment operating margins in future periods after deliveries resume. Production costs incurred while production is
suspended and a portion of production costs incurred while we gradually increase production rates to a normal level will
be expensed as incurred as abnormal costs and will not be included in program inventory. We may face additional
costs, delays in regulatory approval of the 737 MAX and/or the resumption of deliveries, and/or further delays in
planned production rate increases which may result in further increases in program costs and/or abnormal production
costs.
We recorded an earnings charge and corresponding liability of $6.1 billion, in the second quarter of 2019, in connection
with an estimate of potential concessions and other considerations to customers for disruptions related to the 737 MAX
grounding and associated delivery delays. The second quarter estimate of $6.1 billion was updated in the third and
fourth quarters of 2019. The remaining liability of $7.4 billion at December 31, 2019 represents our current best
estimate of future concessions and other considerations we expect to provide to customers. This estimate relies on the
exercise of judgment by management and is significantly impacted by the assumptions described above, as well as the
status of negotiations with
46
Table of Contents
our customers. Any delays in our ability to resume deliveries, prolonged production suspension, further disruptions to
our production system, supplier claims or assertions, or changes to estimated concessions and other considerations we
expect to provide to customers could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations,
and/or cash flows.
Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Impairments
We test goodwill for impairment by performing a qualitative assessment or using a two-step impairment process. If we
choose to perform a qualitative assessment, we evaluate economic, industry and company-specific factors as an initial
step in assessing the fair value of operations. If we determine it is more likely than not that the carrying value of the net
assets is more than the fair value of the related operations, the two-step impairment process is then performed;
otherwise, no further testing is required. For operations where the two-step impairment process is used, we first
compare the book value of net assets to the fair value of the related operations. If the fair value is determined to be less
than book value, a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment. In this process, a fair value for
goodwill is estimated, based in part on the fair value of the operations, and is compared to its carrying value. The
shortfall of the fair value below carrying value represents the amount of goodwill impairment.
We estimate the fair values of the related operations using discounted cash flows. Forecasts of future cash flows are
based on our best estimate of future sales and operating costs, based primarily on existing firm orders, expected future
orders, contracts with suppliers, labor agreements and general market conditions. Changes in these forecasts could
significantly change the amount of impairment recorded, if any.
The cash flow forecasts are adjusted by an appropriate discount rate derived from our market capitalization plus a
suitable control premium at the date of evaluation. Therefore, changes in the stock price may also affect the amount of
impairment recorded, if any.
We completed our assessment of goodwill as of April 1, 2019 and determined that there is no impairment of goodwill.
As of December 31, 2019, we estimated that the fair value of each reporting unit significantly exceeded its
corresponding carrying value. Changes in our forecasts, or decreases in the value of our common stock could cause
book values of certain operations to exceed their fair values which may result in goodwill impairment charges in future
periods.
As of December 31, 2018, we had $490 million of indefinite-lived intangible assets related to the Jeppesen and Aviall
brand and trade names acquired in business combinations. During 2019, we changed the name of the Aviall business
to Boeing Distribution Inc. and, in the fourth quarter, decided to retire the Aviall brand and trade name. As a result we
recorded an earnings charge of $293 million to write-off the Aviall indefinite-lived intangible asset. Accordingly, as of
December 31, 2019, we had an indefinite-lived intangible asset with a carrying value of $197 million related to the
Jeppesen brand and trade name.
We test these intangibles for impairment by comparing their carrying value to current projections of discounted cash
flows attributable to the brand and trade names. Any excess carrying value over the amount of discounted cash flows
represents the amount of the impairment. A 10% decrease in the discounted cash flows would not impact the carrying
value of the Jeppesen indefinite-lived intangible asset.

Pension Plans
The majority of our employees have earned benefits under defined benefit pension plans. Nonunion and the majority of
union employees that had participated in defined benefit pension plans transitioned to a company-funded defined
contribution retirement savings plan in 2016. Additional union employees transitioned to company-funded defined
contribution retirement savings plans effective January 1, 2019. Accounting rules require an annual measurement of
our projected obligation and plan assets. These measurements are based upon several assumptions, including the
discount rate and the expected long-term rate of asset return. Future changes in assumptions or differences between
actual and expected outcomes can significantly affect our future annual expense, projected benefit obligation and
Shareholders’ equity.
The following table shows the sensitivity of our pension plan liability and net periodic cost to a 25 basis point change in
the discount rate as of December 31, 2019.

Projected benefit obligation ($2,231) $2,778
Net periodic pension cost (10) 20
Pension cost is also sensitive to changes in the expected long-term rate of asset return. A decrease or increase of 25
basis points in the expected long-term rate of asset return would have increased or decreased 2019 net periodic
pension cost by $149 million.
Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
Interest Rate Risk
We have financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk, principally fixed-rate debt obligations, and customer
financing assets and liabilities. Historically, we have not experienced material gains or losses on our customer financing
assets and liabilities due to interest rate changes. As of December 31, 2019, the impact over the next 12 months of a
100 basis point rise in interest rates to our pre-tax earnings would not be significant. The investors in our fixed-rate debt
obligations do not generally have the right to demand we pay off these obligations prior to maturity. Therefore, exposure
to interest rate risk is not believed to be material for our fixed-rate debt.
Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk
We are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk relating to receipts from customers and payments to suppliers in
foreign currencies. We use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the price risk associated with firmly committed
and forecasted foreign denominated payments and receipts related to our ongoing business. Foreign currency forward
contracts are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. At December 31, 2019, a 10% increase or
decrease in the exchange rate in our portfolio of foreign currency contracts would have increased or decreased our
unrealized losses by $226 million. Consistent with the use of these contracts to neutralize the effect of exchange rate
fluctuations, such unrealized losses or gains would be offset by corresponding gains or losses, respectively, in the
remeasurement of the underlying transactions being hedged. When taken together, these forward currency contracts
and the offsetting underlying commitments do not create material market risk.
48
Table of Contents
Commodity Price Risk
We are subject to commodity price risk relating to commodity purchase contracts for items used in production that are
subject to changes in the market price. We use commodity swaps to hedge against these potentially unfavorable price
changes. Our commodity purchase contracts and derivatives are both sensitive to changes in the market price. At
December 31, 2019, a 10% increase or decrease in the market price in our commodity derivatives would have
increased or decreased our unrealized losses by $63 million. Consistent with the use of these contracts to neutralize
the effect of market price fluctuations, such unrealized losses or gains would be offset by corresponding gains or
losses, respectively, in the remeasurement of the underlying transactions being hedged. When taken together, these
commodity purchase contracts and the offsetting swaps do not create material market risk.

Years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017
(Dollars in millions, except per share data)
Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation
The Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report have been prepared by management of The Boeing
Company (herein referred to as “Boeing,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”). These statements include the accounts
of all majority-owned subsidiaries and variable interest entities that are required to be consolidated. All significant
intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. As described in Note 23, we operate in four reportable
segments: Commercial Airplanes (BCA); Defense, Space & Security (BDS), Global Services (BGS), and Boeing Capital
(BCC). Effective at the beginning of 2019, all revenues and costs associated with military derivative aircraft production
are reported in the BDS segment. Amounts in prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current year
presentation.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Operating Cycle
For classification of certain current assets and liabilities, we use the duration of the related contract or program as our
operating cycle, which is generally longer than one year.
Standards Issued and Implemented
In the first quarter of 2019, we adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) and
recognized on our Consolidated Statement of Financial Position $1,064 of lease liabilities with corresponding right-of-
use assets for operating leases. Our accounting for finance leases and lessor contracts remains substantially
unchanged. The standard has no impact to cash provided or used by operating, investing, or financing activities on our
Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. As permitted under the standard, we elected prospective application of the
new guidance and prior periods continue to be presented in accordance with Topic 840. We also elected the package
of practical expedients, which among other things, does not require reassessment of lease classification. See Note 9
and 13 for additional disclosures.
In the first quarter of 2019, we adopted ASU 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815), using the modified
retrospective method. The standard refines and simplifies hedge accounting requirements for both financial and
commodity risks. The impact of the adoption was not material. See Note 20 for additional disclosures.

Table of Contents
Revenue and Related Cost Recognition
Commercial aircraft contracts The majority of our BCA segment revenue is derived from commercial aircraft
contracts. For each contract, we determine the transaction price based on the consideration expected to be received.
We allocate the transaction price to each commercial aircraft performance obligation based on relative standalone
selling prices adjusted by an escalation formula as specified in the customer agreement. Revenue is recognized for
each commercial aircraft performance obligation at the point in time when the aircraft is completed and accepted by the
customer. We use program accounting to determine the amount reported as cost of sales.
In certain situations, where an aircraft is still in our possession, and title and risk of loss has passed to the customer
(known as a bill-and-hold arrangement), revenue will be recognized when all specific requirements for transfer of
control under a bill-and-hold arrangement have been met.
Payments for commercial aircraft sales are received in accordance with the customer agreement, which generally
includes a deposit upon order and additional payments in accordance with a payment schedule, with the balance being
due immediately prior to or at aircraft delivery. Advances and progress billings (contract liabilities) are normal and
customary for commercial aircraft contracts and not considered a significant financing component as they are intended
to protect us from the other party failing to adequately complete some or all of its obligations under the contract.
Long-term contracts Substantially all contracts at BDS and certain contracts at BGS are long-term contracts with the
U.S. government and other customers that generally extend over several years. Products sales under long-term
contracts primarily include fighter jets, rotorcraft, cybersecurity products, surveillance suites, advanced weapons,
missile defense, military derivative aircraft, satellite systems, and modification of commercial passenger aircraft to
cargo freighters. Services sales under long-term contracts primarily include support and maintenance agreements
associated with our commercial and defense products and space travel on Commercial Crew.
For each long-term contract, we determine the transaction price based on the consideration expected to be received.
We allocate the transaction price to each distinct performance obligation to deliver a good or service, or a collection of
goods and/or services, based on the relative standalone selling prices. A long-term contract will typically represent a
single distinct performance obligation due to the highly interdependent and interrelated nature of the underlying goods
and/or services and the significant service of integration that we provide. While the scope and price on certain long-
term contracts may be modified over their life, the transaction price is based on current rights and obligations under the
contract and does not include potential modifications until they are agreed upon with the customer. When applicable, a
cumulative adjustment or separate recognition for the additional scope and price may result. Long-term contracts can
be negotiated with a fixed price or a price in which we are reimbursed for costs incurred plus an agreed upon profit. The
Federal Acquisition Regulations provide guidance on the types of cost that will be reimbursed in establishing the price
for contracts with the U.S. government. Certain long-term contracts include in the transaction price variable
consideration, such as incentive and award fees, if specified targets are achieved. The amount included in the
transaction price represents the expected value, based on a weighted probability, or the most likely amount.
Long-term contract revenue is recognized over the contract term (over time) as the work progresses, either as products
are produced or as services are rendered. We generally recognize revenue over time as we perform on long-term
contracts because of continuous transfer of control to the customer. For U.S. government contracts, this continuous
transfer of control to the customer is supported by clauses in the contract that allow the customer to unilaterally
terminate the contract for convenience, pay us for costs incurred plus a reasonable profit and take control of any work
in process. Similarly, for non-U.S. government contracts, the customer typically controls the work in process as
evidenced either by contractual termination
58

clauses or by our rights to payment of the transaction price associated with work performed to date on products or
services that do not have an alternative use to the Company.
The accounting for long-term contracts involves a judgmental process of estimating total sales, costs and profit for each
performance obligation. Cost of sales is recognized as incurred. The amount reported as revenues is determined by
adding a proportionate amount of the estimated profit to the amount reported as cost of sales. Recognizing revenue as
costs are incurred provides an objective measure of progress on the long-term contract and thereby best depicts the
extent of transfer of control to the customer.
Changes in estimated revenues, cost of sales and the related effect on operating income are recognized using a
cumulative catch-up adjustment which recognizes in the current period the cumulative effect of the changes on current
and prior periods based on a long-term contract’s percentage-of-completion. When the current estimates of total sales
and costs for a long-term contract indicate a loss, a provision for the entire reach-forward loss on the long-term contract
is recognized.
Net cumulative catch-up adjustments to prior years' revenue and earnings, including certain reach-forward losses,
across all long-term contracts were as follows:
 2019 2018 2017
Increase to Revenue $54 $137 $559
(Decrease)/increase to (Loss)/earnings from Operations ($111) ($190) $250
(Decrease)/increase to Diluted EPS ($0.06) ($0.29) $0.34
Significant adjustments during the three years ended December 31, 2019 included reach-forward losses of $148, $736
and $445 on KC-46A Tanker recorded during 2019, 2018, and 2017, as well as reach-forward losses on Commercial
Crew of $489 during 2019.
Due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process, changes in underlying assumptions/estimates, supplier
performance, or circumstances may adversely or positively affect financial performance in future periods.
Payments under long-term contracts may be received before or after revenue is recognized. The U.S. government
customer typically withholds payment of a small portion of the contract price until contract completion. Therefore, long-
term contracts typically generate Unbilled receivables (contract assets) but may generate Advances and progress
billings (contract liabilities). Long-term contract Unbilled receivables and Advances and progress billings are not
considered a significant financing component because they are intended to protect either the customer or the Company
in the event that some or all of the obligations under the contract are not completed.
Commercial spare parts contracts Certain contracts at our BGS segment include sales of commercial spare parts.
For each contract, we determine the transaction price based on the consideration expected to be received. The spare
parts have discrete unit prices that represent fair value. We generally consider each spare part to be a separate
performance obligation. Revenue is recognized for each commercial spare part performance obligation at the point in
time of delivery to the customer. We may provide our customers with a right to return a commercial spare part where a
customer may receive a full or partial refund, a credit applied to amounts owed, a different product in exchange, or any
combination of these items. We consider the potential for customer returns in the estimated transaction price. The
amount reported as cost of sales is recorded at average cost. Payments for commercial spare parts sales are typically
received shortly after delivery.
Other service revenue contracts Certain contracts at our BGS segment are for sales of services to commercial
customers including maintenance, training, data analytics and information-based services. We recognize revenue for
these service performance obligations over time as the services are rendered.
59
Table of Contents
The method of measuring progress (such as straight-line or billable amount) varies depending upon which method best
depicts the transfer of control to the customer based on the type of service performed. Cost of sales is recorded as
incurred.
Concession Sharing Arrangements We account for sales concessions to our customers in consideration of their
purchase of products and services as a reduction of the transaction price and the revenue that is recognized for the
related performance obligations. The sales concessions incurred may be partially reimbursed by certain suppliers in
accordance with concession sharing arrangements. We record these reimbursements, which are presumed to
represent reductions in the price of the vendor’s products or services, as a reduction in Cost of products.
Unbilled Receivables and Advances and Progress Billings Unbilled receivables (contract assets) arise when the
Company recognizes revenue for amounts which cannot yet be billed under terms of the contract with the customer.
Advances and progress billings (contract liabilities) arise when the Company receives payments from customers in
advance of recognizing revenue. The amount of Unbilled receivables or Advances and progress billings is determined
for each contract.
Financial Services Revenue We record financial services revenue associated with sales-type/finance leases,
operating leases, and notes receivable.
Lease and financing revenue arrangements are included in Sales of services on the Consolidated Statements of
Operations. For sales-type/finance leases, we record financing receivables at lease inception. A financing receivable is
recorded at the aggregate of future minimum lease payments, estimated residual value of the leased equipment, and
deferred incremental direct costs less unearned income. Income is recognized over the life of the lease to approximate
a level rate of return on the net investment. Income recognition is generally suspended for financing receivables at the
date full recovery of income and principal becomes not probable. Income is recognized when financing receivables
become contractually current and performance is demonstrated by the customer. Residual values, which are reviewed
periodically, represent the estimated amount we expect to receive at lease termination from the disposition of the
leased equipment. Actual residual values realized could differ from these estimates. Declines in estimated residual
value that are deemed other-than-temporary are recognized in the period in which the declines occur.
For operating leases, revenue on leased aircraft and equipment is recorded on a straight-line basis over the term of the
lease. Operating lease assets, included in Customer financing, are recorded at cost and depreciated over the period
that we project we will hold the asset to an estimated residual value, using the straight-line method. We periodically
review our estimates of residual value and recognize forecasted changes by prospectively adjusting depreciation
expense.
For notes receivable, notes are recorded net of any unamortized discounts and deferred incremental direct costs.
Interest income and amortization of any discounts are recorded ratably over the related term of the note.
Reinsurance Revenue Our wholly-owned insurance subsidiary, Astro Ltd., participates in a reinsurance pool for
workers’ compensation. The member agreements and practices of the reinsurance pool minimize any participating
members’ individual risk. Reinsurance revenues were $151, $145 and $141 during 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Reinsurance costs related to premiums and claims paid to the reinsurance pool were $150, $136 and $144 during
2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Revenues and costs are presented net in Cost of sales in the Consolidated
Statements of Operations.

Fleet support activity begins prior to aircraft delivery as the customer receives training, manuals, and technical
consulting support. This activity continues throughout the aircraft’s operational life. Services provided after delivery
include field service support, consulting on maintenance, repair, and operational issues brought forth by the customer
or regulators, updating manuals and engineering data, and the issuance of service bulletins that impact the entire
model’s fleet. Field service support involves our personnel located at customer facilities providing and coordinating fleet
support activities and requests. The costs for fleet support are expensed as incurred as Cost of services.
Research and Development
Research and development includes costs incurred for experimentation, design, and testing, as well as bid and
proposal efforts related to government products and services which are expensed as incurred unless the costs are
related to certain contractual arrangements with customers. Costs that are incurred pursuant to such contractual
arrangements are recorded over the period that revenue is recognized, consistent with our contract accounting policy.
We have certain research and development arrangements that meet the requirement for best efforts research and
development accounting. Accordingly, the amounts funded by the customer are recognized as an offset to our research
and development expense rather than as contract revenues. Research and development expense included bid and
proposal costs of $214, $234 and $288 in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Share-Based Compensation
We provide various forms of share-based compensation to our employees. For awards settled in shares, we measure
compensation expense based on the grant-date fair value net of estimated forfeitures. For awards settled in cash, or
that may be settled in cash, we measure compensation expense based on the fair value at each reporting date net of
estimated forfeitures. The expense is recognized over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period
of the award.
Income Taxes
Provisions for U.S. federal, state and local, and non-U.S. income taxes are calculated on reported (Loss)/earnings
before income taxes based on current tax law and also include, in the current period, the cumulative effect of any
changes in tax rates from those used previously in determining deferred tax assets and liabilities. Such provisions differ
from the amounts currently receivable or payable because certain items of income and expense are recognized in
different time periods for financial reporting purposes than for income tax purposes. Significant judgment is required in
determining income tax provisions and evaluating tax positions.
The accounting for uncertainty in income taxes requires a more-likely-than-not threshold for financial statement
recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We record a liability for the
difference between the benefit recognized and measured for financial statement purposes and the tax position taken or
expected to be taken on our tax return. To the extent that our assessment of such tax positions changes, the change in
estimate is recorded in the period in which the determination is made. Tax-related interest and penalties are classified
as a component of Income tax benefit/(expense).
Postretirement Plans
The majority of our employees have earned benefits under defined benefit pension plans. Nonunion and the majority of
union employees that had participated in defined benefit pension plans transitioned to a company-funded defined
contribution retirement savings plan in 2016. We also provide postretirement
61
Table of Contents
benefit plans other than pensions, consisting principally of health care coverage to eligible retirees and qualifying
dependents. Benefits under the pension and other postretirement benefit plans are generally based on age at
retirement and years of service and, for some pension plans, benefits are also based on the employee’s annual
earnings. The net periodic cost of our pension and other postretirement plans is determined using the projected unit
credit method and several actuarial assumptions, the most significant of which are the discount rate, the long-term rate
of asset return, and medical trend (rate of growth for medical costs). A portion of the service cost component of net
periodic pension and other postretirement income or expense is not recognized in net earnings in the year incurred
because it is allocated to production as product costs, and reflected in inventory at the end of a reporting period.
Actuarial gains and losses, which occur when actual experience differs from actuarial assumptions, are reflected in
Shareholders’ equity (net of taxes). If actuarial gains and losses exceed ten percent of the greater of plan assets or
plan liabilities we amortize them over the average expected future lifetime of participants. The funded status of our
pension and postretirement plans is reflected on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.
Postemployment Plans
We record a liability for postemployment benefits, such as severance or job training, when payment is probable, the
amount is reasonably estimable, and the obligation relates to rights that have vested or accumulated.
Environmental Remediation
We are subject to federal and state requirements for protection of the environment, including those for discharge of
hazardous materials and remediation of contaminated sites. We routinely assess, based on in-depth studies, expert
analyses and legal reviews, our contingencies, obligations, and commitments for remediation of contaminated sites,
including assessments of ranges and probabilities of recoveries from other responsible parties and/or insurance
carriers. Our policy is to accrue and charge to current expense identified exposures related to environmental
remediation sites when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated.
The amount of the liability is based on our best estimate or the low end of a range of reasonably possible exposure for
investigation, cleanup, and monitoring costs to be incurred. Estimated remediation costs are not discounted to present
value as the timing of payments cannot be reasonably estimated. We may be able to recover a portion of the
remediation costs from insurers or other third parties. Such recoveries are recorded when realization of the claim for
recovery is deemed probable.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid instruments, such as commercial paper, time deposits, and other
money market instruments, which have original maturities of three months or less. We aggregate our cash balances by
bank where conditions for right of set-off are met, and reclassify any negative balances, consisting mainly of uncleared
checks, to Accounts payable. Negative balances reclassified to Accounts payable were $101 and $127 at December
31, 2019 and 2018.
Inventories
Inventoried costs on commercial aircraft programs and long-term contracts include direct engineering, production and
tooling and other non-recurring costs, and applicable overhead, which includes fringe benefits, production related
indirect and plant management salaries and plant services, not in excess of estimated net realizable value. To the
extent a material amount of such costs are related to an abnormal event or are fixed costs not appropriately attributable
to our programs or contracts, they are expensed in the current period rather than inventoried. Inventoried costs include
amounts relating to programs and contracts with long-term production cycles, a portion of which is not expected to be
realized within one
62
Table of Contents
year. Included in inventory for federal government contracts is an allocation of allowable costs related to manufacturing
process reengineering.
Commercial aircraft programs inventory includes deferred production costs and supplier advances. Deferred production
costs represent actual costs incurred for production of early units that exceed the estimated average cost of all units in
the program accounting quantity. Higher production costs are experienced at the beginning of a new or derivative
airplane program. Units produced early in a program require substantially more effort (labor and other resources) than
units produced later in a program because of volume efficiencies and the effects of learning. We expect that these
deferred costs will be fully recovered when all units included in the accounting quantity are delivered as the expected
unit cost for later deliveries is below the estimated average cost of all units in the program. Supplier advances
represent payments for parts we have contracted to receive from suppliers in the future. As parts are received, supplier
advances are amortized to work in process.
The determination of net realizable value of long-term contract costs is based upon quarterly reviews that estimate
costs to be incurred to complete all contract requirements. When actual contract costs and the estimate to complete
exceed total estimated contract revenues, a loss provision is recorded. The determination of net realizable value of
commercial aircraft program costs is based upon quarterly program reviews that estimate revenue and cost to be
incurred to complete the program accounting quantity. When estimated costs to complete exceed estimated program
revenues to go, a program loss provision is recorded in the current period for the estimated loss on all undelivered units
in the accounting quantity.
Used aircraft purchased by the Commercial Airplanes segment and general stock materials are stated at cost not in
excess of net realizable value. See ‘Aircraft Valuation’ within this Note for a discussion of our valuation of used aircraft.
Spare parts inventory is stated at lower of average unit cost or net realizable value. We review our commercial spare
parts and general stock materials quarterly to identify impaired inventory, including excess or obsolete inventory, based
on historical sales trends, expected production usage, and the size and age of the aircraft fleet using the part. Impaired
inventories are charged to Cost of products in the period the impairment occurs.
Included in inventory for commercial aircraft programs are amounts paid or credited in cash, or other consideration to
certain airline customers, that are referred to as early issue sales consideration. Early issue sales consideration is
recognized as a reduction to revenue when the delivery of the aircraft under contract occurs. If an airline customer does
not perform and take delivery of the contracted aircraft, we believe that we would have the ability to recover amounts
paid. However, to the extent early issue sales consideration exceeds advances and is not considered to be otherwise
recoverable, it would be written off in the current period.
Precontract Costs
We may, from time to time, incur costs in excess of the amounts required for existing contracts. If we determine the
costs are probable of recovery from future orders, then we capitalize the precontract costs we incur, excluding start-up
costs which are expensed as incurred. Capitalized precontract costs are included in Inventories in the accompanying
Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Should future orders not materialize or we determine the costs are no
longer probable of recovery, the capitalized costs would be written off.
Property, Plant and Equipment
Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost, including applicable construction-period interest, less accumulated
depreciation and are depreciated principally over the following estimated useful lives: new buildings and land
improvements, from 10 to 40 years; and new machinery and equipment, from 4 to 20 years. The principal methods of
depreciation are as follows: buildings and land improvements, 150%
63
Table of Contents
declining balance; and machinery and equipment, sum-of-the-years’ digits. Capitalized internal use software is included
in Other assets and amortized using the straight line method over 5 years. Capitalized software as a service is included
in Other assets and amortized using the straight line method over the term of the hosting arrangement which is typically
no greater than 10 years. We periodically evaluate the appropriateness of remaining depreciable lives assigned to long-
lived assets, including assets that may be subject to a management plan for disposition.
Long-lived assets held for sale are stated at the lower of cost or fair value less cost to sell. Long-lived assets held for
use are subject to an impairment assessment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
amount may not be recoverable. If the carrying value is no longer recoverable based upon the undiscounted future
cash flows of the asset, the amount of the impairment is the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value
of the asset.
Leases We determine if an arrangement is, or contains, a lease at the inception date. Operating leases are included in
Other assets, with the related liabilities included in Accrued liabilities and Other long-term liabilities. Assets under
finance leases, which primarily represent computer equipment, are included in Property, plant and equipment, net, with
the related liabilities included in Short-term debt and current portion of long-term debt and Long-term debt on the
Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.
Operating lease assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent
our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease assets and liabilities are recognized at
the lease commencement date based on the estimated present value of lease payments over the lease term. We use
our estimated incremental borrowing rate in determining the present value of lease payments. Variable components of
the lease payments such as fair market value adjustments, utilities, and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred
and not included in determining the present value. Our lease terms include options to extend or terminate the lease
when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over
the lease term.
We have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components which are accounted for as a single lease
component.
Asset Retirement Obligations
We record all known asset retirement obligations for which the liability’s fair value can be reasonably estimated,
including certain asbestos removal, asset decommissioning and contractual lease restoration obligations. Recorded
amounts are not material.
We also have known conditional asset retirement obligations, such as certain asbestos remediation and asset
decommissioning activities to be performed in the future, that are not reasonably estimable due to insufficient
information about the timing and method of settlement of the obligation. Accordingly, these obligations have not been
recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements. A liability for these obligations will be recorded in the period when
sufficient information regarding timing and method of settlement becomes available to make a reasonable estimate of
the liability’s fair value. In addition, there may be conditional asset retirement obligations that we have not yet
discovered (e.g. asbestos may exist in certain buildings but we have not become aware of it through the normal course
of business), and therefore, these obligations also have not been included in the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangibles
Goodwill and other acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized, but are tested for impairment
annually and when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is more likely than not that an impairment
may exist. Our annual testing date is April 1.
64
Table of Contents
We test goodwill for impairment by performing a qualitative assessment or using a two-step impairment process. If we
choose to perform a qualitative assessment and determine it is more likely than not that the carrying value of the net
assets is more than the fair value of the related operations, the two-step impairment process is then performed;
otherwise, no further testing is required. For operations where the two-step impairment process is used, we first
compare the carrying value of net assets to the fair value of the related operations. If the fair value is determined to be
less than carrying value, a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment. In this process, a fair
value for goodwill is estimated, based in part on the fair value of the operations, and is compared to its carrying value.
The shortfall of the fair value below carrying value represents the amount of goodwill impairment.
Indefinite-lived intangibles consist of brand and trade names acquired in business combinations. We test these
intangibles for impairment by comparing their carrying value to current projections of discounted cash flows attributable
to the brand and trade names. Any excess carrying value over the amount of discounted cash flows represents the
amount of the impairment.
Our finite-lived acquired intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives as
follows: developed technology, from 2 to 14 years; product know-how, from 6 to 30 years; customer base, from 3 to 17
years; distribution rights, from 3 to 27 years; and other, from 1 to 32 years. We evaluate the potential impairment of
finite-lived acquired intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount
may not be recoverable. If the carrying value is no longer recoverable based upon the undiscounted future cash flows
of the asset, the amount of the impairment is the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the
asset.
Investments
Time deposits are held-to-maturity investments that are carried at cost.
Available-for-sale debt securities include commercial paper, U.S. government agency securities, and corporate debt
securities. Available-for-sale debt securities are recorded at fair value, and unrealized gains and losses are recorded,
net of tax, as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Realized gains and losses on available-for-
sale debt securities are recognized based on the specific identification method. Available-for-sale debt securities are
assessed for impairment quarterly.
The equity method of accounting is used to account for investments for which we have the ability to exercise significant
influence, but not control, over an investee. Significant influence is generally deemed to exist if we have an ownership
interest in the voting stock of an investee of between 20% and 50%. The cumulative earnings approach is used for
cash flow classification of distributions received from equity method investments.
Other Equity investments are recorded at fair value, with gains and losses recorded through net earnings. Equity
investments without readily determinable fair value are measured at cost, less impairments, plus or minus observable
price changes. Equity investments without readily determinable fair value are assessed for impairment quarterly.
We classify investment income and loss on our Consolidated Statements of Operations based on whether the
investment is operating or non-operating in nature. Operating investments align strategically and are integrated with our
operations. Earnings from operating investments, including our share of income or loss from equity method
investments, dividend income from other equity investments, and any impairments or gain/loss on the disposition of
these investments, are recorded in Income from operating investments, net. Non-operating investments are those we
hold for non-strategic purposes. Earnings from non-operating investments, including interest and dividends on
marketable securities, and any impairments or gain/loss on the disposition of these investments are recorded in Other
income/(loss), net.

Derivatives
All derivative instruments are recognized in the financial statements and measured at fair value regardless of the
purpose or intent of holding them. We use derivative instruments to principally manage a variety of market risks. For
derivatives designated as hedges of the exposure to changes in fair value of the recognized asset or liability or a firm
commitment (referred to as fair value hedges), the gain or loss is recognized in earnings in the period of change
together with the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the risk being hedged. The effect of that
accounting is to include in earnings the extent to which the hedge is not effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair
value. For our cash flow hedges, the derivative’s gain or loss is initially reported in comprehensive income and is
subsequently reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged forecasted transaction
affects earnings. We have agreements to purchase and sell aluminum to address long-term strategic sourcing
objectives and international business requirements. These agreements are derivatives for accounting purposes but are
not designated for hedge accounting treatment. We also hold certain derivative instruments for economic purposes that
are not designated for hedge accounting treatment. For these aluminum agreements and for other derivative
instruments not designated for hedge accounting treatment, the changes in their fair value are recorded in earnings
immediately.
Aircraft Valuation
Used aircraft under trade-in commitments and aircraft under repurchase commitments In conjunction with
signing a definitive agreement for the sale of new aircraft (Sale Aircraft), we have entered into trade-in commitments
with certain customers that give them the right to trade in used aircraft at a specified price upon the purchase of Sale
Aircraft. Additionally, we have entered into contingent repurchase commitments with certain customers wherein we
agree to repurchase the Sale Aircraft at a specified price, generally 10 to 15 years after delivery of the Sale Aircraft. Our
repurchase of the Sale Aircraft is contingent upon a future, mutually acceptable agreement for the sale of additional
new aircraft. If we execute an agreement for the sale of additional new aircraft, and if the customer exercises its right to
sell the Sale Aircraft to us, a contingent repurchase commitment would become a trade-in commitment. Our historical
experience is that contingent repurchase commitments infrequently become trade-in commitments.
Exposure related to trade-in commitments may take the form of:
(1)adjustments to revenue for the difference between the contractual trade-in price in the definitive agreement
and our best estimate of the fair value of the trade-in aircraft as of the date of such agreement, which would
be recognized upon delivery of the Sale Aircraft, and/or
(2)charges to cost of products for adverse changes in the fair value of trade-in aircraft that occur subsequent to
signing of a definitive agreement for Sale Aircraft but prior to the purchase of the used trade-in aircraft.
Estimates based on current aircraft values would be included in Accrued liabilities.
The fair value of trade-in aircraft is determined using aircraft-specific data such as model, age and condition, market
conditions for specific aircraft and similar models, and multiple valuation sources. This process uses our assessment of
the market for each trade-in aircraft, which in most instances begins years before the return of the aircraft. There are
several possible markets in which we continually pursue opportunities to place used aircraft. These markets include,
but are not limited to, the resale market, which could potentially include the cost of long-term storage; the leasing
market, with the potential for refurbishment costs to meet the leasing customer’s requirements; or the scrap market.
Trade-in aircraft valuation varies significantly depending on which market we determine is most likely for each aircraft.
On a quarterly basis, we update our valuation analysis based on the actual activities associated with placing each
aircraft into a market or using current published third-party aircraft valuations based on the type and age of the aircraft,
adjusted for individual attributes and known conditions.
66
Table of Contents
Used aircraft acquired by the Commercial Airplanes segment are included in Inventories at the lower of cost or net
realizable value as it is our intent to sell these assets. To mitigate costs and enhance marketability, aircraft may be
placed on operating lease. While on operating lease, the assets are included in Customer financing.
Customer financing Customer financing includes operating lease equipment, notes receivable, and sales-type/finance
leases. Sales-type/finance leases are treated as receivables, and allowances for losses are established as necessary.
We assess the fair value of the assets we own, including equipment under operating leases, assets held for sale or re-
lease, and collateral underlying receivables, to determine if their fair values are less than the related assets’ carrying
values. Differences between carrying values and fair values of sales-type/finance leases and notes and other
receivables, as determined by collateral value, are considered in determining the allowance for losses on receivables.
We use a median calculated from published collateral values from multiple third-party aircraft value publications based
on the type and age of the aircraft to determine the fair value of aircraft. Under certain circumstances, we apply
judgment based on the attributes of the specific aircraft or equipment, usually when the features or use of the aircraft
vary significantly from the more generic aircraft attributes covered by outside publications.
Impairment review for assets under operating leases and held for sale or re-lease We evaluate for impairment
assets under operating lease or assets held for sale or re-lease when events or changes in circumstances indicate that
the expected undiscounted cash flow from the asset may be less than the carrying value. We use various assumptions
when determining the expected undiscounted cash flow, including our intentions for how long we will hold an asset
subject to operating lease before it is sold, the expected future lease rates, lease terms, residual value of the asset,
periods in which the asset may be held in preparation for a follow-on lease, maintenance costs, remarketing costs and
the remaining economic life of the asset. We record assets held for sale at the lower of carrying value or fair value less
costs to sell.
When we determine that impairment is indicated for an asset, the amount of impairment expense recorded is the
excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the asset.
Allowance for losses on customer financing receivables We record the potential impairment of customer financing
receivables in a valuation account, the balance of which is an accounting estimate of probable but unconfirmed losses.
The allowance for losses on receivables relates to two components of receivables: (a) receivables that are evaluated
individually for impairment and (b) all other receivables.
We determine a receivable is impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be
unable to collect amounts due according to the original contractual terms of the receivable agreement, without regard to
any subsequent restructurings. Factors considered in assessing collectability include, but are not limited to, a
customer’s extended delinquency, requests for restructuring and filings for bankruptcy. We determine a specific
impairment allowance based on the difference between the carrying value of the receivable and the estimated fair value
of the related collateral we would expect to realize.
We review the adequacy of the allowance attributable to the remaining receivables (after excluding receivables subject
to a specific impairment allowance) by assessing both the collateral exposure and the applicable cumulative default
rate. Collateral exposure for a particular receivable is the excess of the carrying value of the receivable over the fair
value of the related collateral. A receivable with an estimated fair value in excess of the carrying value is considered to
have no collateral exposure. The applicable cumulative default rate is determined using two components: customer
credit ratings and weighted average remaining contract term. Internally assigned credit ratings, our credit quality
indicator, are determined for
67
Table of Contents
each customer in the portfolio. Those ratings are updated based upon public information and information obtained
directly from our customers.
We have entered into agreements with certain customers that would entitle us to look beyond the specific collateral
underlying the receivable for purposes of determining the collateral exposure as described above. Should the proceeds
from the sale of the underlying collateral asset resulting from a default condition be insufficient to cover the carrying
value of our receivable (creating a shortfall condition), these agreements would, for example, permit us to take the
actions necessary to sell or retain certain other assets in which the customer has an equity interest and use the
proceeds to cover the shortfall.
Each quarter we review customer credit ratings, published historical credit default rates for different rating categories,
and multiple third-party aircraft value publications as a basis to validate the reasonableness of the allowance for losses
on receivables. There can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from estimates or that the consideration of
these factors in the future will not result in an increase or decrease to the allowance for losses on receivables.
Warranties
In conjunction with certain product sales, we provide warranties that cover factors such as non-conformance to
specifications and defects in material and design. The majority of our warranties are issued by our Commercial
Airplanes segment. Generally, aircraft sales are accompanied by a 3 to 4-year standard warranty for systems,
accessories, equipment, parts, and software manufactured by us or manufactured to certain standards under our
authorization. These warranties are included in the programs’ estimate at completion. On occasion we have made
commitments beyond the standard warranty obligation to correct fleet-wide major issues of a particular model, resulting
in additional accrued warranty expense. Warranties issued by our BDS segment principally relate to sales of military
aircraft and weapons systems. These sales are generally accompanied by a six month to two-year warranty period and
cover systems, accessories, equipment, parts, and software manufactured by us to certain contractual specifications.
Estimated costs related to standard warranties are recorded in the period in which the related product delivery occurs.
The warranty liability recorded at each balance sheet date reflects the estimated number of months of warranty
coverage outstanding for products delivered times the average of historical monthly warranty payments, as well as
additional amounts for certain major warranty issues that exceed a normal claims level. Estimated costs of these
additional warranty issues are considered changes to the initial liability estimate.
We provide guarantees to certain commercial airplane customers which include compensation provisions for failure to
meet specified aircraft performance targets. We account for these performance guarantees as warranties. The
estimated liability for these warranties is based on known and anticipated operational characteristics and forecasted
customer operation of the aircraft relative to contractually specified performance targets, and anticipated settlements
when contractual remedies are not specified. Estimated payments are recorded as a reduction of revenue at delivery of
the related aircraft. We have agreements that require certain suppliers to compensate us for amounts paid to
customers for failure of supplied equipment to meet specified performance targets. Claims against suppliers under
these agreements are included in Inventories and recorded as a reduction in Cost of products at delivery of the related
aircraft. These performance warranties and claims against suppliers are included in the programs’ estimate at
completion.
Supplier Penalties
We record an accrual for supplier penalties when an event occurs that makes it probable that a supplier penalty will be
incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable. Until an event occurs, we fully anticipate accepting all products
procured under production-related contracts.
68
Table of Contents
Guarantees
We record a liability in Accrued liabilities for the fair value of guarantees that are issued or modified after December 31,
2002. For credit guarantees, the liability is equal to the present value of the expected loss. We determine the expected
loss by multiplying the creditor’s default rate by the guarantee amount reduced by the expected recovery, if applicable,
for each future period the credit guarantee will be outstanding. If at inception of a guarantee, we determine there is a
probable related contingent loss, we will recognize a liability for the greater of (a) the fair value of the guarantee as
described above or (b) the probable contingent loss amount.
Standards Issued and Not Yet Implemented
In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses
(Topic 326). The new standard is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019. The standard
replaces the incurred loss impairment methodology under current GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected
credit losses and requires the use of a forward-looking expected credit loss model for accounts receivables, loans, and
other financial instruments. The standard requires a modified retrospective approach through a cumulative-effect
adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective. We
plan to adopt the new credit loss standard effective January 1, 2020. We do not expect the new credit loss standard to
have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
Note 2 – Acquisitions and Joint Ventures
Strategic Partnership with Embraer
During the first quarter of 2019, we entered into definitive transaction documents with respect to a strategic partnership
with Embraer S.A. (Embraer). The partnership contemplates that the parties enter into a joint venture comprising the
commercial aircraft and services operations of Embraer, in which Boeing will acquire an 80 percent ownership stake for
$4,200, as well as a joint venture to promote and develop new markets for the multi-mission, medium airlift C-390
Millennium, in which Boeing will hold a 49 percent ownership stake.
Embraer shareholders approved the transaction, which remains subject to regulatory approvals and other customary
closing conditions. We are actively engaged with the European Commission and have obtained unconditional
clearance to close in all other required jurisdictions, including the United States, China, and Japan. In Brazil, the
Administrative Council for Economic Defense (CADE)’s General-Superintendence (SG) has provided unconditional
approval; the decision will become final in mid-February unless a review is requested by CADE Commissioners. We
continue to be engaged with the European Commission as it progresses its Phase II investigation of the transaction.
Pending timely resolution of the remaining regulatory approvals, the transaction is expected to close in the first half of
2020. If the transaction is not completed due to failure to obtain antitrust approvals, we would be required to pay a
termination fee of $100.

KLX Inc.
On October 9, 2018, we acquired all the outstanding shares of KLX Inc. (KLX). KLX is a global provider of aviation
parts and services in the aerospace industry. Its capabilities include distribution and supply chain services. The KLX
acquisition is intended to accelerate growth in our services business by allowing Boeing to offer commercial, defense,
business and general aviation customers a broader range of offerings. The results of KLX’s operations have been
included in our Global Services segment from the acquisition date. KLX’s revenues and earnings from operations from
October 9, 2018 through December 31, 2018 were $356 and $50.
The final allocation of the purchase price was as follows:
Cash and cash equivalents $225
Accounts receivable 260
Inventories 1,298
Other current assets 43
Property, plant & equipment 36
Goodwill 2,056
Intangible assets 963
Other assets 78
Current liabilities (350)
Other long-term liabilities (113)
Long-term debt (1,210)
Total net assets acquired $3,286
The goodwill has been allocated to the Global Services and Commercial Airplanes segments based on revenue
synergies expected to be realized from the integration of KLX’s products and services and expected cost synergies
primarily resulting from the consolidation of procurement spending and functional support. Approximately $533 of the
acquired goodwill and intangible assets is deductible for tax purposes. The acquired intangible assets primarily relate to
customer and supplier relationships and have a weighted-average useful life of 17.5 years.

Note 4 – Earnings Per Share
Basic and diluted earnings per share are computed using the two-class method, which is an earnings allocation method
that determines earnings per share for common shares and participating securities. The undistributed earnings are
allocated between common shares and participating securities as if all earnings had been distributed during the period.
Participating securities and common shares have equal rights to undistributed earnings.
Basic earnings per share is calculated by taking net earnings, less earnings available to participating securities, divided
by the basic weighted average common shares outstanding.
Diluted earnings per share is calculated by taking net earnings, less earnings available to participating securities,
divided by the diluted weighted average common shares outstanding.
The elements used in the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share were as follows:
(In millions - except per share amounts)    
Years ended December 31, 2019 2018 2017
Net (loss)/earnings ($636) $10,460 $8,458

Diluted (1.12) 17.85 13.85
(1) Diluted (loss)/earnings per share includes any dilutive impact of stock options, restricted stock units, performance-
based restricted stock units and performance awards.

Table of Contents
As a result of incurring a net loss for the year ended December 31, 2019, potential common shares of 4.1 million were
excluded from diluted loss per share because the effect would have been antidilutive. In addition, the following table
includes the number of shares that may be dilutive potential common shares in the future. These shares were not
included in the computation of diluted (loss)/earnings per share because the effect was either antidilutive or the
performance condition was not met.

(1) In the fourth quarter of 2019, we recorded a tax benefit of $371 related to the settlement of state tax audits
spanning 15 tax years. In the third quarter of 2018, we recorded a tax benefit of $412 related to the settlement of
the 2013-2014 federal tax audit.
(2) On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) was enacted. The TCJA revised the U.S. corporate
income tax by, among other things, lowering the rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, implementing a
territorial tax system and imposing a one-time tax on deemed repatriated earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries. The
TCJA also enacted provisions which effectively apply a lower U.S. tax rate to intangible income derived from
serving non-U.S. markets. In 2019 and 2018, we recorded tax benefits related to foreign derived intangible income
of $229 and $549.
(3) In 2019, 2018 and 2017, we recorded excess tax benefits related to employee share-based payments of $180,
$181 and $207, respectively.
(4) In accordance with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (SAB 118), in the
fourth quarter of 2017, we recorded provisional tax benefits of $1,430 related to the remeasurement of our net U.S.
deferred tax liabilities to reflect the reduction in the corporate tax rate and a provisional tax expense of $159 related
to tax on non-U.S. activities resulting from the TCJA. During the fourth quarter of 2018 and in accordance with SAB
118, the Company completed its accounting for the provisional amounts recognized at December 31, 2017 and
recorded an incremental benefit related to refinements to these provisional amounts which was not significant.

Table of Contents
Significant components of our deferred tax assets/(liabilities) at December 31 were as follows:
 2019 2018
Inventory and long-term contract methods of income recognition ($6,048) ($5,422)
Pension benefits 3,495 3,344

(1)  Of the deferred tax asset for net operating loss and credit carryovers, $251 expires on or before December 31,
2039 and $344 may be carried over indefinitely.
(2)  Included in the net deferred tax assets/(liabilities) as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 are deferred tax assets in the
amounts of $4,589 and $4,275 related to Accumulated other comprehensive loss.
Net deferred tax assets/(liabilities) at December 31 were as follows:
2019 2018
Deferred tax assets $10,722 $8,835
Deferred tax liabilities (10,334) (10,194)
Valuation allowance (118) (93)
Net deferred tax assets/(liabilities) $270 ($1,452)
The deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if, based upon available evidence, it is more likely than
not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
The TCJA one-time repatriation tax and Global Intangible Low Tax Income liabilities effectively taxed the undistributed
earnings previously deferred from U.S. income taxes. We have not provided for foreign withholding tax on the
undistributed earnings from our non-U.S. subsidiaries because such earnings are considered to be indefinitely
reinvested. If such earnings were to be distributed, any foreign withholding tax would not be significant.
As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the amounts accrued for the payment of income tax-related interest and penalties
included in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position were not significant. The amounts of interest included in
the Consolidated Statements of Operations were not significant for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and
2017.

Unrecognized tax benefits – December 31 $1,476 $2,412 $1,736
As of December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits was $1,476, $2,412 and
$1,736, respectively, of which $1,287, $1,405 and $1,568 would affect the effective tax rate, if recognized. As of
December 31, 2019, these amounts are primarily associated with the amount of research tax credits claimed,
uncertainties in the TCJA, tax basis adjustments and the U.S. manufacturing activity tax benefit.
Federal income tax audits have been settled for all years prior to 2015. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) began the
2015-2017 federal tax audit in the first quarter of 2019. We are also subject to examination in major state and
international jurisdictions for the 2007-2018 tax years. We believe appropriate provisions for all outstanding tax issues
have been made for all jurisdictions and all open years.
Audit outcomes and the timing of audit settlements are subject to significant uncertainty. It is reasonably possible that
within the next 12 months unrecognized tax benefits related to federal matters under audit may decrease by up to $710
based on current estimates.

Note 8 – Contracts with Customers
Unbilled receivables decreased from $10,025 at December 31, 2018 to $9,043 at December 31, 2019, primarily driven
by timing of billings at BDS and BGS.
Advances and progress billings increased from $50,676 at December 31, 2018 to $51,551 at December 31, 2019,
primarily driven by advances on orders received in excess of revenue recognized at BDS, BGS, and BCA.
Revenues recognized for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 from amounts recorded as Advances and
progress billings at the beginning of each year were $16,778 and $24,737.
Certain commercial airplane customers are experiencing liquidity issues and seeking additional capital. Should these
customers fail to address their liquidity issues, accounts receivable, unbilled receivables and certain inventory could
become impaired. In addition we would have to remove contracts related to these customers from backlog and
remarket any undelivered aircraft.
The following table summarizes our contract assets under long-term contracts that were unbillable or related to
outstanding claims as of December 31:
 Unbilled  Claims
 2019 2018 2019 2018
Current $6,931 $7,178 $9 $1
Expected to be collected after one year 2,112 2,847 14 2
Total $9,043 $10,025 $23 $3
Unbilled receivables related to commercial customer incentives expected to be collected after one year were $211 and
$150 at December 31, 2019 and 2018. Unbilled receivables related to claims are items that we believe are earned, but
are subject to uncertainty concerning their determination or ultimate realization.
Note 9 – Customer Financing
Customer financing primarily relates to our BCC segment. Customer financing consisted of the following at December
31:
 2019 2018
Financing receivables:   
Investment in sales-type/finance leases $1,029 $1,125
Notes 443 730
Total financing receivables 1,472 1,855

Minimum lease payments receivable $799 $908
Estimated residual value of leased assets 393 425
Unearned income (163) (208)
Total $1,029 $1,125
Operating lease equipment primarily includes large commercial jet aircraft.
Financing receivable balances evaluated for impairment at December 31 were as follows:
 2019 2018
Individually evaluated for impairment $400 $409
Collectively evaluated for impairment 1,072 1,446
Total financing receivables $1,472 $1,855
We determine a receivable is impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be
unable to collect amounts due according to the original contractual terms. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, we
individually evaluated for impairment customer financing receivables of $400 and $409, of which $388 and $398 were
determined to be impaired. We recorded no allowance for losses on these impaired receivables as the collateral values
exceeded the carrying values of the receivables.
Income recognition is generally suspended for financing receivables at the date full recovery of income and principal
becomes not probable. Income is recognized when financing receivables become contractually current and
performance is demonstrated by the customer. The average recorded investment in impaired financing receivables for
the year ended December 31, 2019 was $392, and the related interest income was insignificant.
The change in the allowance for losses on financing receivables for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and
2017, consisted of the following:
 2019 2018 2017
Beginning balance - January 1 ($9) ($12) ($10)
Customer financing valuation benefit/(cost) 1 3 (2)
Ending balance - December 31 ($8) ($9) ($12)
Collectively evaluated for impairment ($8) ($9) ($12)
The adequacy of the allowance for losses is assessed quarterly. Three primary factors influencing the level of our
allowance for losses on customer financing receivables are customer credit ratings, default rates and collateral values.
We assign internal credit ratings for all customers and determine the creditworthiness of each customer based upon
publicly available information and information obtained directly from our customers. Our rating categories are
comparable to those used by the major credit rating agencies.
79
Table of Contents
Our financing receivable balances at December 31 by internal credit rating category are shown below:
Rating categories 2019 2018
BBB $573 $883
BB 385 430
B 122 135
CCC 392 407
Total carrying value of financing receivables $1,472 $1,855
At December 31, 2019, our allowance related to receivables with ratings of B, BB and BBB. We applied default rates
that averaged 22.1%, 5.3% and 0.6%, respectively, to the exposure associated with those receivables.
Customer Financing Exposure
Customer financing is collateralized by security in the related asset. The value of the collateral is closely tied to
commercial airline performance and overall market conditions and may be subject to reduced valuation with market
decline. Declines in collateral values could result in asset impairments, reduced finance lease income, and an increase
in the allowance for losses. Our customer financing collateral is concentrated in 747-8 and out-of-production aircraft.
Generally, out-of-production aircraft have experienced greater collateral value declines than in-production aircraft.
The majority of customer financing carrying values are concentrated in the following aircraft models at December 31:
 2019 2018
717 Aircraft ($124 and $204 accounted for as operating leases) $736 $918
747-8 Aircraft ($130 and $132 accounted for as operating leases) 475 477
737 Aircraft ($240 and $263 Accounted for as operating leases) 263 290
777 Aircraft ($236 and $60 accounted for as operating leases) 240 68
MD-80 Aircraft (Accounted for as sales-type finance leases) 186 204
757 Aircraft ($22 and $24 accounted for as operating leases) 182 200
747-400 Aircraft ($31 and $45 Accounted for as operating leases) 90 116
As part of selected lease transactions, Boeing may provide incentives to commercial customers. At December 31,
2018, Customer Financing included $250 of lease incentives with one customer that experienced liquidity issues. In the
first quarter of 2019, we concluded that these lease incentives were impaired and recorded a charge of $250.
Charges related to customer financing asset impairment for the years ended December 31 were as follows:
 2019 2018 2017
Boeing Capital $53 $1 $13
Other Boeing 217 38 30
Total $270 $39 $43

Note 12 – Other Assets
Sea Launch
At December 31, 2019 and 2018, Other assets included $244 of receivables related to our former investment in the
Sea Launch venture which became payable by certain Sea Launch partners following Sea Launch’s bankruptcy filing in
June 2009. The net amounts owed to Boeing by each of the partners are as follows: S.P. Koroley Rocket and Space
Corporation Energia of Russia (RSC Energia) – $111, PO Yuzhnoye Mashinostroitelny Zavod of Ukraine – $89 and KB
Yuzhnoye of Ukraine – $44.
In 2013, we filed an action in the United States District Court for the Central District of California seeking
reimbursement from the other Sea Launch partners. In 2016, the United States District Court for the Central District of
California issued a judgment in favor of Boeing. Later that year, we reached an agreement which we believe will enable
us to recover the outstanding receivable balance from RSC Energia over the next several years. In the fourth quarter of
2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the decision of the U.S. District Court. We continue to
pursue collection efforts against the former Ukrainian partners in connection with the court judgment. We continue to
believe the partners have the financial wherewithal to pay and intend to pursue vigorously all of our rights and
remedies. In the event we are unable to secure reimbursement from RSC Energia and the Ukrainian Sea Launch
partners, we could incur additional charges.

737 MAX Grounding
On March 13, 2019, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued an order to suspend operations of all 737 MAX
aircraft in the U.S. and by U.S. aircraft operators following two fatal 737 MAX accidents. Non-U.S. civil aviation
authorities have issued directives to the same effect. Deliveries of the 737 MAX have been suspended until clearance
is granted by the appropriate regulatory authorities. In addition, multiple legal actions have been filed against us as a
result of the accidents. We also are fully cooperating with U.S. government investigations related to the accidents and
the 737 MAX program, including investigations by the U.S. Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange
Commission. We cannot reasonably estimate a range of loss, if any, not covered by available insurance that may result
given the ongoing status of these law suits, investigations and inquiries.
We have developed software and pilot training updates for the 737 MAX and continue to work with the FAA and non-
U.S. civil aviation authorities to complete remaining steps toward certification and readiness for return to service
including addressing their questions on the software updates and how pilots will interact with the airplane controls and
displays in different flight scenarios. We have assumed that computer and simulator training will be required and as a
result, we have provisioned for certain training costs.
84
Table of Contents
Prior to the grounding, the 737 production rate was 52 per month and we had planned to increase the rate to 57 per
month during 2019. Beginning in the second quarter of 2019, we reduced the production rate to 42 per month. We have
continued to produce at a rate of 42 per month through December 2019, which has resulted in approximately 400
airplanes in inventory as of December 31, 2019. In December 2019, we announced the temporary suspension of 737
MAX production beginning in January 2020 due to a number of factors, including the 737 MAX grounding continuing
longer than expected, our decision to prioritize delivery of stored aircraft, and uncertainty about the timing and
conditions of return to service and global training approvals. We have assumed that we will resume 737 MAX aircraft
production at low rates in 2020 as timing and conditions of return to service are better understood, and then we expect
to gradually increase to previously planned production rates over the next few years. We have assumed that regulatory
approval will enable 737 MAX deliveries to resume during mid-2020. The cumulative impacts of changes to
assumptions regarding timing of return to service and timing of planned production rates and deliveries have increased
the estimated costs to produce and deliver aircraft included in the current accounting quantity by approximately $6,300,
which will be recorded in program inventory. This will result in lower 737 program margins in future periods after
deliveries resume. In addition, the suspension of 737 MAX production and abnormally low production rates once
production resumes will result in approximately $4,000 of abnormal production costs during 2020 and 2021 that will be
expensed as incurred.
We are working with our customers to minimize the impact to their operations from grounded and undelivered aircraft.
During the second quarter of 2019, we recorded an earnings charge (reduction in revenue) and a corresponding liability
of $6,110 in connection with estimated potential concessions and other considerations to customers for disruptions
related to the 737 MAX grounding and associated delivery delays. We have insurance coverage for up to $500 of costs
arising due to grounded aircraft and have received $500 from our insurance carriers, which partially offset the earnings
charges. We continue to reassess the liability for estimated potential concessions and other considerations to
customers on a quarterly basis, and in the third and fourth quarters of 2019, we recorded additional charges totaling
$2,649. This reassessment includes updating estimates to reflect revised return to service and updated delivery and
production rate assumptions, as well as latest information based on engagements with 737 MAX customers. The
liability represents our current best estimate of future concessions and other considerations to customers, and is
necessarily based on a series of assumptions.
The following table summarizes changes in the 737 MAX customer concessions and other considerations liability
during 2019.
 2019
Beginning balance – January 1
Initial liability recorded in the second quarter of 2019 $6,110
Reductions for payments made (1,237)
Reductions for concessions and other in-kind considerations (133)
Changes in estimates 2,649
Ending balance – December 31 $7,389
We have also recorded additional expenses of $328 as a result of the 737 MAX grounding. These expenses include
costs related to storage, pilot training and software updates.
The FAA and other non-U.S. civil aviation authorities will determine the timing and conditions of return to service. Our
assumptions reflect our current best estimate, but actual timing and conditions of return to service and resumption of
deliveries could differ from this estimate, the effect of which could be material. We are unable at this time to reasonably
estimate potential future additional financial impacts or a range of loss, if any, due to continued uncertainties related to
the timing and conditions of return to service, future changes to the production rate, supply chain impacts or the results
of negotiations with particular customers. Any such impacts, including any changes in our estimates, could have a
material adverse effect on our
85
Table of Contents
financial position, results of operations, and/or cash flows. For example, we expect that, in the event that we are unable
to resume aircraft deliveries consistent with our assumptions, the continued absence of revenue, earnings, and cash
flows associated with 737 MAX deliveries would continue to have the most material impact on our operating results. In
the event that future production rate increases occur at a slower rate or take longer than we are currently assuming we
expect that the growth in inventory and other cash flow impacts associated with production would decrease. However,
while any prolonged production suspension or delays in planned production rate increases could mitigate the impact on
our liquidity it could significantly increase the overall expected costs to produce aircraft included in the accounting
quantity, which would reduce 737 program margins and/or increase abnormal production costs in the future.
737NG Structure (Pickle Fork)
During the third quarter of 2019, we detected cracks in the "pickle forks," a component of the structure connecting the
wings to the fuselages, of three 737-800NGs we were converting into freighters. We notified the FAA, which issued a
directive requiring that 737NG airplanes with over 30,000 flight cycles be inspected for this condition by October 10,
2019, and that airplanes with over 22,600 flight cycles be inspected over the next 1,000 flight cycles. To date, all
airplanes with over 30,000 flight cycles and approximately half of the airplanes with over 22,600 flights cycles have
been inspected and this condition has been found on a small percentage of aircraft, and those aircraft will be repaired.
A small percentage of airplanes with fewer than 22,600 flight cycles have also been inspected. We have estimated the
number of aircraft that will have to be repaired in the future and provisioned for the estimated costs of completing the
repairs. We recognized charges of $135 in 2019 for current and projected future aircraft repairs. However, we cannot
estimate a range of reasonably possible losses, if any, in excess of amounts recognized due to the ongoing nature of
the inspections and repairs and pending the completion of investigations into the cause of the condition.
Environmental
The following table summarizes environmental remediation activity during the years ended December 31, 2019 and
2018.
 2019 2018
Beginning balance – January 1 $555 $524
Reductions for payments made (47) (37)
Changes in estimates 62 68
Ending balance – December 31 $570 $555
The liabilities recorded represent our best estimate or the low end of a range of reasonably possible costs expected to
be incurred to remediate sites, including operation and maintenance over periods of up to 30 years. It is reasonably
possible that we may incur charges that exceed these recorded amounts because of regulatory agency orders and
directives, changes in laws and/or regulations, higher than expected costs and/or the discovery of new or additional
contamination. As part of our estimating process, we develop a range of reasonably possible alternate scenarios that
includes the high end of a range of reasonably possible cost estimates for all remediation sites for which we have
sufficient information based on our experience and existing laws and regulations. There are some potential remediation
obligations where the costs of remediation cannot be reasonably estimated. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, the high
end of the estimated range of reasonably possible remediation costs exceeded our recorded liabilities by $1,077 and
$796.

Commercial Aircraft Commitments
In conjunction with signing definitive agreements for the sale of new aircraft (Sale Aircraft), we have entered into trade-
in commitments with certain customers that give them the right to trade in used aircraft at a specified price upon the
purchase of Sale Aircraft. The probability that trade-in commitments will be exercised is determined by using both
quantitative information from valuation sources and qualitative information from other sources. The probability of
exercise is assessed quarterly, or as events trigger a change, and takes into consideration the current economic and
airline industry environments. Trade-in commitments, which can be terminated by mutual consent with the customer,
may be exercised only during the period specified in the agreement, and require advance notice by the customer.
Trade-in commitment agreements at December 31, 2019 have expiration dates from 2020 through 2026. At December
31, 2019 and 2018, total contractual trade-in commitments were $1,407 and $1,519. As of December 31, 2019 and
2018, we estimated that it was probable we would be obligated to perform on certain of these commitments with net
amounts payable to customers totaling $711 and $522 and the fair value of the related trade-in aircraft was $678 and
$485.
Financing Commitments
Financing commitments related to aircraft on order, including options and those proposed in sales campaigns, and
refinancing of delivered aircraft, totaled $13,377 and $19,462 as of December 31, 2019 and 2018. The estimated
earliest potential funding dates for these commitments as of December 31, 2019 are as follows:
 Total
2020 $3,506
2021 2,981
2022 1,343
2023 2,163
2024 1,407
Thereafter 1,977
 $13,377
As of December 31, 2019, all of these financing commitments relate to customers we believe have less than
investment-grade credit. We have concluded that no reserve for future potential losses is required for these financing
commitments based upon the terms, such as collateralization and interest rates, under which funding would be
provided.
87
Table of Contents
Funding Commitments
We have commitments to make additional capital contributions of $246 to joint ventures over the next eight years.
Standby Letters of Credit and Surety Bonds
We have entered into standby letters of credit and surety bonds with financial institutions primarily relating to the
guarantee of our future performance on certain contracts. Contingent liabilities on outstanding letters of credit
agreements and surety bonds aggregated approximately $3,769 and $3,761 as of December 31, 2019 and 2018.
Company Owned Life Insurance
McDonnell Douglas Corporation insured its executives with Company Owned Life Insurance (COLI), which are life
insurance policies with a cash surrender value. Although we do not use COLI currently, these obligations from the
merger with McDonnell Douglas are still a commitment at this time. We have loans in place to cover costs paid or
incurred to carry the underlying life insurance policies. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the cash surrender value
was $448 and $466 and the total loans were $431 and $447. As we have the right to offset the loans against the cash
surrender value of the policies, we present the net asset in Other assets on the Consolidated Statements of Financial
Position as of December 31, 2019 and 2018.
United States Government Defense Environment Overview
The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019 raised the Budget Control Act limits on federal discretionary defense and non-
defense spending for fiscal years 2020 and 2021 (FY20 and FY21), reducing budget uncertainty and the risk of
sequestration. The consolidated appropriations acts for FY20, enacted in December 2019, provided FY20
appropriations for government departments and agencies, including the United States Department of Defense (U.S.
DoD), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the FAA.
The enacted FY20 appropriations included funding for Boeing’s major programs, such as the F/A-18 Super Hornet, F-
15EX, CH-47 Chinook, AH-64 Apache, V-22 Osprey, KC-46A Tanker, P-8 Poseidon and Space Launch System.
However, there continues to be uncertainty with respect to future program-level appropriations for the U.S. DoD and
other government agencies, including NASA. Future budget cuts or investment priority changes, including changes
associated with the authorizations and appropriations process, could result in reductions, cancellations and/or delays of
existing contracts or programs. Any of these impacts could have a material effect on our results of operations, financial
position and/or cash flows.
BDS Fixed-Price Development Contracts
Fixed-price development work is inherently uncertain and subject to significant variability in estimates of the cost and
time required to complete the work. BDS fixed-price contracts with significant development work include Commercial
Crew, KC-46A Tanker, T-7A Red Hawk (formerly T-X Trainer), VC-25B Presidential Aircraft, MQ-25, and commercial
and military satellites. The operational and technical complexities of these contracts create financial risk, which could
trigger termination provisions, order cancellations or other financially significant exposure. Changes to cost and
revenue estimates could result in lower margins or material charges for reach-forward losses. For example, we have
recorded reach-forward losses of $148 on KC-46A Tanker and $489 on Commercial Crew in 2019. Moreover, our fixed-
price development programs remain subject to additional reach-forward losses if we experience further production,
technical or quality issues, schedule delays, or increased costs. 
88
Table of Contents
KC-46A Tanker
In 2011, we were awarded a contract from the U.S. Air Force (USAF) to design, develop, manufacture and deliver four
next generation aerial refueling tankers. This EMD contract is a fixed-price incentive fee contract and involves highly
complex designs and systems integration. Since 2016, the USAF has authorized five low rate initial production (LRIP)
lots for a total of 67 aircraft. The EMD contract and authorized LRIP lots are valued at approximately $15 billion.
At December 31, 2019, we had approximately $331 of capitalized precontract costs and $225 of potential termination
liabilities to suppliers.
Recoverable Costs on Government Contracts
Our final incurred costs for each year are subject to audit and review for allowability by the U.S. government, which can
result in payment demands related to costs they believe should be disallowed. We work with the U.S. government to
assess the merits of claims and where appropriate reserve for amounts disputed. If we are unable to satisfactorily
resolve disputed costs, we could be required to record an earnings charge and/or provide refunds to the U.S.
government.
Note 15 – Arrangements with Off-Balance Sheet Risk
We enter into arrangements with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business, primarily in the form of
guarantees.
The following table provides quantitative data regarding our third party guarantees. The maximum potential payments
represent a “worst-case scenario,” and do not necessarily reflect amounts that we expect to pay. Estimated proceeds
from collateral and recourse represent the anticipated values of assets we could liquidate or receive from other parties
to offset our payments under guarantees. The carrying amount of liabilities represents the amount included in Accrued
liabilities.

Contingent Repurchase Commitments The repurchase price specified in contingent repurchase commitments is
generally lower than the expected fair value at the specified repurchase date. Estimated proceeds from
collateral/recourse in the table above represent the lower of the contracted repurchase price or the expected fair value
of each aircraft at the specified repurchase date.
Indemnifications to ULA In 2006, we agreed to indemnify ULA through December 31, 2020 against potential non-
recoverability and non-allowability of $1,360 of Boeing Delta launch program inventory included in contributed assets
plus $1,860 of inventory subject to an inventory supply agreement which ends on March 31, 2021. See Note 7. ULA
has yet to consume $30 of contributed inventory.

Table of Contents
In June 2011, the Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA) notified ULA that it had determined that $271 of
deferred support costs are not recoverable under government contracts. In December 2011, the DCMA notified ULA of
the potential non-recoverability of an additional $114 of deferred production costs. ULA and Boeing believe that all
costs are recoverable and in November 2011, ULA filed a certified claim with the USAF for collection of deferred
support and production costs. The USAF issued a final decision denying ULA’s certified claim in May 2012. In 2012,
Boeing and ULA, through its subsidiary United Launch Services, filed a suit in the Court of Federal Claims seeking
recovery of the deferred support and production costs from the U.S. government, which subsequently asserted a
counterclaim for credits that it alleges were offset by deferred support cost invoices. We believe that the U.S.
government’s counterclaim is without merit. The discovery phase of the litigation completed in 2017. The parties have
since agreed to engage in alternative dispute resolution, and the court has stayed the litigation pending that process. If,
contrary to our belief, it is determined that some or all of the deferred support or production costs are not recoverable,
we could be required to record pre-tax losses up to $269 and make indemnification payments to ULA for up to $317 of
the costs questioned by the DCMA.
Other Indemnifications In conjunction with our sales of Electron Dynamic Devices, Inc. and Rocketdyne Propulsion
and Power businesses and our BCA facilities in Wichita, Kansas and Tulsa and McAlester, Oklahoma, we agreed to
indemnify, for an indefinite period, the buyers for costs relating to pre-closing environmental conditions and certain
other items. We are unable to assess the potential number of future claims that may be asserted under these
indemnifications, nor the amounts thereof (if any). As a result, we cannot estimate the maximum potential amount of
future payments under these indemnities and therefore, no liability has been recorded. To the extent that claims have
been made under these indemnities and/or are probable and reasonably estimable, liabilities associated with these
indemnities are included in the environmental liability disclosure in Note 14.
Credit Guarantees We have issued credit guarantees where we are obligated to make payments to a guaranteed
party in the event that the original lessee or debtor does not make payments or perform certain specified services.
Generally, these guarantees have been extended on behalf of guaranteed parties with less than investment-grade
credit and are collateralized by certain assets. Current outstanding credit guarantees expire through 2036.
Industrial Revenue Bonds
Industrial Revenue Bonds (IRB) issued by St. Louis County were used to finance the purchase and/or construction of
real and personal property at our St. Louis site. Tax benefits associated with IRBs include a twelve-year property tax
abatement and sales tax exemption from St. Louis County. We record these properties on our Consolidated Statements
of Financial Position. We have also purchased the IRBs and therefore are the bondholders as well as the
borrower/lessee of the properties purchased with the IRB proceeds. The liabilities and IRB assets are equal and are
reported net in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.
As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the assets and liabilities associated with the IRBs were $271.
Note 16 – Debt

totaled $5,442, after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses.
Interest incurred, including amounts capitalized, was $867, $624 and $541 for the years ended December 31, 2019,
2018 and 2017, respectively. Interest expense recorded by BCC is reflected as Boeing Capital interest expense on our
Consolidated Statements of Operations. Total Company interest payments were $973, $616 and $527 for the years
ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
We have $9,600 currently available under credit line agreements, of which $3,200 is a 364-day revolving credit facility
expiring in October 2020, $3,200 expires in October 2022, and $3,200 expires in October 2024. The 364-day credit
facility has a one-year term out option which allows us to extend the maturity of any borrowings one year beyond the
aforementioned expiration date. We continue to be in full compliance with all covenants contained in our debt or credit
facility agreements.

Note 17 – Postretirement Plans
The majority of our employees have earned benefits under defined benefit pension plans. Nonunion and the majority of
union employees that had participated in defined benefit pension plans transitioned to a company-funded defined
contribution retirement savings plan in 2016. Additional union employees transitioned to company-funded defined
contribution retirement savings plans effective January 1, 2019.
We fund our major pension plans through trusts. Pension assets are placed in trust solely for the benefit of the plans’
participants, and are structured to maintain liquidity that is sufficient to pay benefit obligations as well as to keep pace
over the long-term with the growth of obligations for future benefit payments.
We also have other postretirement benefits (OPB) other than pensions which consist principally of health care
coverage for eligible retirees and qualifying dependents, and to a lesser extent, life insurance to certain groups of
retirees. Retiree health care is provided principally until age 65 for approximately two-thirds of those participants who
are eligible for health care coverage. Certain employee groups, including
92
Table of Contents
employees covered by most United Auto Workers bargaining agreements, are provided lifetime health care coverage.
The funded status of the plans is measured as the difference between the plan assets at fair value and the projected
benefit obligation (PBO). We have recognized the aggregate of all overfunded plans in Other assets, and the aggregate
of all underfunded plans in either Accrued retiree health care or Accrued pension plan liability, net. The portion of the
amount by which the actuarial present value of benefits included in the PBO exceeds the fair value of plan assets,
payable in the next 12 months, is reflected in Accrued liabilities.
The components of net periodic benefit (income)/cost were as follows:

Table of Contents
The accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) for all pension plans was $75,787 and $69,376 at December 31, 2019 and
2018. Key information for our plans with ABO and PBO in excess of plan assets as of December 31 was as follows:

Projected benefit obligation $72,325 $68,354
Fair value of plan assets 55,907 52,894
Assumptions
The following assumptions, which are the weighted average for all plans, are used to calculate the benefit obligation at
December 31 of each year and the net periodic benefit cost for the subsequent year.
December 31, 2019 2018 2017
Discount rate:    
Pension 3.30% 4.20% 3.60%
Other postretirement benefits 3.00% 4.00% 3.30%
Expected return on plan assets 6.80% 6.80% 6.80%
Rate of compensation increase 4.30% 5.30% 5.30%
Interest crediting rates for cash balance plans 5.15% 5.15% 5.15%
The discount rate for each plan is determined based on the plans’ expected future benefit payments using a yield curve
developed from high quality bonds that are rated as Aa or better by at least half of the four rating agencies utilized as of
the measurement date. The yield curve is fitted to yields developed from bonds at various maturity points. Bonds with
the ten percent highest and the ten percent lowest yields are omitted. The present value of each plan’s benefits is
calculated by applying the discount rates to projected benefit cash flows.
The pension fund’s expected return on plan assets assumption is derived from a review of actual historical returns
achieved by the pension trust and anticipated future long-term performance of individual asset classes. While
consideration is given to recent trust performance and historical returns, the assumption represents a long-term,
prospective return. The expected return on plan assets component of the net periodic benefit cost for the upcoming
plan year is determined based on the expected return on plan assets assumption and the market-related value of plan
assets (MRVA). Since our adoption of the accounting standard for pensions in 1987, we have determined the MRVA
based on a five-year moving average of plan assets. As of December 31, 2019, the MRVA was approximately $3,674
less than the fair market value of assets.
Assumed health care cost trend rates were as follows:
December 31, 2019 2018 2017
Health care cost trend rate assumed next year 5.00% 5.50% 6.00%
Ultimate trend rate 4.50% 4.50% 4.50%
Year that trend reached ultimate rate 2021 2021 2021

Plan Assets
Investment Strategy The overall objective of our pension assets is to earn a rate of return over time to satisfy the
benefit obligations of the pension plans and to maintain sufficient liquidity to pay benefits and address other cash
requirements of the pension fund. Specific investment objectives for our long-term investment strategy include reducing
the volatility of pension assets relative to pension liabilities, achieving a competitive total investment return, achieving
diversification between and within asset classes and managing other risks. Investment objectives for each asset class
are determined based on specific risks and investment opportunities identified.
We periodically update our long-term, strategic asset allocations. We use various analytics to determine the optimal
asset mix and consider plan liability characteristics, liquidity characteristics, funding requirements, expected rates of
return and the distribution of returns. We identify investment benchmarks to evaluate performance for the asset classes
in the strategic asset allocation that are market-based and investable where possible. Actual allocations to each asset
class vary from target allocations due to periodic investment strategy changes, market value fluctuations, the length of
time it takes to fully implement investment allocation positions, and the timing of benefit payments and contributions.
Short-term investments and exchange-traded derivatives are used to rebalance the actual asset allocation to the target
asset allocation. The asset allocation is monitored and rebalanced periodically. The actual and target allocations by
asset class for the pension assets at December 31 were as follows:
 Actual Allocations Target Allocations
Asset Class 2019 2018 2019 2018
Fixed income 49% 48% 47% 47%
Global equity 29 28 29 29
Private equity 5 5 5 5
Real estate and real assets 8 9 9 9
Hedge funds 9 10 10 10
Total 100% 100% 100% 100%
Fixed income securities are invested primarily in a diversified portfolio of long duration instruments. Global equity
securities are invested in a diversified portfolio of U.S. and non-U.S. companies, across various industries and market
capitalizations.
Private equity investment vehicles are primarily limited partnerships (LPs) that mainly invest in U.S. and non-U.S.
leveraged buyout, venture capital and special situation strategies. Real estate and real assets include global private
investments that may be held through an investment in a limited partnership (LP) or other fund structures and publicly
traded investments (such as Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) in the case of real estate). Real estate includes, but
is not limited to, investments in office, retail, apartment and industrial properties. Real assets include, but are not limited
to, investments in natural resources (such as energy, farmland and timber), commodities and infrastructure.
Hedge fund investments seek to capitalize on inefficiencies identified across and within different asset classes or
markets. Hedge fund strategy types include, but are not limited to directional, event driven, relative value, long-short
and multi-strategy.
Investment managers are retained for explicit investment roles specified by contractual investment guidelines. Certain
investment managers are authorized to use derivatives, such as equity or bond futures, swaps, options and currency
futures or forwards. Derivatives are used to achieve the desired market exposure of a security or an index, transfer
value-added performance between asset classes, achieve the desired currency exposure, adjust portfolio duration or
rebalance the total portfolio to the target asset allocation.
96
Table of Contents
As a percentage of total pension assets, derivative net notional amounts were 4.3% and 4.4% for fixed income,
including to-be-announced mortgage-backed securities and treasury forwards, and 3.6% and 5.5% for global equity
and commodities at December 31, 2019 and 2018.
Risk Management In managing the pension assets, we review and manage risk associated with funded status risk,
interest rate risk, market risk, counterparty risk, liquidity risk and operational risk. Liability matching and asset class
diversification are central to our risk management approach and are integral to the overall investment strategy. Further,
asset classes are constructed to achieve diversification by investment strategy, by investment manager, by industry or
sector and by holding. Investment manager guidelines for publicly traded assets are specified and are monitored
regularly through the custodian. Credit parameters for counterparties have been established for managers permitted to
trade over-the-counter derivatives. Valuation is governed through several types of procedures, including reviews of
manager valuation policies, custodian valuation processes, pricing vendor practices, pricing reconciliation, and periodic,
security-specific valuation testing.

Fair Value Measurements The following table presents our plan assets using the fair value hierarchy as of December
31, 2019 and 2018. The fair value hierarchy has three levels based on the reliability of the inputs used to determine fair
value. Level 1 refers to fair values determined based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. Level 2
refers to fair values estimated using significant other observable inputs, and Level 3 includes fair values estimated
using significant unobservable inputs.

Table of Contents
Fixed income securities are primarily valued upon a market approach, using matrix pricing and considering a security’s
relationship to other securities for which quoted prices in an active market may be available, or an income approach,
converting future cash flows to a single present value amount. Inputs used in developing fair value estimates include
reported trades, broker quotes, benchmark yields, and base spreads.
Common/collective/pooled funds are typically common or collective trusts valued at their net asset values (NAVs) that
are calculated by the investment manager or sponsor of the fund and have daily or monthly liquidity. Derivatives
included in the table above are over-the-counter and are primarily valued using an income approach with inputs that
include benchmark yields, swap curves, cash flow analysis, rating agency data and interdealer broker rates. Exchange-
traded derivative positions are reported in accordance with changes in daily variation margin which is settled daily and
therefore reflected in the payables and receivables portion of the table.
Cash equivalents and other short-term investments (which are used to pay benefits) are held in a separate account
which consists of a commingled fund (with daily liquidity) and separately held short-term securities and cash
equivalents. All of the investments in this cash vehicle are valued daily using a market approach with inputs that include
quoted market prices for similar instruments. In the event a market price is not available for instruments with an original
maturity of one year or less, amortized cost is used as a proxy for fair value. Common and preferred stock equity
securities are primarily valued using a market approach based on the quoted market prices of identical instruments.
Private equity and private debt NAV valuations are based on the valuation of the underlying investments, which include
inputs such as cost, operating results, discounted future cash flows and market based comparable data. For those
investments reported on a one-quarter lagged basis (primarily LPs) we use NAVs, adjusted for subsequent cash flows
and significant events.
Real estate and real asset NAV valuations are based on valuation of the underlying investments, which include inputs
such as cost, discounted future cash flows, independent appraisals and market based comparable data. For those
investments reported on a one-quarter lagged basis (primarily LPs) NAVs are adjusted for subsequent cash flows and
significant events. Publicly traded REITs and infrastructure stocks are valued using a market approach based on
quoted market prices of identical instruments. Exchange-traded commodities futures positions are reported in
accordance with changes in daily variation margin which is settled daily and therefore reflected in the payables and
receivables portion of the table.
Hedge fund NAVs are generally based on the valuation of the underlying investments. This is primarily done by
applying a market or income valuation methodology depending on the specific type of security or instrument held.
Investments in private equity, private debt, real estate, real assets, and hedge funds are primarily calculated and
reported by the General Partner (GP), fund manager or third party administrator. Additionally, some investments in fixed
income and equity are made via commingled vehicles and are valued in a similar fashion. Pension assets invested in
commingled and limited partnership structures rely on the NAV of these investments as the practical expedient for the
valuations.

non-U.S. common and preferred stock equity securities still held at December 31, 2019 and 2018 were $1 and $0.
OPB Plan Assets The majority of OPB plan assets are invested in a balanced index fund which is comprised of
approximately 60% equities and 40% debt securities. The index fund is valued using a market approach based on the
quoted market price of an identical instrument (Level 1). The expected rate of return on these assets does not have a
material effect on the net periodic benefit cost.

Cash Flows
Contributions Required pension contributions under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), as well
as rules governing funding of our non-US pension plans, are not expected to be significant in 2020. We do not expect
to make discretionary contributions to our pension plans in 2020.
Estimated Future Benefit Payments The table below reflects the total pension benefits expected to be paid from the
plans or from our assets, including both our share of the benefit cost and the participants’ share of the cost, which is

Net other postretirement benefits $461 $452 $444 $432 $417 $1,774
Termination Provisions
Certain of the pension plans provide that, in the event there is a change in control of the Company which is not
approved by the Board of Directors and the plans are terminated within five years thereafter, the assets in the plan first
will be used to provide the level of retirement benefits required by ERISA, and then any surplus will be used to fund a
trust to continue present and future payments under the postretirement medical and life insurance benefits in our group
insurance benefit programs.
Should we terminate certain pension plans under conditions in which the plan’s assets exceed that plan’s obligations,
the U.S. government will be entitled to a fair allocation of any of the plan’s assets based on plan contributions that were
reimbursed under U.S. government contracts.
Defined Contribution Plans
We provide certain defined contribution plans to all eligible employees. The principal plans are the Company-sponsored
401(k) plans. The expense for these defined contribution plans was $1,533, $1,480 and $1,522 in 2019, 2018 and
2017, respectively.
Note 18 – Share-Based Compensation and Other Compensation Arrangements
Share-Based Compensation
Our 2003 Incentive Stock Plan, as amended and restated, permits awards of incentive and non-qualified stock options,
stock appreciation rights, restricted stock or units, performance shares, performance restricted stock or units,
performance units and other stock and cash-based awards to our employees, officers, directors, consultants, and
independent contractors. The aggregate number of shares of our stock authorized for issuance under the plan is
87,000,000.
Shares issued as a result of stock option exercises or conversion of stock unit awards will be funded out of treasury
shares, except to the extent there are insufficient treasury shares, in which case new shares will be issued. We believe
we currently have adequate treasury shares to satisfy these issuances during 2020.

Stock Options
We discontinued granting options in 2014, replacing them with performance-based restricted stock units. Options
granted through January 2014 had an exercise price equal to the fair market value of our stock on the date of grant and
expire ten years after the date of grant. The stock options vested over a period of three years and were fully vested as
of December 31, 2017.

December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.
Restricted Stock Units
In February 2019, 2018 and 2017, we granted to our executives 233,582, 260,730 and 523,835 restricted stock units
(RSUs) as part of our long-term incentive program with grant date fair values of $428.22, $361.13 and $178.72 per unit,
respectively. The RSUs granted under this program will vest and settle in common stock (on a one-for-one basis) on
the third anniversary of the grant date. If an executive terminates employment because of retirement, involuntary layoff,
disability, or death, the employee (or beneficiary) will receive a proration of stock units based on active employment
during the three-year service period. In all other cases, the RSUs will not vest and all rights to the stock units will
terminate. In addition to RSUs awarded under our long-term incentive program, we grant RSUs to certain executives
and employees to encourage retention or to reward various achievements. These RSUs are labeled other RSUs in the
table below. The fair values of all RSUs are estimated using the average of the high and low stock prices on the date of
grant.

Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units
Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units (PBRSUs) are stock units that pay out based on the Company’s total
shareholder return as compared to a group of peer companies over a three-year period. The award payout can range
from 0% to 200% of the initial PBRSU grant. PBRSUs granted in February 2017 and 2016 will not exceed 400% of the
initial value (excluding dividend equivalent credits). The PBRSUs granted under this program will vest at the payout
amount and settle in common stock (on a one-for-one basis) on the third anniversary of the grant date. If an executive
terminates employment because of retirement, involuntary layoff, disability, or death, the employee (or beneficiary)
remains eligible under the award and, if the award is earned, will receive a proration of stock units based on active
employment during the three-year service period. In all other cases, the PBRSUs will not vest and all rights to the stock
units will terminate.
In February 2019, 2018 and 2017, we granted to our executives 214,651, 241,284 and 492,273 PBRSUs as part of our
long-term incentive program. Compensation expense for the award is recognized over the three-year performance
period based upon the grant date fair value. The grant date fair values were estimated using a Monte-Carlo simulation
model with the assumptions presented below. The model includes no expected dividend yield as the units earn
dividend equivalents.

Other Compensation Arrangements
Performance Awards
Performance Awards are cash units that pay out based on the achievement of long-term financial goals at the end of a
three-year period. Each unit has an initial value of $100 dollars. The amount payable at the end of the three-year
performance period may be anywhere from $0 to $200 dollars per unit, depending on the Company’s performance
against plan for a three-year period. The Compensation Committee has the discretion to pay these awards in cash,
stock, or a combination of both after the three-year performance period. Compensation expense, based on the
estimated performance payout, is recognized ratably over the performance period.
During 2019, 2018 and 2017, we granted Performance Awards to our executives as part of our long-term incentive
program with the payout based on the achievement of financial goals for each three-year period following the grant
date. The minimum payout amount is $0 and the maximum amount we could be required to pay out for the 2019, 2018
and 2017 Performance Awards is $392, $355 and $325, respectively.
Deferred Compensation
The Company has deferred compensation plans which permit employees to defer a portion of their salary, bonus,
certain other incentive awards, and retirement contributions. Participants can diversify these amounts among 22
investment funds including a Boeing stock unit account.
Total expense related to deferred compensation was $174, $19 and $240 in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. As of
December 31, 2019 and 2018, the deferred compensation liability which is being marked to market was $1,779 and
$1,572.

Note 20 – Derivative Financial Instruments
Disclosures reflect the adoption of ASU 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815), in the first quarter of 2019. Prior
period amounts have not been restated.
Cash Flow Hedges
Our cash flow hedges include foreign currency forward contracts, commodity swaps and commodity purchase
contracts. We use foreign currency forward contracts to manage currency risk associated with certain transactions,
specifically forecasted sales and purchases made in foreign currencies. Our foreign currency contracts hedge
forecasted transactions through 2025. We use commodity derivatives, such as fixed-price purchase commitments and
swaps to hedge against potentially unfavorable price changes for items used in production. Our commodity contracts
hedge forecasted transactions through 2023.
Fair Value Hedges
Interest rate swaps under which we agree to pay variable rates of interest are designated as fair value hedges of fixed-
rate debt. The net change in fair value of the derivatives and the hedged items is reported in Boeing Capital interest
expense. As of December 31, 2019, there are no fair value hedges reported on the Consolidated Statements of
Financial Position.

Derivative Instruments Not Receiving Hedge Accounting Treatment
We have entered into agreements to purchase and sell aluminum to address long-term strategic sourcing objectives
and non-U.S. business requirements. These agreements are derivative instruments for accounting purposes. The
quantities of aluminum in these agreements offset and are priced at prevailing market prices. We also hold certain
foreign currency forward contracts which do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment.

foreign exchange cash flow hedging transactions recognized in Other income, net was a gain of $1 for the year ended
December 31, 2018.
Based on our portfolio of cash flow hedges, we expect to reclassify losses of $8 (pre-tax) out of Accumulated other
comprehensive loss into earnings during the next 12 months.
We have derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features. For foreign exchange contracts with original
maturities of at least five years, our derivative counterparties could require settlement if we default on our five-year
credit facility. For certain commodity contracts, our counterparties could require collateral posted in an amount
determined by our credit ratings. The fair value of foreign exchange and commodity contracts that have credit-risk-
related contingent features that are in a net liability position at December 31, 2019 was $19. At December 31, 2019,
there was no collateral posted related to our derivatives.

Note 21 – Fair Value Measurements
The fair value hierarchy has three levels based on the reliability of the inputs used to determine fair value. Level 1
refers to fair values determined based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. Level 2 refers to fair
values estimated using significant other observable inputs, and Level 3 includes fair values estimated using significant
unobservable inputs. The following table presents our assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a
recurring basis and are categorized using the fair value hierarchy.

Derivatives ($118) ($118) ($112) ($112)
Total liabilities ($118) ($118) ($112) ($112)
Money market funds, available-for-sale debt investments and equity securities are valued using a market approach
based on the quoted market prices or broker/dealer quotes of identical or comparable instruments.
Derivatives include foreign currency, commodity and interest rate contracts. Our foreign currency forward contracts are
valued using an income approach based on the present value of the forward rate less the contract rate multiplied by the
notional amount. Commodity derivatives are valued using an income approach based on the present value of the
commodity index prices less the contract rate multiplied by the notional amount. The fair value of our interest rate
swaps is derived from a discounted cash flow analysis based on the terms of the contract and the interest rate curve.
Certain assets have been measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level
3). The following table presents the nonrecurring losses recognized for the years ended December 31 due to long-lived
asset impairment, and the fair value and asset classification of the related assets as of the impairment date:

Table of Contents
Investments, Acquired intangible assets and Property, plant and equipment were primarily valued using an income
approach based on the discounted cash flows associated with the underlying assets. The fair value of the impaired
customer financing assets includes operating lease equipment and investments in sales type-leases/finance leases,
and is derived by calculating a median collateral value from a consistent group of third party aircraft value publications.
The values provided by the third party aircraft publications are derived from their knowledge of market trades and other
market factors. Management reviews the publications quarterly to assess the continued appropriateness and
consistency with market trends. Under certain circumstances, we adjust values based on the attributes and condition of
the specific aircraft or equipment, usually when the features or use of the aircraft vary significantly from the more
generic aircraft attributes covered by third party publications, or on the expected net sales price for the aircraft.
For Level 3 assets that were measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis during the year ended December 31, 2019,
the following table presents the fair value of those assets as of the measurement date, valuation techniques and related
unobservable inputs of those assets.

adjustments based on consideration of individual aircraft attributes and condition. The positive amount represents
the sum of all such upward adjustments.

Table of Contents
The fair values of notes receivable are estimated with discounted cash flow analysis using interest rates currently
offered on loans with similar terms to borrowers of similar credit quality. The fair value of our debt that is traded in the
secondary market is classified as Level 2 and is based on current market yields. For our debt that is not traded in the
secondary market, the fair value is classified as Level 2 and is based on our indicative borrowing cost derived from
dealer quotes or discounted cash flows. The fair values of our debt classified as Level 3 are based on discounted cash
flow models using the implied yield from similar securities. With regard to other financial instruments with off-balance
sheet risk, it is not practicable to estimate the fair value of our indemnifications and financing commitments because the
amount and timing of those arrangements are uncertain. Items not included in the above disclosures include cash,
restricted cash, time deposits and other deposits, commercial paper, money market funds, Accounts receivable,
Unbilled receivables, Other current assets, Accounts payable and long-term payables. The carrying values of those
items, as reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position, approximate their fair value at December 31,
2019 and 2018. The fair value of assets and liabilities whose carrying value approximates fair value is determined using
Level 2 inputs, with the exception of cash (Level 1).
Note 22 – Legal Proceedings
Various legal proceedings, claims and investigations related to products, contracts, employment and other matters are
pending against us.
In addition, we are subject to various U.S. government inquiries and investigations from which civil, criminal or
administrative proceedings could result or have resulted in the past. Such proceedings involve or could involve claims
by the government for fines, penalties, compensatory and treble damages, restitution and/or forfeitures. Under
government regulations, a company, or one or more of its operating divisions or subdivisions, can also be suspended or
debarred from government contracts, or lose its export privileges, based on the results of investigations. We believe,
based upon current information, that the outcome of any such legal proceeding, claim, or government dispute and
investigation will not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. Where it is
reasonably possible that we will incur losses in excess of recorded amounts in connection with any of the matters set
forth below, we will disclose either the amount or range of reasonably possible losses in excess of such amounts or,
where no such amount or range can be reasonably estimated, the reasons why no such estimate can be made.
Multiple legal actions have been filed against us as a result of the October 29, 2018 accident of Lion Air Flight 610 and
the March 10, 2019 accident of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302. Further, we are subject to ongoing governmental and
regulatory investigations and inquiries relating to the accidents and the 737 MAX, including investigations by the U.S.
Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission. We cannot reasonably estimate a range of loss,
if any, not covered by available insurance that may result given the ongoing status of these lawsuits, investigations, and
inquiries.
Note 23 – Segment and Revenue Information
Effective at the beginning of 2019, all revenues and costs associated with military derivative aircraft production are
reported in the BDS segment. Revenues and costs associated with military derivative aircraft production were
previously reported in the BCA and BDS segments. Business segment data for 2018 and 2017 reflects the realignment
for military derivative aircraft, as well as the realignment of certain programs from BDS to BGS.
Our primary profitability measurements to review a segment’s operating results are Earnings from operations and
operating margins. We operate in four reportable segments: BCA, BDS, BGS, and BCC. All other activities fall within
Unallocated items, eliminations and other. See page 56 for the Summary of Business Segment Data, which is an
integral part of this note.
111
Table of Contents
BCA develops, produces and markets commercial jet aircraft principally to the commercial airline industry worldwide.
Revenue on commercial aircraft contracts is recognized at the point in time when an aircraft is completed and accepted
by the customer.
BDS engages in the research, development, production and modification of the following products and related services:
manned and unmanned military aircraft and weapons systems, surveillance and engagement, strategic defense and
intelligence systems, satellite systems and space exploration. BDS revenue is generally recognized over the contract
term (over time) as costs are incurred.
BGS provides parts, maintenance, modifications, logistics support, training, data analytics and information-based
services to commercial and government customers worldwide. BGS segment revenue and costs include certain
services provided to other segments. Revenue on commercial spare parts contracts is recognized at the point in time
when a spare part is delivered to the customer. Revenue on other contracts is generally recognized over the contract
term (over time) as costs are incurred.
BCC facilitates, arranges, structures and provides selective financing solutions for our Boeing customers.
While our principal operations are in the United States, Canada and Australia, some key suppliers and subcontractors
are located in Europe and Japan. Revenues, including foreign military sales, are reported by customer location and
consist of the following:

in our BDS segment, for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Backlog
Our total backlog represents the estimated transaction prices on performance obligations to our customers for which
work remains to be performed. Backlog is converted into revenue in future periods as work is performed, primarily
based on the cost incurred or at delivery and acceptance of products, depending on the applicable accounting method.
Our backlog at December 31, 2019 was $463,403. We expect approximately 17% to be converted to revenue through
2020 and approximately 63% through 2023, with the remainder thereafter.

Table of Contents
Unallocated Items, Eliminations and other
Unallocated items, eliminations and other include common internal services that support Boeing’s global business
operations, intercompany guarantees provided to BCC and eliminations of certain sales between segments. Such sales
include airplanes accounted for as operating leases and considered transferred to the BCC segment. We generally
allocate costs to business segments based on the U.S. federal cost accounting standards. Components of Unallocated

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Expense
Pension costs, comprising GAAP service and prior service costs, are allocated to BCA and the commercial operations
at BGS. Pension costs are allocated to BDS and BGS businesses supporting government customers using U.S.
Government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS), which employ different actuarial assumptions and accounting
conventions than GAAP. These costs are allocable to government contracts. Other postretirement benefit costs are
allocated to business segments based on CAS, which is generally based on benefits paid. FAS/CAS service cost
adjustment represents the difference between the FAS pension and postretirement service costs calculated under
GAAP and costs allocated to the business segments. Non-operating pension and postretirement expenses represent
the components of net periodic benefit costs other than service cost. These expenses are included in Other income,
net.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of The Boeing Company
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial position of The Boeing Company and
subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the related consolidated statements of operations,
comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019,
and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and
the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019, in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated January 31, 2020,
expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the
PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities
laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material
misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to
those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial
statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to
accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging,
subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on
the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing
separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.

Cost Estimates for Fixed-Price Development Contracts - Refer to Notes 1 and 14 to the financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
As more fully described in Notes 1 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recognizes revenue
over time for long-term contracts as goods are produced or services are rendered. The Company uses costs incurred
as the method for determining progress, and revenue is recognized based on costs incurred to date plus an estimate of
margin at completion. The process of estimating margin at completion involves estimating the costs to complete
production of goods or rendering of services and comparing those costs to the estimated final revenue amount. Fixed-
price development contracts are inherently uncertain in that revenue is fixed while the estimates of costs required to
complete these contracts are subject to significant variability. Due to the technical performance requirements in many of
these contracts, changes to cost estimates could occur, resulting in lower margins or material reach-forward losses.
Given the complexity of certain of the Company’s fixed-price development contracts, including the KC-46A Tanker,
Commercial Crew, United States Air Force VC-25B Presidential Aircraft, MQ-25 Stingray, and T-7A Red Hawk
contracts, the limited amount of historical data available in certain instances and significant judgments necessary to
estimate future costs at completion, auditing these estimates involved extensive audit effort and a high degree of
auditor judgment and required audit professionals with industry and quantitative analytics experience.
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our auditing procedures related to the cost estimates for fixed-price development contracts included the following,
among others:
•We evaluated the appropriateness and consistency of management’s methods and assumptions in developing
its estimates.
•We performed inquiries of the Company’s project managers and others directly involved with the contracts and
observed the work site to evaluate project status and project challenges which may affect total estimated costs
to complete.
•We tested the accuracy and completeness of the data used in developing the estimates. We developed
independent expectations of likely outcomes using, in part, the program’s data and compared our expectations
to management’s estimates.
•We tested the effectiveness of controls including those over the data used in developing the estimates, the
mathematical extrapolation of such data, and management’s judgment regarding the range of possible
outcomes relating to the specific estimates.
•We performed retrospective reviews, comparing actual performance to estimated performance, when
evaluating the thoroughness and precision of management’s estimation process.
Program Accounting Estimates for New Programs - Refer to Notes 1 and 7 to the financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
The introduction of new aircraft programs involves increased risk associated with meeting development, certification
and production schedules. The Company uses program accounting in order to compute cost of sales and margin for
each commercial airplane sold. The use of program accounting requires estimating and demonstrating customer
demand for the number of units included in the program (program accounting quantity) and estimating the sales and
costs over the expected life of each program. In particular, estimating the initial program accounting quantity and
revenue for unsold units within the program accounting quantity involves measurement uncertainty resulting in a range
of possible outcomes. Changes to revenue or
119
Table of Contents
program accounting quantity estimates could occur, resulting in lower margins or material reach-forward losses.
Auditing the estimated market demand and revenue for unsold units for the 777X program involved extensive audit
effort and required professionals with industry and quantitative analytics experience given the high degree of
complexity and subjectivity related to management’s estimates.
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our auditing procedures related to estimated market demand and revenue for unsold units for the 777X included the
following, among others:
•We inquired of the Company’s management, including individuals responsible for sales and pricing, to evaluate
the status of current sales campaigns, short and long-term market demand, and overall program status.
•We evaluated the appropriateness and consistency of management’s methods and assumptions used in
developing its estimates related to the initial program accounting quantity and revenue for unsold units.
•We evaluated management’s ability to estimate program revenue by comparison to historical estimates and
actual results on similar programs.
•We developed independent expectations of likely outcomes using, in part, the program’s data and compared
our expectations to management’s estimates.
•We tested the effectiveness of controls including those over the data used in developing the estimates, the
mathematical extrapolation of such data, and management’s judgment regarding the range of possible
outcomes relating to the specific estimates.
Liabilities related to the 737 MAX Grounding - Refer to Notes 14 and 22 to the financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
On March 13, 2019, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued an order to suspend operations of all 737 MAX
aircraft in the U.S. and by U.S. aircraft operators following two fatal accidents of 737 MAX aircraft. Non-U.S. civil
aviation authorities have issued directives to the same effect (the “737 MAX Grounding”). In addition, multiple legal
actions have been filed against the Company following the fatal accidents and various governmental and regulatory
investigations and inquiries continue relating to the accidents and the 737 MAX aircraft.
During 2019, the Company recorded a liability in connection with estimated payments, concessions and other in-kind
consideration it intends to provide to customers for disruptions related to the 737 MAX Grounding and associated
delivery delays. This liability totaled $7.4 billion at December 31, 2019 and is reflected in the financial statements in
Accrued liabilities. This represents the Company’s best estimate of future concessions and other consideration to its
customers, and is necessarily based on individual negotiations with customers and a series of assumptions, including
the timing and conditions of the 737 MAX’s return to service in various jurisdictions and the timing of future production
rate increases. Because the timing and conditions of the 737 MAX return to service in various jurisdictions will be
determined by civil aviation authorities and is outside of the Company’s control, the assumptions underlying the liability
require a high degree of auditor judgment.
Significant judgment is involved in management’s ability to assess and reasonably estimate potential additional
financial statement effects or a range of loss, if any, resulting from the outcome of 737 MAX-related litigation and the
results of the various governmental and regulatory investigations and inquiries related to the 737 MAX.
120
Table of Contents
The subjectivity of the liability associated with providing consideration to customers resulting from the 737 MAX
Grounding and the complexity of assessing the outcome of the ongoing litigation and investigations related to the 737
MAX required a high degree of auditor judgment and increased audit effort.
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our auditing procedures associated with liabilities related to the 737 MAX grounding included the following, among
others:
•We inquired of management to understand developments with the 737 MAX Grounding, including the status of
regulatory approval for return to service in various jurisdictions and the status of consideration discussions with
individual customers.
•We obtained written representations from management concerning its intent to provide consideration to
customers and the extent of that consideration.
•We tested the effectiveness of controls related to nonrecurring items and loss contingencies associated with
litigation, claims and assessments.
•We evaluated the significant assumptions used by management to estimate the liability for customer
consideration, including the timing and conditions of 737 MAX return to service, and, where possible, we
corroborated the assumptions with management outside of the accounting and finance organizations.
•We reviewed the terms of customer contracts and correspondence with customers concerning potential
consideration as a result of the 737 MAX Grounding.
•We inquired of internal and external legal counsel to understand developments related to contractual
obligations to customers, litigation and other claims relating to the 737 MAX Grounding and progression in
potential settlement discussions.
•We read minutes of meetings of the Board of Directors and its committees for evidence of unrecorded loss
contingencies.
•We evaluated the Company’s disclosures for consistency with our knowledge of matters related to the 737
MAX Grounding.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of The Boeing Company
Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of The Boeing Company and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of
December 31, 2019 , based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013 ) issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects,
effective internal contro l over financial reportin g as of December 31, 2019 , based on criteria established in Internal Control -
Integrated Framework (2013)  issued by COSO.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)
(PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019  of the Company , and our report
dated January 31, 2020  expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’ s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment
of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’ s Report on Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting. Our respons ibility is to express an opinion on the Company’ s internal control over financial
reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with
respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities
and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit  in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material
weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a
reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’ s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. A company’ s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to
the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of
the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’ s assets that
could have a material ef fect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections
of any evaluation of ef fectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes
in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
