GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES
PART I
Item 1. Business
General Motors Company (sometimes referred to as we, our, us, ourselves, the Company, General Motors, or GM) was
incorporated as a Delaware corporation in 2009. We design, build and sell trucks, crossovers, cars and automobile parts and provide
software-enabled services and subscriptions worldwide. Our automotive operations meet the demands of our customers through our
automotive segments: GM North America (GMNA) and GM International (GMI) with vehicles developed, manufactured and/or
marketed under the Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet and GMC brands. We also have equity ownership stakes in entities that meet the
demands of customers in other countries, primarily in China, with vehicles developed, manufactured and/or marketed under the
Baojun, Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet and Wuling brands. Cruise is our global segment responsible for the development and
commercialization of autonomous vehicle technology. We provide automotive financing services through our General Motors
Financial Company, Inc. (GM Financial) segment. Refer to Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) and Note 23 to our consolidated financial statements for financial information about
our segments. Except for per share amounts or as otherwise specified, amounts presented within tables are stated in millions. Certain
columns and rows may not add due to rounding. Forward-looking statements in this Business section are not guarantees of future
performance and may involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. Refer
to Item 1A. Risk Factors and the "Forward-Looking Statements" section of Part II, Item 7. MD&A for a discussion of these risks and
uncertainties.
Our vision for the future is a world with zero crashes, zero emissions and zero congestion, which guides our growth-focused
strategy to invest in electric vehicles (EVs) and autonomous vehicles (AVs), software-enabled services and subscriptions and new
business opportunities, while strengthening our market position in profitable internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles, such as
trucks and sport utility vehicles (SUVs).
We have an opportunity to grow our vehicle and financing revenue by continuing to capitalize on the strength of our established
vehicle franchises and customer base and scaling our EV production through this decade. We also have the potential of growing our
revenue through our software-enabled services and subscriptions, including OnStar, our advanced driver-assistance systems
(ADAS), including Super Cruise, and future offerings, such as our next-generation ADAS, Ultra Cruise, and Ultifi, our end-to-end
software platform. Additionally, we are incubating several new businesses with a start-up mindset that we believe will enable us to
attract new customers and generate revenues in new areas.
Electric Vehicles We plan to rapidly scale our capacity to build one million EVs in North America and more than two million EVs
globally by the end of 2025. A key element in our EV strategy is Ultium, our dedicated electric vehicle propulsion architecture. This
platform is flexible and will be leveraged across multiple brands and vehicle sizes, styles and drive configurations, allowing for
quick response to customer preferences and a shorter design and development lead time compared to our ICE vehicles. Our first
Ultium-based products launched in 2021 with the GMC HUMMER EV and BrightDrop Zevo 600, followed by the Cadillac LYRIQ
in 2022. We plan to leverage the versatility and flexibility of Ultium to expand our EV portfolio over a wide variety of segments and
price points including the Chevrolet Equinox EV, the Chevrolet Blazer EV, the Chevrolet Silverado EV and the GMC Sierra EV,
which are expected to be launched over 2023 and 2024.
In 2021, we began production at GM’s Factory ZERO Detroit-Hamtramck Assembly Center (Factory ZERO), which was re-tooled
into a fully dedicated EV facility to produce the GMC HUMMER EV, the upcoming Cruise Origin, the Chevrolet Silverado EV and
the GMC Sierra EV. In January 2022, we announced that we will convert our assembly plant in Orion Township, Michigan for fully
dedicated EV production, including the Chevrolet Silverado EV and the GMC Sierra EV. Additionally, we have announced plans to
mass-produce battery cells for these and other future EVs through Ultium Cells Holdings LLC (an equally owned joint venture with
LG Energy Solution) in Warren, Ohio, Spring Hill, Tennessee and Lansing, Michigan. A fourth U.S.-based battery cell plant is also
planned.
To support mass market adoption of EVs, we are working to ensure that our customers will have access to comprehensive
charging solutions. For personal vehicles, this means strategically addressing charging needs at home, the workplace and in public
locations, for which we have committed to invest nearly $750 million through 2025. For example, in November 2021, we announced
a collaboration with EVgo to install 3,250 DC fast charging stalls in more than 50 U.S. metropolitan markets. In July 2022, we
announced a collaboration with EVgo and Pilot Company targeting the installation of a coast-to-coast network of 2,000 DC fast
charging stalls at 50-mile intervals across the U.S., enabling long-distance corridor charging. This network will be open to all EV
brands at up to 500 Pilot and Flying J travel centers. For fleet vehicles, we are developing turnkey charging solutions and fleet and
facility energy management services. In addition, we have announced collaborative work with several
1

GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES
charge network operators to filter real-time data on their respective networks and charge station health into a holistic charging
approach that integrates charging networks, GM vehicle mobile apps and other products and services to simplify the overall charging
experience for GM EV owners in North America.
BrightDrop BrightDrop is developing a suite of solutions, including the BrightDrop Zevo all-electric delivery vans, BrightDrop
Trace electrically propelled smart containers and the BrightDrop Core software platform, which is focused on helping companies
better visualize and optimize their fleet operations. We expect these solutions will help the world's largest delivery and logistics
companies do more with less, while helping to improve operating efficiencies, eliminate operating emissions and reduce congestion.
BrightDrop's Zevo 600 and Zevo 400 full-scale production facility, CAMI Assembly, launched in late 2022, with start of regular
production (SORP) targeted for the first quarter of 2023. BrightDrop delivered the first Zevo 600s to FedEx Express, our launch
customer, and generated reservations and expressions of interest for Zevo vans from several major companies, including DHL
Express Canada, Walmart and Merchants Fleet.
OnStar and Vehicle Connectivity We offer OnStar and connected services to more than 21 million connected vehicles globally
through subscription-based and complimentary services. We are among the leaders in the industry, with global real-world experience
in delivering connected services and advanced safety features. OnStar offers safety and security services for retail and fleet
customers, including automatic crash response, emergency services, roadside assistance, crisis assist, stolen vehicle assistance and
turn-by-turn navigation. Additionally, we offer OnStar Guardian in select markets, a mobile app that allows customers to access key
OnStar safety and security services from their compatible mobile device. Fleet customers in some markets can leverage OnStar
Vehicle Insights, our telematics solution across their entire fleet, regardless of vehicle make or model. We also offer a variety of
connected services in certain markets, including mobile apps for owners to remotely control certain vehicle features and EV owners
to locate charging stations, on-demand vehicle diagnostics, GM Smart Driver, Amazon Alexa in-vehicle voice, Google's Voice
Assistant, navigation and app ecosystem, connected navigation, SiriusXM with 360L, 4G LTE wireless connectivity and 5G
connectivity which will be available in select model year 2024 vehicles.
Super Cruise and Ultra Cruise We offer Super Cruise, the industry's first true hands-free driver assistance technology that enables
drivers of eligible vehicles to travel hands-free on more than 400,000 miles of compatible roads in the U.S. and Canada. We will
make Super Cruise available on 22 vehicles in North America and China by the end of 2023. Ultra Cruise is a significant next step in
advanced driver assistance technology, designed to ultimately enable a hands-free driving experience in 95 percent of all driving
scenarios, that will debut on the Cadillac CELESTIQ.
Ultifi Ultifi is our end-to-end software platform that will provide customers with software-defined features, apps and services
over-the-air starting in 2023. Ultifi and the apps it enables will empower customers to update their ownership experiences with
desirable features such as services and subscriptions, vehicle performance, Super Cruise and, when launched, Ultra Cruise, safety
and security features, climate and comfort options, personal themes and EV ownership experience elements.
Cruise General Motors and Cruise are pursuing what we believe is the most comprehensive path to autonomous mobility in the
industry. In September 2021, Cruise began operating a driverless ride hail service in San Francisco, California, and in June 2022,
began charging the public for driverless rides. Cruise continues to make regulatory progress in California. In December 2022, Cruise
received regulatory approval to expand its operational design domain in California. Cruise is also seeking regulatory approval to add
the Cruise Origin to its driverless test permit. Additionally, in September 2022, Cruise acquired regulatory permits to operate
driverless ride hail services in Phoenix, Arizona and began pursuing ride hail operations in Austin, Texas. Given the potential of all-
electric self-driving vehicles to help save lives, reshape our cities and reduce emissions, the goal of Cruise is to deliver its self-
driving services as soon as possible, but as Cruise continues to expand and scale its operations, safety will continue to be the gating
metric, supported by Cruise's Safety Management System and its other risk identification, assessment and mitigation processes.
We believe that building all-electric vehicles with autonomous capabilities integrated from the beginning, rather than through
retrofits, is the most efficient way to unlock the tremendous potential societal benefits of self-driving cars. The Cruise Origin, a
purpose-built, all-electric, self-driving vehicle that is being co-developed by GM, Cruise and Honda Motor Company, Ltd. (Honda)
will be built on GM’s all-new modular architecture, powered by the Ultium platform, at Factory ZERO starting in 2023 pending
government approvals. GM and Cruise are awaiting a decision on an exemption petition that was filed with the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) seeking regulatory approval for the Origin’s deployment.
HYDROTEC We are developing hydrogen fuel cell applications across transportation types and industries, including mobile power
generation, class 7/8 truck, locomotive and aerospace. The development of HYDROTEC technology is another element of our long-
term commitment toward a world with zero emissions. We believe hydrogen fuel cells will play an important role in many
automotive and other mobility applications where customers will derive additional benefits from the ability to refuel quickly, an
extended range, suitability for heavier payloads and central refueling of large fleets. GM and Honda, through our
2

GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES
long-term strategic alliance to collaborate in research and advanced engineering efforts, are developing and commercializing fuel
cell systems. In 2021, we announced a number of commercial relationships and, in November 2022, we announced a joint
development agreement with Nel Hydrogen US to help enable cost competitive renewable hydrogen production.
OnStar Insurance Services OnStar Insurance is currently available in all 50 states. This innovative startup leverages GM's
expertise in data and vehicle technology to learn, scale and move the company forward. As technology evolves, OnStar Insurance
expects to transform traditional models to make the insurance process easier, smarter and more personalized for customers.
GM Defense GM Defense is developing products and solutions for global government and military customers by leveraging GM's
commercial investments in vehicle, electrification, autonomy and connected vehicle technologies. GM Defense's growth strategy is
focused on building a portfolio of products, including the Infantry Squad Vehicle and the armored Heavy Duty SUV.
Competitive Position and Vehicle Sales The principal factors that determine consumer vehicle preferences in the markets in which
we operate include overall vehicle design, price, quality, available options, safety, reliability, fuel economy and functionality. Market
leadership in individual countries in which we compete varies widely.
We present both wholesale and total vehicle sales data to assist in the analysis of our revenue and our market share. Wholesale
vehicle sales data consists of sales to GM's dealers and distributors, as well as sales to the U.S. Government, and excludes vehicles
sold by our joint ventures. Wholesale vehicle sales data correlates to our revenue recognized from the sale of vehicles, which is the
largest component of Automotive net sales and revenue. In the year ended December 31, 2022, 30.5% of our wholesale vehicle sales
volume was generated outside the U.S. The following table summarizes wholesale vehicle sales by automotive segment (vehicles in
thousands):
Years Ended December 31,
2022 2021 2020
GMNA 2,926 81.8 % 2,308 80.7 % 2,707 80.3 %
GMI 653 18.2 % 551 19.3 % 663 19.7 %
Total 3,579 100.0 % 2,859 100.0 % 3,370 100.0 %
Total vehicle sales data represents: (1) retail sales (i.e., sales to consumers who purchase new vehicles from dealers or
distributors); (2) fleet sales (i.e., sales to large and small businesses, governments and daily rental car companies); and (3) vehicles
used by dealers in their businesses. Total vehicle sales data for periods presented prior to 2022 reflect courtesy transportation
vehicles used by U.S. dealers in their business. Beginning in 2022, we stopped including such dealership courtesy transportation
vehicles in total vehicle sales until such time as those vehicles were sold to the end customer. Total vehicle sales data includes all
sales by joint ventures on a total vehicle basis, not based on our percentage ownership interest in the joint venture. Certain joint
venture agreements in China allow for the contractual right to report vehicle sales of non-GM trademarked vehicles by those joint
ventures, which are included in the total vehicle sales we report for China. While total vehicle sales data does not correlate directly
to the revenue we recognize during a particular period, we believe it is indicative of the underlying demand for our vehicles. Total
vehicle sales data represents management's good faith estimate based on sales reported by GM's dealers, distributors, and joint
ventures, commercially available data sources such as registration and insurance data, and internal estimates and forecasts when
other data is not available.

As discussed above, total vehicle sales and market share data provided in the table above includes fleet vehicles. We sell vehicles
directly or through our dealer network to fleet customers, including daily rental car companies, commercial fleet customers, leasing
companies and governments. Certain fleet transactions, particularly sales to daily rental car companies, are generally less profitable
than retail sales to end customers. The following table summarizes estimated fleet sales and those sales as a percentage of total
vehicle sales (vehicles in thousands):
Years Ended December 31,

GMNA 564 399 493 
GMI 426 311 351 
Total fleet sales 990 710 844 
Fleet sales as a percentage of total vehicle sales 16.7 % 11.3 % 12.4 %
Product Pricing Several methods are used to promote our products, including the use of dealer, retail and fleet incentives, such as
customer rebates and finance rate support. The level of incentives is dependent upon the level of competition in the markets in which
we operate and the level of demand for our products.
Cyclical and Seasonal Nature of Business The market for vehicles is cyclical and depends in part on general economic
conditions, credit availability and consumer spending. Vehicle markets are also seasonal. Production varies from month to month.
Vehicle model changeovers occur throughout the year as a result of new market entries.
Relationship with Dealers We market vehicles and automotive parts worldwide primarily through a network of independent
authorized retail dealers. These outlets include distributors, dealers and authorized sales, service and parts outlets. Our customers can
obtain a wide range of after-sale vehicle services and products through our dealer network, such as maintenance, light repairs,
collision repairs, vehicle accessories and extended service warranties. The number of authorized dealerships and other agents
performing similar functions were 4,639 in GMNA and 7,318 in GMI at December 31, 2022.
We, and our joint ventures, enter into a contract with each authorized dealer agreeing to sell to the dealer one or more specified
product lines at wholesale prices and granting the dealer the right to sell those products to customers from an approved location. Our
dealers often offer more than one GM brand at a single dealership in a number of our markets. Authorized dealers offer parts,
accessories, service and repairs for GM vehicles in the product lines that they sell using GM parts and accessories. Our dealers are
authorized to service GM vehicles under our limited warranty, and those repairs are made almost exclusively with GM parts. Our
dealers generally provide their customers with access to credit or lease financing, vehicle insurance and extended service contracts,
which may be provided by GM Financial and other financial institutions.
The quality of GM dealerships and our relationship with our dealers are critical to our success, now, and as we transition to our
all-electric future, given that they maintain the primary sales and service interface with the end consumer of our products. In addition
to the terms of our contracts with our dealers, we are regulated by various country and state franchise laws and regulations that may
supersede those contractual terms and impose specific regulatory requirements and standards for initiating dealer network changes,
pursuing terminations for cause and other contractual matters.
Research, Product Development and Intellectual Property Costs for research, manufacturing engineering, product engineering
and design and development activities primarily relate to developing new products or services or improving existing products or
services, including activities related to vehicle and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions control, improved fuel economy, EVs, AVs and
the safety of drivers and passengers. Research and development expenses were $9.8 billion, $7.9 billion and $6.2 billion in the years
ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.
Product Development The Global Product Development organization is responsible for designing, developing and integrating all
global products and their components while aiming to maximize part sharing across multiple vehicle segments. Our global vehicle
architecture development is headquartered at our Global Technical Center in Warren, Michigan, where our global teams in Design,
Program Management & Execution, Component & Subsystem Engineering, Product Safety, Systems & Integration, Software
Defined Vehicle & Embedded Platforms, Electrification & Battery Systems, Technology Acceleration & Commercialization and
Purchasing & Supply Chain collaborate to meet customer requirements and maximize global economies of scale.

GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES
We continue to invest in key ICE segments, which are critical to fund our all-electric future. Cross-segment part sharing is an
essential enabler to optimize our vehicle portfolio profitability, with more than 75% of our global internal combustion vehicle sales
volume expected to come from five internal combustion vehicle architectures through this decade. We will continue to leverage our
ICE portfolio to accommodate our customers around the world while achieving our financial goals.
In 2021, we announced our investment in the Wallace Battery Cell Innovation Center, an all-new facility that has significantly
expanded the Company's battery technology operations and will continue to accelerate the development and commercialization of
longer range, more affordable EV batteries. The Wallace Center is located on the campus of the Global Technical Center in Warren,
Michigan.
Intellectual Property We are constantly innovating and hold a significant number of patents, copyrights, trade secrets and other
intellectual property that protect those innovations in numerous countries. While no single piece of intellectual property is
individually material to our business as a whole, our intellectual property is important to our operations and continued technological
development. Additionally, we hold a number of trademarks and service marks that are very important to our identity and
recognition in the marketplace.
Raw Materials, Services and Supplies We purchase a wide variety of raw materials, systems, components, parts, supplies, energy,
freight, transportation and other services from numerous suppliers to manufacture our products. The raw materials primarily include
steel, aluminum, resins, copper, lead, precious metals and raw materials used in EVs. We do not normally carry substantial
inventories of these raw materials in excess of levels reasonably required to meet our production requirements, and while we have
not experienced any significant shortages of raw materials, we have recently experienced supply disruptions resulting in temporary
production stoppages. In addition, our transition to EVs will require developing a more resilient, scalable and sustainable North
America-focused EV supply chain, which includes advancing our strategic sourcing initiatives to secure supply through investments
in raw materials suppliers and the execution of strategic, multi-year supply agreements with suppliers throughout the value chain.
This includes securing supply through offtake agreements for EV raw materials, such as lithium, cathode active material, synthetic
and natural graphite, nickel, cobalt, rare earth elements and permanent motor magnets. These EV-related agreements may require us
to hold higher than normal levels of EV raw materials inventory. Expected demand for these raw materials currently exceeds the
capacity of the existing supply chain and our raw material sourcing strategy aims to secure raw material supply to support our EV
transition.
Commodity costs are expected to remain elevated due to the macro-economic environment and the continuing existence of tariffs.
In addition, global supply chain disruptions have had, and are continuing to have, wide-ranging effects across multiple industries,
particularly the automotive industry. Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors and to Part II, Item 7. MD&A for further discussion on the
effect global supply chain disruptions have had on our results of operations. Furthermore, an increased demand for rare earth
minerals is increasing scrutiny of the sustainability and human rights implications of rare earth mineral supply chains.
In some instances, we purchase systems, components, parts and supplies from a single source, which may increase risk to supply
disruptions. The inability or unwillingness of these sources to provide us with parts and supplies could have a material adverse effect
on our production. Combined purchases from our two largest suppliers were approximately 11% of our total purchases in the year
ended December 31, 2022, approximately 12% of our total purchases in the year ended December 31, 2021, and approximately 11%
of our total purchases in the year ended December 31, 2020. Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion of these risks.
Automotive Financing - GM Financial GM Financial is our global captive automotive finance company and our global provider of
automobile finance solutions. GM Financial conducts its business in North America, South America and through joint ventures in
China.
GM Financial provides retail loan and lease lending across the credit spectrum to support vehicle sales. Additionally, GM
Financial offers commercial lending products to dealers including floorplan financing, which is lending to finance new and used
vehicle inventory; and dealer loans, which are loans to finance improvements to dealership facilities, to provide working capital, or
to purchase and/or finance dealership real estate. Other commercial lending products include financing for parts and accessories,
dealer fleets and storage centers.
In North America, GM Financial offers a sub-prime lending program. The program is primarily offered to consumers with a FICO
score or its equivalent of less than 620 who have limited access to automobile financing through banks and credit unions and is
expected to sustain a higher level of credit losses than prime lending.

Human Capital
The foundation of GM’s business is our Purpose: We pioneer the innovations that move and connect people to what matters. It is
why we exist. Our Purpose, growth strategy and culture all help us on our path towards achieving our vision of — a world with zero
crashes, zero emissions and zero congestion. Our people are our most valuable asset, and we must continue to attract and retain the
best talent in the world in order to achieve this vision. As a result, we strive to create a Workplace of Choice to attract, retain and
develop top talent by adhering to a responsible employer philosophy, which includes, among other things, commitments to create job
opportunities, pay workers fairly, ensure safety and well-being, and promote diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI). Fundamental to
these commitments are our company values.

GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES
Our eight GM behaviors are the foundation of our culture; and how we behave encompasses key measures of our performance,
including the ways we conduct ourselves as we work with one another.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion At GM, we are committed to fostering a culture of diversity, equity and inclusion. In every
moment, we must decide what we can do — individually and collectively — to drive meaningful, deliberate and long-lasting
change. GM’s unwavering commitment in this regard includes taking steps to ensure that all areas of our business are supportive of a
world-class inclusive, equitable and diverse organization. Our ability to meet the needs of a diverse and global customer base is tied
closely to the behaviors of the people within our company, which is why we are committed to fostering a culture that celebrates our
differences. This commitment is embraced at all levels of the organization, including our diverse Board of Directors, which is
currently made up of almost 50% women (6 out of 13 members) and is more than 30% racially or ethnically diverse (4 out of 13
members).
Based on these longstanding values, our Chair and CEO, Mary Barra, chairs an Inclusion Advisory Board (IAB) of internal and
external leaders who guide our work to improve diversity and inclusion in our Company. The purpose of the IAB is to consult with
GM’s Senior Leadership Team with the long-term goal of inspiring the Company to be inclusive through our words, deeds and
culture. We also have a number of programs and partnerships aimed at enhancing our culture of inclusion throughout the Company.
For example, we have 12 voluntary, employee-led resource groups that provide a forum for diverse employees and allies from a
variety of different backgrounds to share experiences and contribute to our collective cultural intelligence and growth. Each group
also works to attract and retain new talent and offers employees opportunities to support our company’s diversity initiatives within
the community.
GM has added resources skilled in new areas like inclusive leadership coaching, workforce design, accessibility and community
partnerships. These investments are designed to help increase DEI overall maturity, increasing pathways for talent entry and
development in the company and fostering partnerships that improve equity inside and outside of GM. As an example, in January
2021, GM welcomed the industry’s first chief engineer of accessibility to lead a new Accessibility Center of Excellence, driving
GM’s approach toward increasing inclusivity in products and services. The team works across four main areas: researching and
innovating with the customer, defining what it means to have accessible solutions in our vehicles, working to create customizable
solutions for a variety of customer needs and creating an ecosystem to grow the culture around accessibility.
Develop and Retain Talented People Today, we compete for talent against other automotive companies and against businesses in
other sectors, such as technology. To win and keep top talent, we must provide a workplace culture that encourages employee
behaviors aligned with our values, fulfills employees' long-term individual aspirations and provides experiences that make
individuals feel valued, included and engaged. In furtherance of this goal, we invest significant resources to retain and develop our
talent. In addition to mentoring and networking opportunities, we offer a vast array of career development resources to help develop,
grow and enable employees to make the most of their careers at GM. Formal resources

include, among other things, the Technical Education Program, which offers our employees an opportunity to complete corporate
strategically aligned degrees and certificate programs at leading universities, and our Degreed Learning Platform, which brings forth
a variety of external and in-house content in learning pathways and other micro learnings. It is also tied to our GM competency and
skills model. Employees in some of our technical roles also have the opportunity to participate in the GM Technical Learning
University — a training and upskilling program designed to expand and update the technical prowess of our workforce.
GM recognizes that leadership effectiveness is a critical business need. All new managers in the Company are automatically
entered into a six-month immersive learning program and all new executives come together for an upskilling and targeted
development program designed around the GM leadership profile.
Safety and Well-Being The safety and well-being of our employees is also a critical component of our ability to transform the
future of personal mobility. At GM, we pride ourselves on our commitment to live values that return people home safely — Every
Person, Every Site, Every Day. Our unwavering commitment to safety is manifested through empowering employees to “Speak Up
for Safety” and the Employee Safety Concern Process. These resources make it easier for salaried, hourly or represented and
contract employees to report potential vehicle or workplace safety issues, or to suggest safety related improvements without fear of
retaliation. The well-being of our employees is equally as important to entice and stimulate creativity and innovation. In addition to
traditional healthcare, paid time off, paid parental leave, wellness programs, flextime scheduling and telecommuting arrangements
and retirement benefits, including a 401(k) company contribution and matching program, GM offers a variety of benefits and
resources to support employees' physical and mental health, including access to fitness facilities in certain locations, which help us
both attract talent and reap the benefits of a healthier workforce. Beginning January 1, 2023, where permissible, United States
salaried employees are able to add their domestic partners and their children to various benefits plans and policies under the specific
terms of such plans and policies.
Employees At December 31, 2022, we employed approximately 86,000 (52%) hourly employees and approximately 81,000 (48%)
salaried employees. At December 31, 2022, approximately 46,000 (44%) of our U.S. employees were represented by unions, a
majority of which were represented by the International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers
of America (UAW). The following table summarizes worldwide employment (in thousands):

Environmental and Regulatory Matters
Automotive Criteria Emissions Control Our products are subject to laws and regulations globally that require us to control certain
non-GHG automotive emissions, including vehicle and engine exhaust emission standards, vehicle evaporative emission standards
and onboard diagnostic (OBD) system requirements. Emission requirements have become more stringent as a result of stricter
standards and new diagnostic requirements that have come into force in many markets around the world, often with very little
harmonization. Regulatory authorities may conduct ongoing evaluations of products from all manufacturers. For additional
information, refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors.
The U.S. federal government, through the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), imposes stringent exhaust and evaporative
emission control requirements on vehicles sold in the U.S. The California Air Resources Board (CARB) likewise imposes stringent
exhaust and evaporative emission standards. The Clean Air Act permits states that have areas with air quality compliance issues to
adopt California emission standards in lieu of federal requirements. Seventeen states have adopted California emission standards,
and there is a possibility that additional U.S. jurisdictions could adopt California emission requirements in the future.
For each model year we must obtain certification that our vehicles and heavy-duty engines will meet emission requirements of the
EPA before we can sell vehicles in the U.S. and Canada, and of CARB before we can sell vehicles in California and the states that
have adopted California emission requirements.
The Canadian federal government's current vehicle pollutant emission requirements are generally aligned with U.S. federal
requirements.

In 2019, certain areas within China began implementation of the China 6 emission standard (China 6) requirements. China 6
combines elements of both European Union (EU) and U.S. standards and increases the time and mileage periods over which
manufacturers are responsible for a vehicle's emission performance. Nationwide implementation of China 6a for new registrations
occurred in January 2021, and the more stringent China 6b is expected to be implemented in July 2023. Finally in 2022, China began
studies regarding the next generation of vehicle emission standards (China 7), which will likely be influenced by the European (Euro
7) standards.
Brazil has approved a set of national emission standards referred to as L7, implemented in 2022, and L8, to be implemented from
2025 onward. L7 standards cover tailpipe exhaust gases, durability for emissions, evaporative emissions and noise limits, and
include additional OBD requirements and a phase-in for onboard refueling vapor recovery systems. L8 standards include targets for
vehicle emissions and reduce corporate exhaust limits every two years until 2031. Some of the requirements are aligned with those
of the EPA.
As a result of the sale of the Opel and Vauxhall businesses and certain other assets in Europe (the Opel/Vauxhall Business), GM’s
vehicle presence in Europe is smaller, but GM may still be affected by actions taken by regulators related both to Opel/Vauxhall
vehicles sold before the sale of the Opel/Vauxhall Business as well as to other vehicles GM continues to sell in Europe. In the EU,
increased scrutiny of compliance with emission standards may result in changes to these standards, as well as stricter interpretations
or redefinition of these standards and more rigorous enforcement. Beyond this, as a part of the EU’s desire to accelerate the shift to
sustainable mobility, the EU is looking to develop stricter emission standards (Euro 7) for all petrol and diesel cars, vans, lorries and
buses, as it is moving to end the sale of ICE vehicles past 2035, and place requirements on batteries to be used in EVs. For additional
information, refer to Note 16 to our consolidated financial statements.
Automotive Fuel Economy and GHG Emissions In the U.S., NHTSA promulgates and enforces Corporate Average Fuel
Economy (CAFE) standards for three separate fleets: domestic cars, import cars and light-duty trucks. Manufacturers may use one or
a combination of the following to resolve fleet deficits: credits from the five prior model years, expected credits for the next three
model years, credits obtained from other manufacturers, and payment of civil penalties. Manufacturers that do not resolve deficits
for a model year may be subject to substantial civil penalties. In addition to federal CAFE standards, the EPA promulgates and
enforces GHG emission standards. NHTSA and the EPA have separately finalized standards with differing stringency levels and
affected model years, with the CAFE standards addressing the 2024–2026 model years and the GHG standards addressing the 2023–
2026 model years. Both the CAFE and GHG standards have been challenged through litigation. NHTSA and the EPA also regulate
the fuel efficiency and GHG emissions of medium- and heavy-duty vehicles, imposing more stringent standards over time.
In addition, CARB has asserted the right to promulgate and enforce its own state GHG standards for motor vehicles, and other
states have asserted the right to adopt CARB's standards. CARB regulations previously stated that compliance with the light-duty
EPA GHG program is deemed compliance with CARB standards. However, in December 2018 CARB amended this regulation to
state that, in the event the EPA were to alter federal GHG stringency, which it now has, compliance with the EPA's GHG emission
standards will no longer be deemed compliance with CARB's separate requirements. While NHTSA and the EPA previously took
actions to preempt California’s GHG standards, NHTSA repealed its assertion of preemption and the EPA rescinded its withdrawal
of California’s preemption waiver, enabling CARB to enforce GHG standards from the Advanced Clean Cars (ACC) program for the
2021–2025 model years. As a result, GM is required to meet state GHG standards in California and 17 states that have adopted
California’s GHG standards. The EPA’s rescission of its withdrawal of California’s waiver has been challenged through litigation.
CARB has also imposed a requirement that increases percentages of Zero Emission Vehicles (ZEVs) that must be sold in
California. While NHTSA and the EPA previously took actions to preempt California’s ZEV standards, NHTSA repealed its
assertion of preemption and the EPA rescinded its withdrawal of California’s waiver, enabling CARB and 15 adopting states to
enforce ZEV standards from the ACC program. The EPA’s rescission of its withdrawal of California’s waiver has been challenged
through litigation. Further, in August 2022, CARB finalized its Advanced Clean Cars II (ACC II) program, including ZEV standards
requiring increasing percentages of ZEVs for the 2026–2035 model years, ending with a 100% sales target in the 2035 model year.
CARB must obtain a waiver from EPA to implement its ACC II program. Additional U.S. jurisdictions could adopt CARB’s ACC
and ACC II requirements in the future.
In Canada, federal light- and heavy-duty GHG regulations are currently patterned after the EPA GHG emission standards given the
integrated nature of the auto sector between Canada and the United States. The Canadian light-duty GHG standards continue to
largely align with the U.S. GHG standards for the 2023–2025 model years. Additionally, the Canadian federal government issued an
Emissions Reduction Plan requiring the implementation of increasingly stringent ZEV sales requirements for the 2026–2035 model
years, ending with a 100% sales target in the 2035 model year. The Canadian province of Quebec has ZEV requirements regulating
the 2018–2025 model years, largely based on California program requirements, and the province
11
Table of Contents
GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES
of British Columbia has similar ZEV regulations that were completed in July 2020 and cover the 2020–2039 model years. Both
provinces have proposed amendments to their ZEV regulations for the 2026–2035 model years ending with a 100% ZEV sales target
in the 2035 model year. A first draft of Canada’s national ZEV sales regulations was issued in December 2022.
China has two fuel economy requirements for passenger vehicles: an individual vehicle pass-fail type approval requirement and a
fleet average fuel consumption requirement. With a focus on the fleet average fuel consumption requirement, the China Phase 5
launched in 2021 and full compliance is required by 2025. In addition, China has established a mandate that requires passenger car
manufacturers to produce a certain volume of plug-in hybrid, battery electric and fuel cell vehicles, which are referred to as New
Energy Vehicles (NEVs), to generate credits in 2019 and beyond. The number of credits per car is based on the level of electric
range and energy efficiency, with the goal of increasing NEV volume penetrations and improving technological sophistication over
time. Uncommitted NEV credits may be used to assist compliance with the fleet average fuel consumption requirement. China has
issued NEV credit targets between 2019 and 2023 and is setting new NEV credit targets aimed at further increasing volumes of
NEVs in 2024 and 2025. China has provided various levels of subsidies for NEVs, and certain subsidies were extended to the end of
2022. Also in 2022, China began to study the fleet average fuel consumption requirement and NEV credit mandate for 2026–2030
(Phase 6). These standards can potentially be more stringent, aligned with the trend we are seeing in other key global markets.
In Brazil, the Secretary of Industry and Development promulgates and enforces CAFE standards and has enforced a new CAFE
program for the period October 2020–September 2026 for light-duty and mid-size trucks and SUVs, including diesel vehicles. The
second and third phases of the program are yet to be finalized and are expected to gradually become more stringent for each period.
We have several options to comply with existing and potential new regulations that we have utilized and may continue to utilize,
including increasing production and sale of certain vehicles, such as EVs, and curtailing production of others, which could include
profitable ICE vehicles; technology changes, including fuel consumption efficiency and engine upgrades; payment of penalties;
and/or the purchase of credits from third parties. We regularly evaluate our current and future product plans and strategies for
compliance with fuel economy and GHG regulations.
We plan to be carbon neutral by 2040 in our global products and operations, supported by a commitment to science-based targets.
In addition, the Company envisions an all-electric future and plans to eliminate tailpipe emissions from new U.S. light-duty vehicles
by 2035. These targets align with our growth and transformation plan including our commitment to an all-electric future, which will
be enabled by our Ultium platform and HYDROTEC technology as previously detailed. We also announced that we anticipate our
total annual capital spending and our investments in our battery cell manufacturing joint ventures to be in the range of $11.0 to $13.0
billion through 2025 primarily to accelerate this transformation plan.
Industrial Environmental Control Our operations are subject to a wide range of environmental protection laws including those
regulating air emissions, water discharge, waste management and environmental cleanup. Certain environmental statutes require that
responsible parties fund remediation actions regardless of fault, legality of original disposal or ownership of a disposal site. Under
certain circumstances these laws impose joint and several liability as well as liability for related damages to natural resources.
To further mitigate the impacts of our worldwide operations on the environment, including climate change, we are supplementing
our compliance programs with sustainability efforts focused on reducing operational GHG emissions, water consumption and
discharge and operational waste.
We aim to continue our progress toward becoming a Zero Waste company by diverting greater than 90% of our total operational
waste from landfills, incinerators, and energy recovery facilities by 2025. We also continue our efforts to increase our use of
renewable energy, improve our energy efficiency and work to drive growth and scale of renewables. We recently announced the
finalization of energy sourcing agreements required to secure 100% of the energy needed to power all our U.S. facilities with
renewable energy by 2025. This is in line with the accelerated target announced in September 2021 and 25 years ahead of the initial
target of 2050, set in 2016. We are on target to meet the remaining needs of our global operations with 100% renewable energy by
2035.
Chemical Regulations We continually monitor the implementation of chemical regulations to maintain compliance and evaluate
their effect on our business, suppliers and the automotive industry.
Globally, governments continue to introduce new legislation and regulations related to the selection and use of chemicals by
mandating broad prohibitions or restrictions and implementing vehicle interior air quality, green chemistry, life cycle analysis
12

GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES
and product stewardship initiatives. These initiatives give broad regulatory authority to ban or restrict the use of certain chemical
substances and potentially affect automobile manufacturers' responsibilities for vehicle components at the end of a vehicle's life, as
well as chemical selection for product development and manufacturing. Global treaties and initiatives such as the Stockholm, Basel
and Rotterdam Conventions on Chemicals and Waste, the Minamata Convention on Mercury and EU Registration, Evaluation,
Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH), are driving chemical regulations across signatory countries. Increases in the
use of circuit boards and other electronics may require additional assessment under the Restriction on Hazardous Substances and
Waste from Electrical and Electronic Equipment directives. New European requirements require suppliers of parts and vehicles to
the European market to disclose substances of concern in parts.
Chemical regulations are increasing in North America. In the U.S., the EPA is moving forward with risk analysis and management
of high priority chemicals under the authority of the 2016 Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act. In addition, several
U.S. states have chemical management regulations that can affect vehicle design and manufacturing such as chemical restriction and
use requirements. For example, Maine will likely require the reporting of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in 2023, and
the elimination of PFAS in 2030, except for unavoidable uses. Chemical restrictions and export controls in Canada continue to
steadily progress under the Environment and Climate Change Canada's Chemical Management Plan to assess existing substances
and implement risk management controls on any chemical deemed toxic.
These emerging laws and regulations will potentially lead to increases in costs and supply chain complexity. Manufacturers,
including joint venture partners and suppliers, that do not comply with global and specific country regulations could be subject to
civil penalties, production disruptions, or limitations on the sale of affected products. We believe we are materially in compliance
with substantially all these requirements or expect to be materially in compliance by the required dates.
Vehicle Safety
U.S. Requirements The National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966 (the Safety Act) regulates the vehicles and items of
motor vehicle equipment that we manufacture and sell. The Safety Act prohibits the sale in the United States of any new vehicle or
equipment that does not conform to applicable federal motor vehicle safety standards established by NHTSA. Meeting or exceeding
the many safety standards is costly as global compliance and non-governmental assessment requirements continue to evolve and
grow more complex, and lack harmonization globally. The Safety Act further requires that if we or NHTSA determine a vehicle or
an item of vehicle equipment does not comply with a safety standard, or that vehicle or equipment contains a defect that poses an
unreasonable safety risk, we must conduct a safety recall to remedy that condition in the affected vehicles. Should we or NHTSA
determine a safety defect or noncompliance issue exists with respect to any of our vehicles, the cost of such recall campaigns could
be substantial.
Other National Requirements Outside of the U.S., many countries have established vehicle safety standards and regulations and
are likely to adopt additional, more stringent requirements in the future. The European General Safety Regulation has introduced
United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UN-ECE) regulations, which are required for the European Type Approval
process. Globally, governments generally have been adopting UN-ECE based regulations with some variations to address local
concerns. Any difference between North American and UN-ECE based regulations can add complexity and costs to vehicle
development, and we continue to support efforts to harmonize regulations to reduce complexity. New safety and recall requirements
in various countries around the world, including in China, Brazil, and Gulf Cooperation Council countries, also may add substantial
costs and complexity to our safety and field action activities globally. In Canada, vehicle regulatory requirements are currently
aligned with U.S. regulations; however, under the Canadian Motor Vehicle Safety Act, recall thresholds are different and the
Minister of Transport has broad powers to order manufacturers to submit a notice of defect or non-compliance when the Minister
considers it to be in the interest of safety. Further, various governments are beginning to mandate e-Call and other features that can
be market-specific and add complexity and increase our cost of compliance globally.
Crash Test Ratings and New Car Assessment Programs Organizations in various regions around the world, including in the U.S.,
rate and compare motor vehicles through various New Car Assessment Programs (NCAPs) to provide consumers and businesses
with additional information about the safety of new vehicles. NCAPs use crash tests and other evaluations that are different than
what is required by applicable regulations, and use stars or other grading systems, depending on the region, to rate vehicle safety.
Achieving high NCAP ratings, which can vary by country and region, can add complexity and cost to vehicles.

Item 1A. Risk Factors
We have listed below the most material risk factors applicable to us. These risk factors are not necessarily in the order of
importance or probability of occurrence:
Risks related to our competition and strategy
If we do not deliver new products, services, technologies and customer experiences in response to increased competition and
changing consumer preferences in the automotive industry, our business could suffer. We believe that the automotive industry
will continue to experience significant change in the coming years, particularly as traditional automotive original equipment
manufacturers continue to shift resources to the development of EVs. In addition to our traditional competitors, we must also be
responsive to the entrance of start-ups and other non-traditional competitors in the automotive industry, such as ridesharing services.
These new competitors, as well as established industry participants, are disrupting the historic business model of our industry
through the introduction of new technologies, products, services, direct-to-consumer sales channels, methods of transportation and
vehicle ownership. To successfully execute our long-term strategy, we must continue to develop new products and services,
including products and services that are outside of our historically core ICE business, such as EVs and AVs, software-enabled
connected services and other new businesses.
Our vehicles and connected services increasingly rely on software and hardware that is highly technical and complex. The process
of designing and developing new technology, products and services is costly and uncertain and requires extensive capital investment
and the ability to retain and recruit the best talent. If our access to capital were to become significantly constrained, if costs of capital
increased significantly, or if our ability to raise capital is challenged relative to our peers, in each case including as a result of any
constraints on lending due to concerns about climate change, our ability to execute on our strategic plans could be adversely
affected. Further, the market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive. Failure to attract, hire,
develop, motivate and retain highly qualified and diverse employees could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our strategic
plans.
There can be no assurance that advances in technology will occur in a timely or feasible way, if at all, that others will not acquire
similar or superior technologies sooner than we do, or that we will acquire technologies on an exclusive basis or at a significant price
advantage. Further, if we are unable to prevent or effectively remedy errors, bugs, vulnerabilities or defects in our software and
hardware, or fail to deploy updates to our software properly, or if we do not adequately prepare for and respond to new kinds of
technological innovations, market developments and changing customer needs, our sales, profitability and long-term
competitiveness may be harmed.
Our ability to maintain profitability is dependent upon our ability to timely fund and introduce new and improved vehicle
models, including EVs, that are able to attract a sufficient number of consumers. We operate in a very competitive industry with
market participants routinely introducing new and improved vehicle models and features designed to meet rapidly evolving
consumer expectations. Producing new and improved vehicle models, including EVs, that preserve our reputation for designing,
building and selling safe, high-quality cars, crossovers, trucks and SUVs is critical to our long-term profitability. Successful
launches of our new vehicles are critical to our short-term profitability. The new vehicle development process can take two years or
more, and a number of factors may lengthen that time period. Because of this product development cycle and the various elements
that may contribute to consumers’ acceptance of new vehicle designs, including competitors’ product introductions, technological
innovations, fuel prices, general economic conditions, regulatory developments, transportation infrastructure and changes in quality,
safety, reliability and styling demands and preferences, an initial product concept or design may not result in a saleable vehicle or a
vehicle that generates sales in sufficient quantities and at high enough prices to be profitable. Our high proportion of fixed costs,
both due to our significant investment in property, plant and equipment as
14
Table of Contents
GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES
well as other requirements of our collective bargaining agreements, which limit our flexibility to adjust personnel costs to changes in
demands for our products, may further exacerbate the risks associated with incorrectly assessing demand for our vehicles.
Our long-term strategy is dependent upon our ability to profitably deliver a broad portfolio of EVs. The production and
profitable sale of EVs has become increasingly important to our long-term business as we accelerate our transition to an all-electric
future. Our EV strategy is dependent on our ability to deliver a broad portfolio of high-quality EVs that are competitive and meet
consumer demands; scale our EV manufacturing capabilities; reduce the costs associated with the manufacture of EVs, particularly
with respect to battery cells and packs; increase vehicle range and the energy density of our batteries; efficiently source sufficient
materials for the manufacture of EV battery cells; license and monetize our proprietary platforms and related innovations;
successfully invest in new technologies relative to our peers; develop new software and services; and leverage our scale,
manufacturing capabilities and synergies with existing ICE vehicles.
In addition, consumer adoption of EVs will be critical to the success of our strategy. Consumer adoption of EVs could be impacted
by numerous factors, including the breadth of the portfolio of EVs available; perceptions about EV features, quality, safety,
performance and cost relative to ICE vehicles; the range over which EVs may be driven on a given battery charge; the proliferation
of charging infrastructure, in particular with respect to public EV charging stations, and the success of the Company's charging
infrastructure programs and strategic joint ventures and other relationships; cost and availability of high fuel-economy ICE vehicles;
volatility, or a sustained decrease, in the cost of petroleum-based fuel; failure by governments and other third parties to make the
investments necessary to make infrastructure improvements, such as greater availability of cleaner energy grids and EV charging
stations, and to provide economic incentives promoting the adoption of EVs, including those contemplated by the Inflation
Reduction Act; and negative feedback from stakeholders impacting investor and consumer confidence in our company or industry. If
we are unable to successfully deliver on our EV strategy, it could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial
condition and growth prospects, and could negatively impact our brand and reputation.
Our near-term profitability is dependent upon the success of our current line of full-size ICE SUVs and full-size ICE pickup
trucks. While we offer a broad portfolio of cars, crossovers, SUVs and trucks, and we have announced significant plans to design,
build and sell a broad portfolio of EVs, we currently recognize the highest profit margins on our full-size ICE SUVs and full-size
ICE trucks. As a result, our near-term success is dependent upon our ability to sell higher margin vehicles in sufficient volumes. We
are also using the cash generated by our ICE vehicles to fund our growth strategy, including with respect to EVs and AVs. Any near-
term shift in consumer preferences toward smaller, more fuel-efficient vehicles, whether as a result of increases in the price of oil or
any sustained shortage of oil, including as a result of global political instability (such as related to Russia's invasion of Ukraine),
concerns about fuel consumption or GHG emissions, or other reasons, could weaken the demand for our higher margin vehicles.
More stringent fuel economy regulations could also impact our ability to sell these vehicles or could result in additional costs
associated with these vehicles. See “Our operations and products are subject to extensive laws, regulations and policies, including
those related to vehicle emissions and fuel economy standards, which can significantly increase our costs and affect how we do
business.”
We operate in a highly competitive industry that has historically had excess manufacturing capacity, and attempts by our
competitors to sell more vehicles could have a significant negative effect on our vehicle pricing, market share and operating
results. The global automotive industry is highly competitive in terms of the quality, innovation, new technologies, pricing, fuel
economy, reliability, safety, customer service and financial services offered. Additionally, overall manufacturing capacity in the
industry has historically far exceeded demand. In addition, we have made, and plan to continue to make, significant investments in
EV manufacturing capacity based on our expectations for EV demand, which is subject to various risks and uncertainties as
described above. Many manufacturers, including GM, have relatively high fixed labor costs as well as limitations on their ability to
efficiently close facilities and reduce fixed costs, often as a result of collective bargaining agreements. In light of any excess capacity
and high fixed costs, many industry participants have attempted to sell more vehicles by providing subsidized financing or leasing
programs, offering marketing incentives or reducing vehicle prices. As a result, we have had, and may in the future need, to offer
similar incentives, which may result in vehicle prices that do not offset our costs, including any cost increases or the impact of
adverse currency fluctuations, which could affect our profitability. Our competitors may also seek to benefit from economies of scale
by consolidating or entering into other strategic agreements such as alliances or joint ventures intended to enhance their
competitiveness.
Manufacturers in countries that have lower production costs, such as China and India, have become competitors in key emerging
markets and have announced their intention to export their products to established markets as a low-cost alternative to established
entry-level automobiles. In addition, foreign governments may decide to implement tax and other policies that favor their domestic
manufacturers at the expense of international manufacturers, including GM and its joint venture partners. These actions have had,
and are expected to continue to have, a significant negative effect on our vehicle pricing, market share and operating results in these
markets.

Our AV strategy is dependent upon our ability to successfully mitigate unique technological, operational and regulatory risks.
GM Cruise Holdings LLC (Cruise Holdings), our majority-owned subsidiary, is responsible for the development and
commercialization of AV technology. Our AV operations are capital intensive and subject to a variety of risks inherent with the
development of new technologies, including our ability to continue to develop self-driving software and hardware, such as Light
Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensors and other components; access to sufficient capital; risks related to the manufacture of
purpose-built AVs; and significant competition from both established automotive companies and technology companies, some of
which may have more resources and capital to devote to AV technologies than we do. In addition, we face risks related to the
commercial deployment of AVs on our targeted timeline or at all, including consumer acceptance, achievement of adequate safety
and other performance standards and compliance with uncertain, evolving and potentially conflicting federal, state, provincial or
local regulations. Advanced technologies such as AVs present novel issues with which domestic and foreign regulators have only
limited experience, and will be subject to evolving regulatory frameworks. Any current or future regulations in these areas could
impede the successful commercialization of these technologies and impact whether and how these technologies are designed and
integrated into our products, and may ultimately subject us to increased costs and uncertainty. In order for Cruise to successfully
execute its business plan and achieve its revenue targets, legislation and regulations must evolve to permit widespread commercial
AV deployment. To the extent accidents, cybersecurity breaches or other adverse events associated with our autonomous driving
systems occur, we could be subject to liability, reputational harm, government scrutiny and further regulation, and it could deter
consumer adoption of AV technology. Any of the foregoing could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial
condition and growth prospects.
We are subject to risks associated with climate change, including increased regulation of GHG emissions, changing consumer
preferences and other risks related to our transition to EVs and the potential increased impacts of severe weather events on our
operations and infrastructure. Increasing attention to climate change, increasing societal expectations on companies to address
climate change and changes in consumer preferences may result in increased costs, reduced demand for our products, reduced
profits, risks associated with new regulatory requirements, risks to our reputation and the potential for increased litigation and
governmental investigations. Climate change regulations at the federal, state or local level or in international jurisdictions could
require us to further limit emissions associated with customer use of products we sell, change our manufacturing processes or
product portfolio or undertake other activities that may require us to incur additional expense, which may be material. These
requirements may increase the cost of, and/or diminish demand for, our ICE vehicles. See “Our operations and products are subject
to extensive laws, regulations and policies, including those related to vehicle emissions and fuel economy standards, which can
significantly increase our costs and affect how we do business.” In addition, in the U.S. and abroad there are an increasing number of
sustainability-related rules and regulations that have been adopted or proposed. Such regulations may also subject us to new
disclosure requirements, which could result in risks to our reputation or consumer demand for our products if we do not meet
increasingly demanding stakeholder expectations and standards.
Part of our strategy to address these risks includes our transition to EVs, which presents additional risks, including reduced
demand for, and therefore profits from, our ICE vehicles, which we are using to fund our growth strategy; higher costs or reduced
availability of materials related to EV technologies impacting profitability, particularly with respect to batteries and battery raw
material; and risks related to the success of our EV strategy, particularly with respect to advancement of battery cell technology,
charging infrastructure and competition. See “Our long-term strategy is dependent upon our ability to profitably deliver a broad
portfolio of EVs” and “Our near-term profitability is dependent upon the success of our current line of full-size ICE SUVs and full-
size ICE pickup trucks.”
Finally, increased intensity, frequency or duration of storms, droughts or other severe weather events as a result of climate change
may disrupt our production and the production, logistics, cost and procurement of products from our suppliers and timely delivery of
vehicles to customers, and could negatively impact working conditions at our plants and those of our suppliers. Such weather events
may also adversely impact the financial condition of our customers, and thereby reduce demand for our products and services. Any
of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
Risks related to our operations
Our business is highly dependent upon global automobile market sales volume, which can be volatile. Because we have a high
proportion of relatively fixed structural costs, small changes in sales volume can have a disproportionately large effect on our
profitability. A number of economic and market conditions drive changes in new vehicle sales, including disruptions in the new
vehicle supply chain, the availability and prices of used vehicles, levels of unemployment and inflation, availability of affordable
financing, fluctuations in the cost of fuel, consumer confidence and demand for vehicles, political unrest or uncertainty, the
occurrence of a public health crisis, barriers to trade and other global economic conditions. For a discussion of economic and market
trends, see the "Overview" section in Part II, Item 7. MD&A. If our operating environment deteriorates for these or other reasons,
such as a moderate to severe recession, it could lead to a significant decrease in new vehicle sales, which could materially and
adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.

GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES
Inflationary pressures and persistently high prices and uncertain availability of commodities, raw materials or other inputs
used by us and our suppliers, or instability in logistics and related costs, could negatively impact our profitability. Increases in
prices, including as a result of inflation and rising interest rates, for commodities, raw materials or other inputs that we and our
suppliers use in manufacturing products, systems, components and parts, such as steel, precious metals, non-ferrous metals, critical
minerals or other similar raw materials, or increases in logistics and related costs, have led and may continue to lead to higher
production costs for parts, components and vehicles. In addition, any increase in the cost, or reduced availability, of critical materials
for our EV propulsion systems, including lithium, nickel, cobalt and certain rare earth metals, could lead to higher production costs
for our EVs and could impede our ability to successfully deliver on our EV strategy. Further, increasing global demand for, and
uncertain supply of, such materials could disrupt our or our suppliers’ ability to obtain such materials in a timely manner and/or
could lead to increased costs. Geopolitical risk, fluctuations in supply and demand, fluctuations in interest rates, any weakening of
the U.S. dollar and other economic and political factors have created and may continue to create pricing pressure for commodities,
raw materials and other inputs. These inflationary pressures could, in turn, negatively impact our profitability because we may not be
able to pass all of those costs on to our customers or require our suppliers to absorb such costs.
Our business in China subjects us to unique operational, competitive and regulatory risks. Our business in China is subject to
aggressive competition from many of the largest global manufacturers and numerous domestic manufacturers as well as non-
traditional market participants, such as domestic technology companies. In addition, our success in China depends upon our ability
to adequately address unique market and consumer preferences driven by advancements related to EVs, infotainment, software-
enabled connected services and other new technologies. Our ability to fully deploy our technologies in China may be impacted by
evolving laws and regulations in the U.S. and China. Increased competition, continued U.S.-China trade tensions or weakening
economic conditions in China, among other factors, may result in cost increases, price reductions, reduced sales, profitability and
margins, and challenges to gaining or holding market share. In addition, the public health and policy response to COVID-19 in
China may continue to present geopolitical, macroeconomic and operating challenges.
Certain risks and uncertainties of doing business in China are solely within the control of the Chinese government, and Chinese
law regulates the scope of our investments and business conducted within China. The Chinese government may adopt new
regulations that may impact entities operating in China, potentially with little advance notice. In order to maintain access to the
Chinese market, we may be required to comply with significant technical and other regulatory requirements, including under such
regulatory actions, that are unique to the Chinese market, at times with short notice. These actions may increase the cost of doing
business in China or limit how we may do business in China, which could materially and adversely affect the profitability and
financial condition of our China business.
We benefit from many ongoing strategic business relationships, and a significant amount of our operations are conducted by
joint ventures, which we cannot operate solely for our benefit. We are engaged in many strategic business relationships, and we
expect that such arrangements will continue to be an important factor in the growth and success of our business, particularly in light
of industry consolidation. However, there are no assurances that we will be able to identify or secure suitable business relationships
in the future or that our competitors will not capitalize on such opportunities before we do, or that any strategic business
relationships that we enter into will be successful. If we are unable to successfully source and execute on strategic business
relationships in the future, our overall growth could be impaired, and our business, prospects and results of operations could be
materially adversely affected. In particular, to secure critical materials for production of EVs, we have entered, and plan to continue
to enter, into offtake agreements with raw material suppliers and make investments in certain raw material suppliers. The terms of
these offtake agreements may obligate us to purchase defined quantities of output over a specified period of time, subject to certain
conditions. If we are unable to utilize or otherwise monetize the raw materials we are obligated to purchase under these offtake
agreements, it could materially adversely affect our cash flows and increase our inventory.
In addition, many of our operations, primarily in China and Korea as well as certain of our battery manufacturing operations in the
U.S. and Canada, are carried out by joint ventures. In joint ventures we share ownership and management of a company with one or
more parties who may not have the same goals, strategies, priorities or resources as we do and may compete with us outside the joint
venture. Joint ventures are intended to be operated for the benefit of all co-owners, rather than for our exclusive benefit. Operating a
business as a joint venture often requires additional organizational formalities as well as time-consuming procedures for sharing
information and making decisions that must further take into consideration our partners' interests. In joint ventures we are required
to foster our relationships with our co-owners as well as promote the overall success of the joint venture, and if a co-owner changes,
relationships deteriorate or strategic objectives diverge, our success in the joint venture may be materially adversely affected.
Further, some of the benefits from a successful joint venture are shared among the co-owners, therefore we do not receive all the
benefits from our successful joint ventures.
In addition, because we share ownership and management with one or more parties, we may have limited control over the actions
of a joint venture, particularly when we own a minority interest. As a result, we may be unable to prevent violations of applicable
laws or other misconduct by a joint venture or the failure to satisfy contractual obligations by one or more parties. Moreover, a joint
venture may not be subject to the same financial reporting, corporate governance, or compliance approaches
17

GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES
that we follow. To the extent another party makes decisions that negatively impact the joint venture or internal control issues arise
within the joint venture, we may have to take responsive actions, or we may be subject to penalties, fines or other punitive actions
for these activities.
The international scale and footprint of our operations expose us to additional risks. We manufacture, sell and service products
globally and rely upon an integrated global supply chain to deliver the raw materials, components, systems and parts that we need to
manufacture our products. Our global operations subject us to extensive domestic and foreign legal and regulatory requirements, and
a variety of other political, economic and regulatory risks, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or
results of operations, including: (1) changes in government leadership; (2) changes in trade compliance, labor, employment, tax,
privacy, environmental and other laws, regulations or government policies impacting our overall business model or practices or
restricting our ability to manufacture, purchase or sell products consistent with market demand and our business objectives; (3)
political pressures to change any aspect of our business model or practices or that impair our ability to source raw materials,
services, components, systems and parts, or manufacture products on competitive terms in a manner consistent with our business
objectives (including with respect to full utilization of the incentives contemplated by the Inflation Reduction Act); (4) political
uncertainty, instability, civil unrest, government controls over certain sectors (including as a result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine
and related impacts of the global supply of oil and other raw materials) or human rights concerns; (5) political and economic
tensions between governments and changes in international economic policies, including restrictions on the repatriation of dividends
or in the export of technology, especially between China and the U.S.; (6) changes to customs requirements or procedures (e.g.,
inspections) or new or higher tariffs, for example, on products imported into or exported from the U.S., including under U.S. or other
trade laws or measures; (7) new or evolving non-tariff barriers or domestic preference procurement requirements, or enforcement of,
changes to, withdrawals from or impediments to implementing free trade agreements, or preferences of foreign nationals for
domestically manufactured products; (8) changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly in Brazil and Argentina, and
interest rates; (9) economic downturns or significant changes in conditions in the countries in which we operate; (10) differing local
product preferences and product requirements, including government certification requirements related to, among other things, fuel
economy, vehicle emissions, EVs and AVs, connected services and safety; (11) impact of changes to and compliance with U.S. and
foreign countries’ export controls, economic sanctions and other similar measures; (12) liabilities resulting from U.S. and foreign
laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, those related to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and certain other anti-
corruption laws; (13) differing labor regulations, agreements, requirements and union relationships; (14) differing dealer and
franchise regulations and relationships; (15) difficulties in obtaining financing in foreign countries for local operations; and (16)
natural disasters, public health crises, including the occurrence of a contagious disease or illness, such as COVID-19, and other
catastrophic events.
Any significant disruption at one of our manufacturing facilities could disrupt our production schedule. We assemble vehicles
at various facilities around the world. Our facilities are typically designed to produce particular models for particular geographic
markets. No single facility is designed to manufacture our full range of vehicles. In some cases, certain facilities produce products,
systems, components and parts that disproportionately contribute a greater degree to our profitability than others and create
significant interdependencies among manufacturing facilities around the world. When these or other facilities become unavailable
either temporarily or permanently for any number of reasons, including labor disruptions, supply chain disruptions, the occurrence of
a contagious disease or illness or catastrophic weather events, whether or not as a result of climate change, the inability to
manufacture at the affected facility has resulted, and may in the future result, in harm to our reputation, increased costs, lower
revenues and the loss of customers. We may not be able to easily shift production to other facilities or to make up for lost
production. Any new facility needed to replace an inoperable manufacturing facility would need to comply with the necessary
regulatory requirements, need to satisfy our specialized manufacturing requirements and require specialized equipment.
In addition, substantially all of our hourly employees are represented by unions and covered by collective bargaining agreements
that must be negotiated from time-to-time, including at the local facility level. In 2023, our collective bargaining agreements with
the UAW in the United States and Unifor in Canada, as well as collective bargaining agreements in Mexico, will expire, which will
require negotiation of new agreements. As a result, we may be subject to an increased risk of strikes, work stoppages or other types
of conflicts with labor unions and employees.
Disruption in our suppliers’ operations have disrupted, and could in the future disrupt, our production schedule. Our
automotive operations are dependent upon the continued ability of our suppliers to deliver the systems, components, raw materials
and parts that we need to manufacture our products. Our use of “just-in-time” manufacturing processes allows us to maintain
minimal inventory. As a result, our ability to maintain production is dependent upon our suppliers delivering sufficient quantities of
systems, components, raw materials and parts on time to meet our production schedules. In some instances, we purchase systems,
components, raw materials and parts that are ultimately derived from a single source and may be at an increased risk for supply
disruptions. Any number of factors, including labor disruptions, catastrophic weather events, the occurrence of a public health crisis,
such as a global pandemic, contractual or other disputes, unfavorable economic or industry conditions, delivery delays or other
performance problems or financial difficulties or solvency problems, could disrupt our
18
Table of Contents
GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES
suppliers’ operations and lead to uncertainty in our supply chain or cause supply disruptions for us, which could, in turn, disrupt our
operations, including the production of certain higher margin vehicles. If the COVID-19 pandemic continues to spread or reemerges
and results in a prolonged period of travel, commercial, social and other similar restrictions, we could experience continued and/or
additional global supply disruptions. When we experience supply disruptions, we may not be able to develop alternate sourcing
quickly. Any disruption of our production schedule caused by an unexpected shortage of systems, components, raw materials or
parts even for a relatively short period of time could cause us to alter production schedules, increase work-in-process inventory or
suspend production entirely, which could cause a loss of revenues or an increase in working capital, which would adversely affect
our profitability and financial condition.
In particular, while the global semiconductor supply shortage is easing, it has had, and is continuing to have, wide-ranging effects
across multiple industries, particularly the automotive industry, and it has impacted multiple suppliers that incorporate
semiconductors into the parts they supply to us. As a result, the semiconductor supply shortage has had, and depending on how long
it persists, could continue to have, a material impact on our operations.
Pandemics, epidemics, disease outbreaks and other public health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have disrupted our
business and operations, and future public health crises could materially adversely impact our business, financial condition,
liquidity and results of operations. Pandemics, epidemics or disease outbreaks in the U.S. or globally, including the COVID-19
pandemic, has disrupted, and may in the future disrupt, our business, which could materially affect our results of operations,
financial condition, liquidity and future expectations. Any such events may adversely impact our global supply chain and global
manufacturing operations and cause us to again suspend our operations in the U.S., China and elsewhere. In particular, we could
experience among other things: (1) continued or additional global supply disruptions, including a delayed recovery from the global
semiconductor supply shortage; (2) labor disruptions; (3) an inability to manufacture; (4) an inability to sell to our customers; (5) a
decline in showroom traffic and customer demand during and following the pandemic; (6) customer defaults on automobile loans
and leases; (7) lower than expected pricing on vehicles sold at auction; and (8) an impaired ability to access credit and the capital
markets. Any new pandemic or other public health crises, or future public health crises, could have a material impact on our
business, financial condition and results of operations going forward.
Risks related to our intellectual property, cybersecurity, information technology and data management practices
Competitors may independently develop products and services similar to ours, and there are no guarantees that GM’s
intellectual property rights would prevent competitors from independently developing or selling those products and services.
There may be instances where, notwithstanding our intellectual property position, competitive products or services may impact the
value of our brands and other intangible assets, and our business may be adversely affected. Moreover, although GM takes
reasonable steps to maintain the confidentiality of GM proprietary information, there can be no assurance that such efforts will
completely deter or prevent misappropriation or improper use of our intellectual property. We sometimes face attempts to gain
unauthorized access to our information technology networks and systems for the purpose of improperly acquiring our trade secrets
or confidential business information. The theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business
information as a result of such an incident could adversely affect our competitive position. In addition, we have been, and in the
future may be, the target of patent enforcement actions by third parties, including aggressive and opportunistic enforcement claims
by non-practicing entities. Regardless of the merit of such claims, responding to infringement claims can be expensive and time-
consuming. Although we have taken steps to mitigate such risks, if we are found to have infringed any third-party intellectual
property rights, we could be required to pay substantial damages, or we could be enjoined from offering some of our products and
services. In addition, to prevent unauthorized use of our intellectual property, it may be necessary to prosecute actions for
infringement, misappropriation or other violation of our intellectual property against third parties. Any such action could result in
significant costs and diversion of our resources and management’s attention, and there can be no assurance that we will be successful
in any such action.
Security breaches and other disruptions to information technology systems and networked products, including connected
vehicles, owned or maintained by us, GM Financial, or third-parties, such as vendors or suppliers, could interfere with our
operations and could compromise the confidentiality of private customer data or our proprietary information. We rely upon
information technology systems and manufacture networked and connected products, some of which are managed by third parties, to
process, transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of our business processes, activities and
products. Additionally, we and GM Financial collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property and proprietary business
information (including that of our dealers and suppliers), as well as personally identifiable information of our customers and
employees, in data centers and on information technology networks (including networks that may be controlled or maintained by
third parties). The secure operation of these systems and products, and the processing and maintenance of the information processed
by these systems and products, is critical to our business operations and strategy. Further, customers using our systems rely on the
security of our infrastructure, including hardware and other elements provided by third parties, to ensure the reliability of our
products and the protection of their data. We also face the risk of operational disruption, failure, termination or capacity constraints
of any of the third parties that facilitate our business activities, including vendors, service providers, suppliers, customers,
counterparties, exchanges, clearing agents, clearinghouses or other financial
19
Table of Contents
GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES
intermediaries. Such parties and other third parties who provide us services or with whom we communicate could also be the source
of a cyberattack on, or breach of, our operational systems, network, data or infrastructure. Despite our security measures and
business continuity plans, our information technology systems and networked and connected products may be vulnerable to damage,
disruptions or shutdowns caused by attacks by hackers, computer viruses, malware (including “ransomware”), phishing attacks or
breaches due to errors or malfeasance by employees, contractors and others who have access to these systems and products.
Techniques used in cybersecurity attacks to obtain unauthorized access, disable or sabotage information technology systems change
frequently, as data breaches and other cybersecurity events have become increasingly commonplace, including as a result of the
intensification of state-sponsored cybersecurity attacks during periods of geopolitical conflict, such as the ongoing conflict in
Ukraine. The occurrence of any of these events could compromise the confidentiality, operational integrity and accessibility of these
systems and products and the data that resides within them. Similarly, such an occurrence could result in the compromise or loss of
the information processed by these systems and products. Such events could result in, among other things, the loss of proprietary
data, interruptions or delays in our business operations and damage to our reputation. In addition, such events could increase the risk
of claims alleging that we are non-compliant with applicable laws or regulations, subjecting us to potential liability or regulatory
penalties and related costs under laws protecting the privacy of personal information; disrupt our operations; or reduce the
competitive advantage we hope to derive from our investment in advanced technologies. Various events described above have
occurred in the past and may occur in the future. Although impacts of past events have been immaterial, the impacts of such events
in the future may be material.
Security breaches and other disruptions of our in-vehicle systems could impact the safety of our customers and reduce
confidence in GM and our products. Our vehicles contain complex information technology systems. These systems control various
vehicle functions including engine, transmission, safety, steering, navigation, acceleration, braking, window, door lock functions and
battery and electric motors. We have designed, implemented and tested security measures intended to prevent unauthorized access to
these systems. However, hackers have reportedly attempted, and may attempt in the future, to gain unauthorized access to modify,
alter and use such systems to gain control of, or to change, our vehicles’ functionality, user interface and performance characteristics,
or to gain access to data stored in or generated by the vehicle. Any unauthorized access to or control of our vehicles or their systems
could adversely impact the safety of our customers or result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or regulatory penalties. Laws
that would permit third-party access to vehicle data and related systems could expose our vehicles and vehicle systems to third-party
access without appropriate security measures in place, leading to new safety and security risks for our customers and reducing
customer trust and confidence in our products. In addition, regardless of their veracity, reports of unauthorized access to our vehicles
or their systems could negatively affect our brand and harm our reputation, which could adversely impact our business and operating
results.
Our enterprise data practices, including the collection, use, sharing and security of the Personal Identifiable Information of
our customers, employees and suppliers, are subject to increasingly complex and restrictive regulations in all key market regions.
Under these regulations, the failure to maintain compliant data practices could result in consumer complaints and regulatory inquiry,
resulting in civil or criminal penalties, as well as brand impact or other harm to our business. In addition, increased consumer
sensitivity to real or perceived failures in maintaining acceptable data practices could damage our reputation and deter current and
potential users or customers from using our products and services. The cost of compliance with these laws and regulations will be
high and is likely to increase in the future. The growing patchwork of state and country regulations imposes burdensome obligations
on companies to quickly respond to consumer requests, such as requests to delete, disclose and stop selling personal information,
with significant fines for noncompliance. Complying with these new laws has significantly increased, and may continue to increase,
our operating costs and is driving increased complexity in our operations.
Risks related to government regulations and litigation
Our operations and products are subject to extensive laws, regulations and policies, including those related to vehicle
emissions and fuel economy standards, which can significantly increase our costs and affect how we do business. We are
significantly affected by governmental regulations on a global basis that can increase costs related to the production of our vehicles
and affect our product portfolio, particularly regulations relating to fuel economy standards and GHG emissions. Meeting or
exceeding the requirements of these regulations is costly, often technologically challenging and may require phase-out of internal
combustion propulsion in certain major jurisdictions, and these standards are often not harmonized across jurisdictions. We
anticipate that the number and extent of these and other regulations, laws and policies, and the related costs and changes to our
product portfolio, may increase significantly in the future, primarily motivated by efforts to reduce GHG emissions. Specifically,
fuel economy and GHG emission regulations at the federal, state or local level or in international jurisdictions could require us to
further limit the sale of certain profitable products, subsidize the sale of less profitable ones, change our manufacturing processes,
pay penalties or undertake other activities that may require us to incur additional expense, which may be material. These
requirements may increase the cost of, and/or diminish demand for, our vehicles. These regulatory requirements, among others,
could significantly affect our plans for global product development and, given the uncertainty surrounding enforcement and
regulatory definitions and interpretations, may result in substantial costs, including civil or criminal penalties. In addition, an
evolving but un-harmonized emissions and fuel economy regulatory framework that could include specific sales mandates may limit
or dictate the types of vehicles we sell and where we sell them, which can
20
Table of Contents
GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES
affect our revenues. Refer to the “Environmental and Regulatory Matters” section of Item 1. Business for further information on
regulatory and environmental requirements.
We expect that to comply with fuel economy and GHG emission standards and mandates to sell specific volumes of ZEV in
certain jurisdictions, we will be required to sell a significant volume of EVs, and potentially develop and implement new
technologies for conventional internal combustion engines, all of which will require substantial investment and expense. There are
limits on our ability to achieve fuel economy improvements over a given time frame, primarily relating to the cost and effectiveness
of available technologies, lack of sufficient consumer acceptance of new technologies and of changes in vehicle mix, lack of
willingness of consumers to absorb the additional costs of new technologies, the appropriateness (or lack thereof) of certain
technologies for use in particular vehicles, the widespread availability (or lack thereof) of supporting infrastructure for new
technologies, especially for EVs, and the human, engineering and financial resources necessary to deploy new technologies across a
wide range of products and powertrains in a short time. There is no assurance that we will be able to produce and sell vehicles that
use such new technologies on a profitable basis or that our customers will purchase such vehicles in the quantities necessary for us to
comply with current or future regulatory requirements.
In the current uncertain regulatory framework, compliance costs for which we may be responsible and that are not reasonably
estimable could be substantial. Alleged violations of fuel economy or emission standards could result in legal proceedings, the recall
of one or more of our products, negotiated remedial actions, fines, restricted product offerings or a combination of any of those
items. Any of these actions could have a material adverse effect on our profitability, financial condition and operations, including
facility idling, reduced employment, increased costs and loss of revenue.
In addition, many of our advanced technologies, including AVs, present novel issues with which domestic and foreign regulators
have only limited experience, and will be subject to evolving regulatory frameworks. Any current or future regulations in these areas
could impede the successful commercialization of these technologies and impact whether and how these technologies are designed
and integrated into our products, and may ultimately subject us to increased costs and uncertainty.
We could be materially adversely affected by unusual or significant litigation, governmental investigations or other
proceedings. We are subject to legal proceedings in the U.S. and elsewhere involving various issues, including product liability
lawsuits, warranty litigation, class action litigations alleging product defects, emissions litigation, stockholder litigation, labor and
employment litigation and claims and actions arising from restructurings and divestitures of operations and assets. In addition, we
are subject to governmental proceedings and investigations. A negative outcome in one or more of these legal proceedings could
result in the imposition of damages, including punitive damages, fines, reputational harm, civil lawsuits and criminal penalties,
interruptions of business, modification of business practices, equitable remedies and other sanctions against us or our personnel as
well as legal and other costs, all of which may be significant. For a further discussion of these matters refer to Note 16 to our
consolidated financial statements.
The costs and effect on our reputation of product safety recalls and alleged defects in products and services could materially
adversely affect our business. Government safety standards require manufacturers to remedy certain product safety defects through
recall campaigns and vehicle repurchases. Under these standards, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties or may incur
various costs, including significant costs for repairs made at no cost to the consumer. The costs we incur in connection with these
recalls typically include the cost of the part being replaced and labor to remove and replace the defective part. The costs to complete
a recall could be exacerbated to the extent that such action relates to a global platform. Concerns about the safety of our products,
including advanced technologies like AVs, whether raised internally or by regulators or consumer advocates, and whether or not
based on scientific evidence or supported by data, can result in product delays, recalls, field actions, lost sales, governmental
investigations, regulatory action, private claims, lawsuits and settlements and reputational damage. These circumstances can also
result in damage to brand image, brand equity and consumer trust in our products and ability to lead the disruption occurring in the
automotive industry.
We currently source a variety of systems, components, raw materials and parts from third parties. From time to time these items
may have performance or quality issues that could harm our reputation and cause us to incur significant costs, particularly if the
affected items relate to global platforms or involve defects that are identified years after production. Our ability to recover costs
associated with recalls or other campaigns caused by parts or components purchased from suppliers may be limited by the suppliers’
financial condition or a number of other reasons or defenses.
We may incur additional tax expense or become subject to additional tax exposure. We are subject to the tax laws and
regulations of the U.S. and numerous other jurisdictions in which we do business. Many judgments are required in determining our
worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities, and we are regularly under audit by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service
and other tax authorities, which may not agree with our tax positions. In addition, our tax liabilities are subject to other significant
risks and uncertainties, including those arising from potential changes in laws and regulations in the countries in which we do
business, the possibility of adverse determinations with respect to the application of existing laws (in

particular with respect to full realization of the incentives contemplated by the Inflation Reduction Act), changes in our business or
structure and changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities. Any unfavorable resolution of these and other
uncertainties may have a significant adverse impact on our tax rate and results of operations. If our tax expense were to increase, or
if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our operating results, cash
flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.
Risks related to Automotive Financing - GM Financial
We rely on GM Financial to provide financial services to our customers and dealers. GM Financial faces a number of business,
economic and financial risks that could impair its access to capital and negatively affect its business and operations, which in turn
could impede its ability to provide leasing and financing to customers and commercial lending to our dealers. Any reduction in GM
Financial’s ability to provide such financial services would negatively affect our efforts to support additional sales of our vehicles
and expand our market penetration among customers and dealers.
The primary factors that could adversely affect GM Financial’s business and operations and reduce its ability to provide financing
services at competitive rates include the sufficiency, availability and cost of sources of financing, including credit facilities,
securitization programs and secured and unsecured debt issuances; the performance of loans and leases in its portfolio, which could
be materially affected by charge-offs, delinquencies and prepayments; wholesale auction values of used vehicles; vehicle return rates
and the residual value performance on vehicles GM Financial leases to customers; fluctuations in interest rates and currencies;
competition for customers from commercial banks, credit unions and other financing and leasing companies; and changes to
regulation, supervision, enforcement and licensing across various jurisdictions.
In addition, GM Financial has certain floating-rate obligations, hedging transactions and floating-rate dealer loans that determine
their applicable interest rate or payment amount by reference to the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). The United Kingdom
Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, has announced that it will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates
for the calculation of LIBOR. In March 2021, the ICE Benchmark Administration Limited, the administrator of LIBOR, extended
the transition dates of certain U.S. Dollar LIBOR tenors to June 30, 2023, after which LIBOR reference rates will cease to be
provided. Despite this deferral, the LIBOR administrator has advised that no new contracts using U.S. Dollar LIBOR should be
entered into after December 31, 2021. It is unknown whether LIBOR will continue to be published by its administrator based on
continued bank submissions or on any other basis, after such dates. There is a risk that continued developments, modifications, or
other reforms effecting the discontinuation of LIBOR may impact GM Financial's ability to manage interest rate risk effectively.
Further, as an entity operating in the financial services sector, GM Financial is required to comply with a wide variety of laws and
regulations that may be costly to adhere to and may affect our consolidated operating results. Compliance with these laws and
regulations requires that GM Financial maintain forms, processes, procedures, controls and the infrastructure to support these
requirements, and these laws and regulations often create operational constraints both on GM Financial’s ability to implement
servicing procedures and on pricing. Laws in the financial services industry are designed primarily for the protection of consumers.
The failure to comply with these laws could result in significant statutory civil and criminal penalties, monetary damages, attorneys’
fees and costs, possible revocation of licenses and damage to reputation, brand and valued customer relationships.
Risks related to defined benefit pension plans
Our pension funding requirements could increase significantly due to a reduction in funded status as a result of a variety of
factors, including weak performance of financial markets, declining interest rates, changes in laws or regulations, or changes in
assumptions or investments that do not achieve adequate returns. Our employee benefit plans currently hold a significant amount
of equity and fixed income securities. A detailed description of the investment funds and strategies and our potential funding
requirements are disclosed in Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements, which also describes significant concentrations of
risk to the plan investments.
Our future funding requirements for our defined benefit pension plans depend upon the future performance of assets placed in
trusts for these plans, the level of interest rates used to determine funding levels, the level of benefits provided for by the plans and
any changes in laws and regulations. Future funding requirements generally increase if the discount rate decreases or if actual asset
returns are lower than expected asset returns, assuming other factors are held constant. We estimate future contributions to these
plans using assumptions with respect to these and other items. Changes to those assumptions could have a significant effect on
future contributions.
There are additional risks due to the complexity and magnitude of our investments. Examples include implementation of
significant changes in investment policy, insufficient market liquidity in particular asset classes and the inability to quickly rebalance
illiquid and long-term investments.

GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES
Factors that affect future funding requirements for our U.S. defined benefit plans generally affect the required funding for non-
U.S. plans. Certain plans outside the U.S. do not have assets and therefore the obligation is funded as benefits are paid. If local legal
authorities increase the minimum funding requirements for our non-U.S. plans, we could be required to contribute more funds,
which could negatively affect our liquidity and financial condition.

We have manufacturing, assembly, distribution, office or warehousing operations in 29 countries, including equity interests in
associated companies, which perform manufacturing, assembly or distribution operations. The major facilities outside the U.S.,
which are principally vehicle manufacturing and assembly operations, are located in Brazil, Canada, China, Mexico and South
Korea.
GM Financial owns or leases facilities for administration and regional credit centers. GM Financial has 35 facilities, of which 22
are located in the U.S. The major facilities outside the U.S. are located in Brazil, Canada, China and Mexico.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings
SEC regulations require us to disclose certain information about environmental proceedings if a governmental authority is a party
to such proceedings and such proceedings involve potential monetary sanctions that we reasonably believe will exceed a stated
threshold. Pursuant to the SEC regulations, the Company will use a threshold of $1 million for purposes of determining whether
disclosure of any such proceedings is required.

This MD&A should be read in conjunction with the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements and notes. Forward-

actual results to differ materially from those projected. Refer to the "Forward-Looking Statements" section of this MD&A and Part I,
Item 1A. Risk Factors for a discussion of these risks and uncertainties. The discussion of our financial condition and results of
operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 included in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition

into this MD&A.
Non-GAAP Measures Our non-GAAP measures include: earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT)-adjusted, presented net of
noncontrolling interests; earnings before income taxes (EBT)-adjusted for our GM Financial segment; earnings per share (EPS)-
diluted-adjusted; effective tax rate-adjusted (ETR-adjusted); return on invested capital-adjusted (ROIC-adjusted) and adjusted
automotive free cash flow. Our calculation of these non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other
companies due to potential differences between companies in the method of calculation. As a result, the use of these non-GAAP
measures has limitations and should not be considered superior to, in isolation from, or as a substitute for, related U.S. GAAP
measures.
These non-GAAP measures allow management and investors to view operating trends, perform analytical comparisons and
benchmark performance between periods and among geographic regions to understand operating performance without regard to
items we do not consider a component of our core operating performance. Furthermore, these non-GAAP measures allow investors
the opportunity to measure and monitor our performance against our externally communicated targets and evaluate the investment
decisions being made by management to improve ROIC-adjusted. Management uses these measures in its financial, investment and
operational decision-making processes, for internal reporting and as part of its forecasting and budgeting processes. Further, our
Board of Directors uses certain of these and other measures as key metrics to determine management performance under our
performance-based compensation plans. For these reasons, we believe these non-GAAP measures are useful for our investors.

EBIT-adjusted EBIT-adjusted is presented net of noncontrolling interests and is used by management and can be used by investors
to review our consolidated operating results because it excludes automotive interest income, automotive interest expense and income
taxes as well as certain additional adjustments that are not considered part of our core operations. Examples of adjustments to EBIT
include, but are not limited to, impairment charges on long-lived assets and other exit costs resulting from strategic shifts in our
operations or discrete market and business conditions, and certain costs arising from legal matters. For EBIT-adjusted and our other
non-GAAP measures, once we have made an adjustment in the current period for an item, we will also adjust the related non-GAAP
measure in any future periods in which there is an impact from the item. Our corresponding measure for our GM Financial segment
is EBT-adjusted because interest income and interest expense are part of operating results when assessing and measuring the
operational and financial performance of the segment.
EPS-diluted-adjusted EPS-diluted-adjusted is used by management and can be used by investors to review our consolidated
diluted EPS results on a consistent basis. EPS-diluted-adjusted is calculated as net income attributable to common stockholders-
diluted less adjustments noted above for EBIT-adjusted and certain income tax adjustments divided by weighted-average common
shares outstanding-diluted. Examples of income tax adjustments include the establishment or reversal of significant deferred tax
asset valuation allowances.
ETR-adjusted ETR-adjusted is used by management and can be used by investors to review the consolidated effective tax rate for
our core operations on a consistent basis. ETR-adjusted is calculated as Income tax expense less the income tax related to the
adjustments noted above for EBIT-adjusted and the income tax adjustments noted above for EPS-diluted-adjusted divided by Income
before income taxes less adjustments. When we provide an expected adjusted effective tax rate, we do not provide an expected
effective tax rate because the U.S. GAAP measure may include significant adjustments that are difficult to predict.
ROIC-adjusted ROIC-adjusted is used by management and can be used by investors to review our investment and capital
allocation decisions. We define ROIC-adjusted as EBIT-adjusted for the trailing four quarters divided by ROIC-adjusted average net
assets, which is considered to be the average equity balances adjusted for average automotive debt and interest liabilities, exclusive
of finance leases; average automotive net pension and other postretirement benefits (OPEB) liabilities; and average automotive net
income tax assets during the same period.
Adjusted automotive free cash flow Adjusted automotive free cash flow is used by management and can be used by investors to
review the liquidity of our automotive operations and to measure and monitor our performance against our capital allocation
program and evaluate our automotive liquidity against the substantial cash requirements of our automotive operations. We measure
adjusted automotive free cash flow as automotive operating cash flow from operations less capital expenditures adjusted for
management actions. Management actions can include voluntary events such as discretionary contributions to employee benefit
plans or nonrecurring specific events such as a closure of a facility that are considered special for EBIT-adjusted purposes. Refer to
the “Liquidity and Capital Resources” section of this MD&A for additional information.

Overview Our vision for the future is a world with zero crashes, zero emissions and zero congestion, which guides our growth-
focused strategy to invest in EVs and AVs, software-enabled services and subscriptions and new business opportunities, while
strengthening our market position in profitable ICE vehicles, such as trucks and SUVs. We will execute our strategy with a diverse
team and a steadfast commitment to good citizenship through sustainable operations and a leading health and safety culture.
The automotive industry and GM continue to experience supply chain and logistics disruptions from multiple suppliers that have
impacted, and may continue to impact, our planned production schedules. Despite these challenges, in the second half of 2022, we
experienced improved parts availability that enabled us to increase production and improve dealer inventory levels for certain
vehicles.
In addition, we faced significant inflationary pressure in 2022 that resulted in approximately $5.5 billion in higher commodity and
logistics costs. These increases were more than offset by strong product pricing. While we anticipate incentives to increase from the
low levels in 2022, we expect product pricing to remain strong in 2023, particularly for our full-size SUVs, full-size trucks and
expected new launches. We also expect commodity and logistics cost to improve, but be partially offset by costs we expect to incur
as we strategically localize our battery raw materials supply chain in North America. Refer to the Consolidated Results and regional
analysis sections of this MD&A for additional information.
In 2022, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System raised interest rates to lower the rate of inflation. The higher
interest rate environment did not have a material impact on our 2022 financial results, but we expect it will have an approximately
$1.0 billion unfavorable impact on our results of operations in 2023, as a result of lower forecasted pension income. Refer to the
Critical Accounting Estimates section of this MD&A for additional information including our interest rate sensitivity analysis. We
expect higher interest rates to have an immaterial impact on our Automotive interest expense in 2023, as substantially all of our debt
instruments are fixed rate. For a discussion of the net interest income sensitivity of GM Financial, see Item 7A. Quantitative and
Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Furthermore, holding other factors constant, the higher interest rate environment may
decrease the affordability of our vehicles for customers who rely on financing to purchase a vehicle.
We also face continuing market, operating and regulatory challenges in several countries across the globe due to, among other
factors, competitive pressures, our product portfolio offerings, heightened emission standards, potentially weakening economic
conditions, labor disruptions, foreign exchange volatility, evolving trade policy and political uncertainty. Refer to Part I, Item 1A.
Risk Factors for a discussion of these challenges.
We also continue to monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and government actions and measures taken to prevent its
spread, and the potential to affect our operations. Refer to Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion of these risks.

As we continue to assess our performance and the needs of our evolving business, additional restructuring and rationalization
actions could be required. These actions could give rise to future asset impairments or other charges, which may have a material
impact on our operating results.
On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the “Act”) was signed into law. The Act implements a new 15%
corporate minimum tax based on modified U.S. financial statement net income that is effective beginning in 2023. The new
corporate minimum tax is not expected to have a significant impact on our net earnings or cash flow in 2023. The Act also modified
climate and clean energy corporate tax provisions, including the consumer credit for EV purchases, and beginning in 2023, new tax
credits for commercial EV purchases and investments in clean energy production, supply chains and manufacturing facilities became
effective. We expect to generate commercial EV tax credits and credits from our production of battery components that will increase
net income and impact income tax cash payments. While waiting on pending Department of Treasury regulatory guidance, we are
continuing to evaluate the ultimate impact of the tax credits on our financial results, including our net earnings and cash flow.
For the year ending December 31, 2023, we expect EPS-diluted and EPS-diluted-adjusted of between $6.00 and $7.00, Net
income attributable to stockholders of between $8.7 billion and $10.1 billion and EBIT-adjusted of between $10.5 billion and $12.5
billion. We do not consider the potential impact of future adjustments on our expected financial results.
The following table reconciles expected Net income attributable to stockholders under U.S. GAAP to expected EBIT-adjusted
(dollars in billions):
Year Ending December 31, 2023
Net income attributable to stockholders $ 8.7-10.1
Income tax expense 1.6-2.2
Automotive interest expense, net 0.2

GMNA Industry sales in North America were 17.3 million units in the year ended December 31, 2022, representing a decrease of
6.6% compared to the corresponding period in 2021. U.S. industry sales were 14.2 million units in the year ended December 31,
2022, representing a decrease of 7.9% compared to the corresponding period in 2021. The COVID-19 pandemic originally resulted
in a contraction of total North America industry volumes in 2020 that continued through 2022. Dealer inventory remains constrained
for several critical vehicles, including our full-size SUVs.
Our total vehicle sales in the U.S., our largest market in North America, were 2.3 million units for a market share of 16.0% in the
year ended December 31, 2022, representing an increase of 1.6 percentage points compared to the corresponding period in 2021.
We expect to sustain relatively strong EBIT-adjusted margins in 2023 on the continued strength of vehicle pricing and healthy
U.S. industry light vehicle demand, partially offset by elevated costs associated with commodities, raw materials and logistics. Our
outlook is dependent on the pricing environment, continuing improvement of supply chain availability and overall economic
conditions. As a result of supply chain disruptions in 2022, we experienced interruptions to our planned production schedules and
prioritized production of our most popular and in-demand products, including our full-size trucks, full-size SUVs and EVs.
In 2023, our collective bargaining agreements with the UAW in the United States and Unifor in Canada, as well as collective
bargaining agreements in Mexico, will expire, which will require negotiation of new agreements. Refer to Part I, Item 1A. Risk
Factors for a discussion of the risks related to any significant disruption at one of our manufacturing facilities.
GMI Industry sales in China were 23.5 million units in the year ended December 31, 2022, representing a decrease of 9.2%
compared to the corresponding period in 2021. Our total vehicle sales in China were 2.3 million units resulting in a market share of
9.8% in the year ended December 31, 2022, representing a decrease of 1.4 percentage points compared to the corresponding period
in 2021. The ongoing supply chain disruptions, macro-economic impact of COVID-19 and geopolitical tensions continue to place
pressure on China's automotive industry and our vehicle sales in China. Our Automotive China JVs

generated equity income of $0.7 billion in the year ended December 31, 2022. Although price competition, higher costs associated
with commodities and raw materials, and a more challenging regulatory environment related to emissions, fuel consumption and
NEV requirements will place pressure on our operations in China, we will continue to build upon our strong brands, network, and
partnerships in China as well as drive improvements in vehicle mix and cost.
Outside of China, industry sales were 23.7 million units in the year ended December 31, 2022, representing an increase of 2.5%
compared to the corresponding period in 2021. Our total vehicle sales outside of China were 1.0 million units for a market share of
4.0% in the year ended December 31, 2022, representing an increase of 0.4 percentage points compared to the corresponding period
in 2021.
We historically operated a small import business in Russia and sold GM-badged vehicles into Russia through GM’s alliance
partner in Uzbekistan. GM’s direct and indirect profitability in Russia was insignificant. With Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, western
sanctions on Russia have and may continue to progressively increase. In addition, reputational, legal and other concerns impacted
our ability to continue to operate in Russia. In February 2022, we suspended our exports into Russia and instructed our Russian sales
company to cease selling vehicles within Russia. In April 2022, we took additional actions to extend the suspension of our Russian
business, including the cessation of commercial operations. In November 2022, we shut down our Russia business and recorded a
$0.7 billion charge to write off our net investment and release accumulated translation losses into earnings. The predominately non-
cash charge associated with our exit is considered special for EBIT-adjusted, adjusted automotive free cash flow and EPS-diluted-
adjusted purposes. Currently, we do not believe any loss contingencies arising from our exit are probable and we are unable to
estimate any reasonably possible losses that may result from claims that may be asserted against us by third parties, including retail
customers or government authorities in Russia.
We continue to monitor the situation and its macroeconomic impacts on our financial position and results of operations. Although
we have limited supply chain exposure to Russia and Ukraine, we are working closely with our supply base to mitigate any potential
risks.
Cruise Gated by safety and regulation, Cruise continues to make significant progress towards commercialization of a network of
on-demand AVs in the United States and globally. In 2021, Cruise received a driverless test permit from the California Public
Utilities Commission (CPUC) to provide unpaid rides to the public in driverless vehicles and received approval of its Autonomous
Vehicle Deployment Permit from the California Department of Motor Vehicles to commercially deploy driverless AVs. In June 2022,
Cruise received the first ever Driverless Deployment Permit granted by the CPUC, which allows them to charge a fare for the
driverless rides they are providing to members of the public in certain parts of San Francisco. Additionally, in September 2022,
Cruise acquired regulatory permits to operate driverless ride hail services in Phoenix, Arizona and began pursuing ride hail
operations in Austin, Texas. GM and Cruise are also awaiting a decision on an exemption petition that was filed with NHTSA
seeking regulatory approval for the deployment of the Cruise Origin. Refer to the "Liquidity and Capital Resources" section of this
MD&A for information about GM's additional investment in Cruise.
Automotive Financing - GM Financial Summary and Outlook We believe that offering a comprehensive suite of financing
products will generate incremental sales of our vehicles, drive incremental GM Financial earnings and help support our sales
throughout various economic cycles. GM Financial's leasing program is exposed to residual values, which are heavily dependent on
used vehicle prices. Used vehicle prices were generally higher than contractual residual values in 2022, primarily due to low new
vehicle inventory. In 2023, we expect used vehicle prices to continue moderating through the year as market prices on used vehicles
fall below contractual residual values. The increase in used vehicle prices resulted in gains on terminations of leased vehicles of $1.2
billion in GM Financial interest, operating and other expenses for the year ended December 31, 2022, and $2.0 billion in the
corresponding period in 2021. The following table summarizes the estimated residual value based on GM Financial's most recent
estimates and the number of units included in GM Financial Equipment on operating leases, net by vehicle type (units in thousands):
December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021

GM Financial's penetration of our retail sales in the U.S. was 43% in the year ended December 31, 2022 and 44% in the
corresponding period in 2021. Penetration levels vary depending on incentive financing programs available and competing third-
party financing products in the market. GM Financial's prime loan originations as a percentage of total loan originations in North
America was 80% in the year ended December 31, 2022 and 73% in the corresponding period in 2021. In the year ended December
31, 2022, GM Financial's revenue consisted of leased vehicle income of 61%, retail finance charge income of 32% and commercial
finance charge income of 3%.
Consolidated Results We review changes in our results of operations under five categories: volume, mix, price, cost and other.
Volume measures the impact of changes in wholesale vehicle volumes driven by industry volume, market share and changes in
dealer stock levels. Mix measures the impact of changes to the regional portfolio due to product, model, trim, country and option
penetration in current year wholesale vehicle volumes. Price measures the impact of changes related to Manufacturer’s Suggested
Retail Price and various sales allowances. Cost primarily includes: (1) material and freight; (2) manufacturing, engineering,
advertising, administrative and selling and warranty expense; and (3) non-vehicle related activity. Other primarily includes foreign
exchange and non-vehicle related automotive revenues as well as equity income or loss from our nonconsolidated affiliates. Refer to
the regional sections of this MD&A for additional information.

The most significant element of our Automotive and other cost of sales is material cost, which makes up approximately two-thirds
of the total amount. The remaining portion includes labor costs, depreciation and amortization, engineering, freight and product
warranty and recall campaigns.
Factors that most significantly influence a region's profitability are industry volume, market share, and the relative mix of vehicles
(trucks, crossovers, cars) sold. Variable profit is a key indicator of product profitability. Variable profit is defined as

revenue less material cost, freight, the variable component of manufacturing expense and warranty and recall-related costs. Vehicles
with higher selling prices generally have higher variable profit. Refer to the regional sections of this MD&A for additional
information on volume and mix.
In the year ended December 31, 2022, increased Cost was primarily due to: (1) increased material and freight costs of $5.5 billion;
(2) increased costs of $1.1 billion primarily related to parts and accessories; (3) increased manufacturing costs of $1.1 billion; (4)
increased engineering costs of $1.0 billion primarily related to accelerating our EV portfolio and an increase in development costs as
Cruise progresses towards the commercialization of a network of on-demand AVs in the United States and globally; and (5)
increased costs of $0.8 billion related to modification of Cruise stock incentive awards; partially offset by (6) decreased campaigns
and other warranty-related costs of $0.4 billion; and (7) a decrease of $0.4 billion related to the resolution of substantially all patent
royalty matters accrued with respect to past-year vehicle sales. In the year ended December 31, 2022, favorable Other was due to the
weakening of the Korean Won and other currencies against the U.S. Dollar, partially offset by the strengthening of the Brazilian Real
and other currencies against the U.S. Dollar.

In the year ended December 31, 2022, Automotive and other selling, general and administrative expense increased primarily due
to: (1) increased advertising, selling, and administrative costs of $1.3 billion; (2) charges of $0.5 billion for strategic activities
related to Buick dealerships; and (3) increased costs of $0.3 billion related to modification of Cruise stock incentive awards.

Income tax expense $ 1,888 $ 2,771 $ 1,774 $ 883 31.9 %
In the year ended December 31, 2022, Income tax expense decreased primarily due to Cruise valuation allowance adjustments,
lower effective tax rate as a result of Cruise reconsolidation and lower pre-tax income. The decrease was partially offset by absence
of tax benefit related to a deduction for an investment in a subsidiary, which occurred in the year ended December 31, 2021.
For the year ended December 31, 2022 our ETR-adjusted was 20.2%. We expect our adjusted effective tax rate to be between 16%
and 18% for the year ending December 31, 2023.

due to a decrease in the average balance of the leased vehicles portfolio, and decreased lease termination gains; (2) increased
provision for loan losses of $0.4 billion primarily due to increased loan origination volume in 2022, and the reduction in reserve
levels recorded in 2021 as a result of actual credit performance that was better than forecast and favorable expectations for future
charge-offs and recoveries, as well as an economic forecast weighted more heavily to a weaker outlook as of December 31, 2022;
and (3) increased interest expense of $0.3 billion primarily due to an increased effective rate of interest on our debt; partially offset

Liquidity and Capital Resources We believe our current levels of cash, cash equivalents, marketable debt securities, available
borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facilities and other liquidity actions currently available to us are sufficient to meet our
liquidity requirements. We also maintain access to the capital markets and may issue debt or equity securities, which may provide an
additional source of liquidity. We have substantial cash requirements going forward, which we plan to fund through our total
available liquidity, cash flows from operating activities and additional liquidity measures, if determined to be necessary.
Our known current material uses of cash include, among other possible demands: (1) capital spending and our investments in our
battery cell manufacturing joint ventures of approximately $11.0 billion to $13.0 billion per year through 2025; (2) payments for
engineering and product development activities; (3) payments associated with previously announced vehicle recalls and any other
recall-related contingencies; (4) payments to service debt and other long-term obligations, including discretionary and mandatory
contributions to our pension plans; (5) payments associated with the liquidity program for holders of equity-based incentive awards
issued to employees of Cruise; (6) dividend payments on our common stock that are declared by our Board of Directors; and (7)
payments to purchase shares of our common stock authorized by our Board of Directors. Refer to Note 7, Note 13 and Note 15 to
our consolidated financial statements for additional funding requirements for our operating leases, debt and pension plans. Our
material future uses of cash, which may vary from time to time based on market conditions and other factors, are focused on the
three objectives of our capital allocation program: (1) grow our business at an average target ROIC-adjusted rate of 20% or greater;
(2) maintain a strong investment-grade balance sheet, including a target average automotive cash balance of $18.0 billion; and (3)
after the first two objectives are met, return available cash to shareholders. Our senior management evaluates our capital allocation
program on an ongoing basis and recommends any modifications to the program to our Board of Directors not less than once
annually.
We continue to monitor and evaluate opportunities to strengthen our competitive position over the long term while maintaining a
strong investment-grade balance sheet. These actions may include opportunistic payments to reduce our long-term obligations, as
well as the possibility of acquisitions, dispositions and investments with joint venture partners, as well as strategic alliances that we
believe would generate significant advantages and substantially strengthen our business. To support our transition to EVs, we
anticipate making investments in suppliers or providing funding towards the execution of strategic, multi-year supply agreements to
secure critical materials. In addition, we have entered, and plan to continue to enter, into offtake agreements that generally obligate
us to purchase defined quantities of output. These arrangements could have a short-term adverse impact on our cash and increase our
inventory.
Our liquidity plans are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those described in the "Forward-Looking
Statements" section of this MD&A and Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors, some of which are outside of our control.
In August 2022, our Board of Directors increased the capacity under our previously announced common stock repurchase program

2022, we completed $2.5 billion of repurchases under the program and retired approximately 64 million shares of our common
stock.

In January 2023, we gave notice to early redeem our $1.5 billion 4.875% senior unsecured notes with a maturity date of October
2023. The settlement of the early redemption of these senior unsecured notes is expected to occur during the first quarter of 2023 and
is expected to have an immaterial impact on our 2023 results.
Cash flows that occur amongst our Automotive, Cruise and GM Financial operations are eliminated when we consolidate our cash
flows. Such eliminations include, among other things, collections by Automotive on wholesale accounts receivables financed by
dealers through GM Financial, payments between Automotive and GM Financial for accounts receivables transferred by Automotive
to GM Financial, loans to Automotive and Cruise from GM Financial, dividends issued by GM Financial to Automotive, tax
payments by GM Financial to Automotive and Automotive cash injections in Cruise. The presentation of Automotive liquidity,
Cruise liquidity and GM Financial liquidity presented below includes the impact of cash transactions amongst the sectors that are
ultimately eliminated in consolidation.
Automotive Liquidity Total available liquidity includes cash, cash equivalents, marketable debt securities and funds available
under credit facilities. The amount of available liquidity is subject to seasonal fluctuations and includes balances held by various
business units and subsidiaries worldwide that are needed to fund their operations.
We manage our liquidity primarily at our treasury centers as well as at certain of our significant consolidated overseas
subsidiaries. Over 90% of our cash and marketable debt securities were managed within North America and at our regional treasury
centers at December 31, 2022. We have used, and will continue to use, other methods including intercompany loans to utilize these
funds across our global operations as needed.
Our cash equivalents and marketable debt securities balances are primarily denominated in U.S. Dollars and include investments
in U.S. government and agency obligations, foreign government securities, time deposits, corporate debt securities and mortgage and
asset-backed securities. Our investment guidelines, which we may change from time to time, prescribe certain minimum credit
worthiness thresholds and limit our exposures to any particular sector, asset class, issuance or security type. The majority of our
current investments in debt securities are with A/A2 or better rated issuers.
We use credit facilities as a mechanism to provide additional flexibility in managing our global liquidity. Our Automotive
borrowing capacity under credit facilities totaled $15.5 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, which consisted primarily of two
credit facilities. Total Automotive borrowing capacity under our credit facilities does not include our 364-day, $2.0 billion facility
allocated for exclusive use of GM Financial. We did not have any borrowings against our primary facilities, but had letters of credit
outstanding under our sub-facility of $0.4 billion and $0.3 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021.
In April 2022, we renewed our 364-day, $2.0 billion revolving credit facility allocated for the exclusive use of GM Financial,
which now matures on April 4, 2023. If available capacity permits, GM Financial continues to have access to our automotive credit
facilities. GM Financial did not have borrowings outstanding against any of these facilities at December 31, 2022 and 2021. We had
intercompany loans from GM Financial of $0.2 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, which primarily consisted of commercial
loans to dealers we consolidate. We did not have intercompany loans to GM Financial at December 31, 2022 and 2021. Refer to
Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.
In August 2022, we issued $2.25 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes under our new Sustainable
Finance Framework with a weighted average interest rate of 5.51% and maturity dates in 2029 and 2032. We intend to allocate an
amount equal to the net proceeds from these senior unsecured notes to finance or refinance, in whole or in part, new or existing
green projects, assets or activities undertaken or owned by the Company that meet one or more eligibility criteria outlined in our
Sustainable Finance Framework.

Several of our loan facilities, including our revolving credit facilities, require compliance with certain financial and operational
covenants as well as regular reporting to lenders. We have reviewed our covenants in effect as of December 31, 2022 and determined
we are in compliance and expect to remain in compliance in the future.
In March 2022, under the Share Purchase Agreement, we acquired SoftBank's equity ownership stake in Cruise for $2.1 billion
and, separately, we made an additional $1.35 billion investment in Cruise in place of SoftBank. During the year ended December 31,
2022, we made additional investments in Cruise of $1.1 billion.
In September 2022, we exercised our 39.7 million warrants in Stellantis. Upon exercise, the warrants converted into 69.1 million
common shares of Stellantis, which we immediately sold back to Stellantis. Total net pre-tax proceeds, including dividends received,
in connection with this transaction were approximately $1.1 billion.
GM Financial's Board of Directors declared and paid dividends of $1.7 billion, $3.5 billion, and $0.8 billion on its common stock
in 2022, 2021, and 2020. Future dividends from GM Financial will depend on several factors including business and economic
conditions, its financial condition, earnings, liquidity requirements and leverage ratio.

Cruise Liquidity In January 2022, Cruise Holdings met the requirements for commercial deployment under its agreements with
SoftBank, which triggered SoftBank's obligation to purchase additional Cruise convertible preferred shares for $1.35 billion. In
March 2022, GM made the additional $1.35 billion investment in Cruise in place of SoftBank following GM's acquisition of
SoftBank's equity ownership stake in Cruise pursuant to the Share Purchase Agreement.
Additionally, in March 2022, GM and Cruise announced a liquidity program for holders of equity-based incentive awards issued
to the employees of Cruise pursuant to Cruise's 2018 Employee Incentive Plan, under which GM will purchase newly issued Cruise
Class B Common Shares to fund the tax withholding on vested awards and GM will conduct tender offers for Cruise Class B
Common Shares issued to settle vested awards. During the year ended December 31, 2022, Cruise issued approximately $0.5 billion
of Cruise Class B Common Shares, primarily to us, to fund the payment of statutory tax withholding obligations resulting from the
settlement or exercise of vested awards. Also, GM conducted quarterly tender offers, and paid approximately $0.6 billion in cash to
settle tendered Cruise Class B Common Shares under the announced liquidity program during the year ended December 31, 2022.

Automotive Financing – GM Financial Liquidity GM Financial's primary sources of cash are finance charge income, leasing
income and proceeds from the sale of terminated leased vehicles, net distributions from credit facilities, securitizations, secured and
unsecured borrowings and collections and recoveries on finance receivables. GM Financial's primary uses of cash are purchases and
funding of finance receivables and leased vehicles, repayment or repurchases of secured and unsecured debt, funding credit
enhancement requirements in connection with securitizations and secured credit facilities, interest costs, operating expenses, income
taxes and dividend payments. GM Financial continues to monitor and evaluate opportunities to optimize its liquidity position and the
mix of its debt between secured and unsecured debt. The following table summarizes GM Financial's available liquidity (dollars in
billions):
December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021
Cash and cash equivalents $ 4.0 $ 4.0 
Borrowing capacity on unpledged eligible assets 22.0 19.2 
Borrowing capacity on committed unsecured lines of credit 0.5 0.5 
Borrowing capacity on revolving credit facility, exclusive to GM Financial 2.0 2.0 
Total GM Financial available liquidity $ 28.5 $ 25.7 
In the year ended December 31, 2022, GM Financial's available liquidity increased primarily due to increased available borrowing
capacity on unpledged eligible assets, resulting from the issuance of securitization transactions and unsecured debt. GM Financial
structures liquidity to support at least six months of GM Financial's expected net cash flows, including new originations, without
access to new debt financing transactions or other capital markets activity.
GM Financial has access to $15.5 billion of our revolving credit facilities with exclusive access to the 364-day, $2.0 billion
facility. Refer to the "Automotive Liquidity" section of this MD&A for additional details. We have a support agreement with GM
Financial which, among other things, establishes commitments of funding from us to GM Financial. This agreement also provides
that we will continue to own all of GM Financial’s outstanding voting shares so long as any unsecured debt securities remain
outstanding at GM Financial. In addition, we are required to use our commercially reasonable efforts to ensure GM Financial
remains a subsidiary borrower under our corporate revolving credit facilities.
Credit Facilities In the normal course of business, in addition to using its available cash, GM Financial utilizes borrowings under
its credit facilities, which may be secured or unsecured, and GM Financial repays these borrowings as appropriate under its cash
management strategy. At December 31, 2022, secured, committed unsecured and uncommitted unsecured credit facilities totaled
$26.2 billion, $0.5 billion and $1.4 billion with advances outstanding of $3.9 billion, an insignificant amount and $1.4 billion.

leased vehicle income of $1.2 billion; and (2) a net increase in cash used in counterparty derivative collateral posting activities of
$0.9 billion.
In the year ended December 31, 2022, Net cash used in investing activities increased primarily due to: (1) an increase in purchases
and originations of finance receivables of $6.1 billion; (2) a decrease in collections and recoveries on finance receivables of $0.7
billion; and (3) a decrease in the proceeds from termination of leased vehicles of $0.2 billion; partially offset by (4) a decrease in
purchases of leased vehicles of $2.7 billion.
In the year ended December 31, 2022, Net cash provided by financing activities increased primarily due to: (1) a decrease in debt

LIBOR Transition As discussed in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors, banks will no longer be persuaded or compelled to submit rates
for the calculation of LIBOR. GM Financial established a LIBOR transition initiative in 2019 to evaluate the potential impacts of the
transition, and continues to implement strategies to mitigate the risks associated with the LIBOR discontinuation such as amending
existing LIBOR-based transactions where feasible. GM Financial has only a limited amount of LIBOR-based debt outstanding that
is currently scheduled to mature after June 30, 2023 and if not amendable, would utilize the Alternative Reference Rates Committee
fallback process where applicable. Furthermore, GM Financial has adhered to the International Swaps and Derivatives Association’s
Fallbacks Protocol and is transitioning its existing LIBOR-based derivative exposure in advance of the June 30, 2023 date when
applicable LIBOR will no longer be published. For any residual exposure after the end of 2022, GM Financial expects to leverage
relevant contractual and statutory solutions to transition such exposure.
Critical Accounting Estimates The consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which requires
the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses in the
periods presented. We believe the accounting estimates employed are appropriate and the resulting balances are reasonable;
however, due to the inherent uncertainties in developing estimates, actual results could differ from the original estimates, requiring
adjustments to these balances in future periods. Refer to Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for our significant
accounting policies related to our critical accounting estimates.
Product Warranty and Recall Campaigns The estimates related to product warranties are established using historical information
on the nature, frequency and average cost of claims of each vehicle line or each model year of the vehicle line and assumptions
about future activity and events. When little or no claims experience exists for a model year or a vehicle line, the estimate is based
on comparable models.
We accrue the costs related to product warranty at the time of vehicle sale and we accrue the estimated cost of recall campaigns
when they are probable and estimable.
The estimates related to recall campaigns accrued at the time of vehicle sale are established by applying a paid loss approach that
considers the number of historical recall campaigns and the estimated cost for each recall campaign. These estimates consider the
nature, frequency and magnitude of historical recall campaigns, and use key assumptions including the number of historical periods
and the weighting of historical data in the reserve studies. Costs associated with recall campaigns not accrued at the time of vehicle
sale are estimated based on the estimated cost of repairs and the estimated vehicles to be repaired. Depending on part availability and
time to complete repairs we may, from time to time, offer courtesy transportation at no cost to our customers. These estimates are re-
evaluated on an ongoing basis and based on the best available information. Revisions are made when necessary based on changes in
these factors.
The estimated amount accrued for recall campaigns at the time of vehicle sale is most sensitive to the estimated number of recall
events, the number of vehicles per recall event, the assumed number of vehicles that will be brought in by customers for repair (take
rate) and the cost per vehicle for each recall event. The estimated cost of a recall campaign that is accrued on an individual basis is
most sensitive to our estimated assumed take rate that is primarily developed based on our historical take rate experience. A 10%
increase in the estimated take rate for all recall campaigns would increase the estimated cost by approximately $0.4 billion.
Actual experience could differ from the amounts estimated requiring adjustments to these liabilities in future periods. Due to the
uncertainty and potential volatility of the factors contributing to developing estimates, changes in our assumptions could materially
affect our results of operations.
Sales Incentives The estimated effect of sales incentives offered to dealers and end customers is recorded as a reduction of
Automotive net sales and revenue at the time of sale. There may be numerous types of incentives available at any particular time.
Incentive programs are generally specific to brand, model or sales region and are for specified time periods, which may be extended.
Significant factors used in estimating the cost of incentives include type of program, forecasted sales volume, product mix, and the
rate of customer acceptance of incentive programs, all of which are estimated based on historical experience and assumptions
concerning future customer behavior and market conditions. A change in any of these factors affecting the estimate could have a
significant effect on recorded sales incentives. A 10% increase in the cost of incentives would increase the sales incentive liability by
an insignificant amount. Subsequent adjustments to incentive estimates are possible as facts and circumstances change over time,
which could affect the revenue previously recognized in Automotive net sales and revenue.

GM Financial Allowance for Loan Losses The GM Financial retail finance receivables portfolio consists of smaller-balance,
homogeneous loans that are carried at amortized cost, net of allowance for loan losses. The allowance for loan losses on retail
finance receivables reflects net credit losses expected to be incurred over the remaining life of the retail finance receivables, which
have a weighted average remaining life of approximately two years. GM Financial forecasts net credit losses based on relevant
information about past events, current conditions and forecast economic performance. GM Financial believes that the allowance is
adequate to cover expected credit losses on the retail finance receivables; however, because the allowance for loan losses is based on
estimates, there can be no assurance that the ultimate charge-off amount will not exceed such estimates or that our credit loss
assumptions will not increase.
GM Financial incorporates its outlook on forecast recovery rates and overall economic performance in its allowance estimate.
Each 5% relative decrease/increase in the forecast recovery rates would increase/decrease the allowance for loan losses by $0.1
billion.
At December 31, 2022, the weightings applied to the economic forecast scenarios considered resulted in an allowance for loan
losses on the retail finance receivables portfolio of $2.1 billion. If the forecast economic conditions were based entirely on the
weakest scenario considered, the allowance for loan losses would increase by $74 million. Actual economic data and recovery rates
that are lower than those forecasted by GM Financial could result in an increase to the allowance for loan losses.
The GM Financial commercial finance receivables portfolio consists of floorplan financing as well as dealer loans, which are
loans to finance improvements to dealership facilities, to provide working capital, or to purchase and/or finance dealership real
estate. The allowance for loan losses on commercial finance receivables is based on historical loss experience for the consolidated
portfolio, in addition to forecasted industry vehicle sales. There can be no assurance that the ultimate charge-off amount will not
exceed such estimates or that GM Financial's credit loss assumptions will not increase.
Valuation of GM Financial Equipment on Operating Lease Assets and Residuals GM Financial has investments in leased
vehicles recorded as operating leases. Each leased asset in the portfolio represents a vehicle that GM Financial owns and has leased
to a customer. At lease inception, an estimate is made of the expected residual value for the vehicle at the end of the lease term,
which typically ranges from two to five years. GM Financial estimates the expected residual value based on third-party data that
considers various data points and assumptions, including, but not limited to, recent auction values, the expected future volume of
returning leased vehicles, significant liquidation of rental or fleet inventory, used vehicle prices, manufacturer incentive programs
and fuel prices.
During the term of a lease, GM Financial periodically evaluates the estimated residual value and may adjust the value downward,
which increases the prospective depreciation, or upward (limited to the contractual residual value), which decreases the prospective
depreciation.
The customer is obligated to make payments during the lease term for the difference between the purchase price and the contract
residual value plus a money factor. However, since the customer is not obligated to purchase the vehicle at the end of the contract,
GM Financial is exposed to a risk of loss to the extent the customer returns the vehicle prior to or at the end of the lease term and the
proceeds GM Financial receives on the disposition of the vehicle are lower than the residual value estimated at lease inception.
Realization of the residual values is dependent on GM Financial's future ability to market the vehicles under prevailing market
conditions.
At December 31, 2022, the estimated residual value of GM Financial's leased vehicles was $24.7 billion. Depreciation reduces the
carrying value of each leased asset in GM Financial's operating lease portfolio over time from its original acquisition value to its
expected residual value at the end of the lease term. If used vehicle prices weaken compared to estimates, GM Financial would
increase depreciation expense and/or record an impairment charge on the lease portfolio. If an impairment exists, GM Financial
would determine any shortfall in recoverability of the leased vehicle asset groups by year, make and model. Recoverability is
calculated as the excess of: (1) the sum of remaining lease payments plus estimated residual value; over (2) leased vehicles, net less
deferred revenue. Alternatively, if used vehicle prices outperform GM Financial's latest estimates, it may record gains on sales of
off-lease vehicles and/or decreased depreciation expense.

GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES
The following table illustrates the effect of a 1% relative change in the estimated residual values at December 31, 2022, which
could increase or decrease depreciation expense over the remaining term of the leased vehicle portfolio, holding all other
assumptions constant (dollars in millions):
Impact to Depreciation
Expense
2023 $ 181 
2024 52 
2025 13 
2026 and thereafter 1 
Total $ 247 
Changes to residual values are rarely simultaneous across all maturities and segments, and also may impact return rates. If a
decrease in residual values is concentrated among specific asset groups, the decrease could result in an immediate impairment
charge. GM Financial reviewed the leased vehicle portfolio for indicators of impairment and determined that no impairment
indicators were present at December 31, 2022 and 2021.
Used vehicle prices decreased since the end of 2021 due to normalization of supply and demand; however, prices remain above
pre-pandemic levels. In 2023, GM Financial expects used vehicle prices to continue moderating through the year.
Pension and OPEB Plans Our defined benefit pension plans are accounted for on an actuarial basis, which requires the selection
of various assumptions, including an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, a discount rate, mortality rates of participants
and expectation of mortality improvement. Our pension obligations include Korean statutory pension payments that are valued on a
walk away basis. The expected long-term rate of return on U.S. plan assets that is utilized in determining pension expense is derived
from periodic studies, which include a review of asset allocation strategies, anticipated future long-term performance of individual
asset classes, risks using standard deviations and correlations of returns among the asset classes that comprise the plans' asset mix.
While the studies give appropriate consideration to recent plan performance and historical returns, the assumptions are primarily
long-term, prospective rates of return.
In December 2022, an investment policy study was completed for the U.S. pension plans. As a result of changes to our capital
market assumptions, the weighted-average long-term rate of return on assets increased from 5.4% at December 31, 2021 to 6.3% at
December 31, 2022. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets used in determining pension expense for non-U.S. plans is
determined in a similar manner to the U.S. plans.
Another key assumption in determining net pension and OPEB expense is the assumed discount rate used to discount plan
obligations. We estimate the assumed discount rate for U.S. plans using a cash flow matching approach, which uses projected cash
flows matched to spot rates along a high quality corporate bond yield curve to determine the weighted-average discount rate for the
calculation of the present value of cash flows. We apply the individual annual yield curve rates instead of the assumed discount rate
to determine the service cost and interest cost, which more specifically links the cash flows related to service cost and interest cost to
bonds maturing in their year of payment.
The Society of Actuaries (SOA) issued mortality improvement tables in the three months ended December 31, 2022. We reviewed
our recent mortality experience and we determined our current mortality assumptions are appropriate to measure our U.S. pension
and OPEB plans obligations as of December 31, 2022.
Significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect the pension obligations.
The effects of actual results differing from assumptions and the changing of assumptions are included in unamortized net actuarial
gains and losses that are subject to amortization to pension expense over future periods. The unamortized pre-tax actuarial loss on
our pension plans was $3.3 billion and $3.7 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021. The year-over-year change is primarily due to
an increase in discount rates partially offset by lower than expected asset returns.
The funded status of the U.S. pension plans improved in the year ended December 31, 2022 to $0.1 billion overfunded status from
$0.3 billion underfunded status primarily due to: (1) the favorable effect of an increase in discount rates of $11.9 billion; and (2)
changes in actuarial assumptions, demographic data updates and contributions of $0.3 billion; partially offset by (3) the unfavorable
effect of negative actual returns on plan assets of $10.3 billion; and (4) service and interest costs of $1.5 billion.

Valuation of Deferred Tax Assets The ability to realize deferred tax assets depends on the ability to generate sufficient taxable
income within the carryback or carryforward periods provided for in the tax law for each applicable tax jurisdiction. The assessment
regarding whether a valuation allowance is required or should be adjusted is based on an evaluation of possible sources of taxable
income and also considers all available positive and negative evidence factors. Our accounting for the valuation of deferred tax
assets represents our best estimate of future events. Changes in our current estimates, due to unanticipated market conditions,
governmental legislative actions or events, could have a material effect on our ability to utilize deferred tax assets. Refer to Note 17
to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on the composition of valuation allowances.
Forward-Looking Statements This report and the other reports filed by us with the SEC from time to time, as well as statements
incorporated by reference herein and related comments by our management, may include "forward-looking statements" within the
meaning of the U.S. federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements are any statements other than statements of historical fact.
Forward-looking statements represent our current judgment about possible future events and are often identified by words like
“aim,” “anticipate,” “appears,” “approximately,” “believe,” “continue,” “could,” “designed,” “effect,” “estimate,” “evaluate,”
“expect,” “forecast,” “goal,” “initiative,” “intend,” “may,” “objective,” “outlook,” “plan,” “potential,” “priorities,” “project,”
“pursue,” “seek,” “should,” “target,” “when,” “will,” “would,” or the negative of any of those words or similar expressions. In
making these statements, we rely on assumptions and analysis based on our experience and perception of historical trends, current
conditions and expected future developments as well as other factors we consider appropriate under the circumstances. We believe
these judgments are reasonable, but these statements are not guarantees of any future events or financial results, and our actual
results may differ materially due to a variety of important factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors, which may
be revised or supplemented in subsequent reports we file with the SEC, include, among others, the following: (1) our ability to
deliver new products, services, technologies and customer experiences in response to increased competition and changing consumer
preferences in the automotive industry; (2) our ability to timely fund and introduce new and improved vehicle models, including
electric vehicles, that are able to attract a sufficient number of consumers; (3) our ability to profitably deliver a broad portfolio of
electric vehicles that will help drive consumer adoption; (4) the success of our current line of full-size SUVs and full-size pickup
trucks; (5) our highly competitive industry, which has been historically characterized by excess manufacturing capacity and the use
of incentives, and the introduction of new and improved vehicle models by our competitors; (6) the unique technological,
operational, regulatory and competitive risks related to the timing and commercialization of autonomous vehicles; (7) risks
associated with climate change, including increased regulation of GHG emissions, our transition to electric vehicles and the potential
increased impacts of severe weather events; (8) global automobile market sales volume, which can be volatile; (9) inflationary
pressures and persistently high prices and uncertain availability of raw materials and commodities used by us and our suppliers, and
instability in logistics and related costs; (10) our business in China, which is subject to unique operational, competitive, regulatory
and economic risks; (11) the success of our ongoing strategic business relationships and of our joint ventures, which we cannot
operate solely for our benefit and over which we may have limited control; (12) the international scale and footprint of our
operations, which exposes us to a variety of unique political, economic, competitive and regulatory risks, including the risk of

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
The overall financial risk management program is under the responsibility of the Chief Financial Officer with support from the
Financial Risk Council, which reviews and, where appropriate, approves strategies to be pursued to mitigate these risks. The
Financial Risk Council comprises members of our management and functions under the oversight of the Audit Committee and
Finance Committee of the Board of Directors. The Audit Committee and Finance Committee assist and guide the Board of Directors
in its oversight of our financial and risk management strategies. A risk management control framework is utilized to monitor the
strategies, risks and related hedge positions in accordance with the policies and procedures approved by the Financial Risk Council.
Our financial risk management policy is designed to protect against risk arising from extreme adverse market movements on our key
exposures.
Automotive The following analyses provide quantitative information regarding exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk and
interest rate risk. Sensitivity analysis is used to measure the potential loss in the fair value of financial instruments with exposure to
market risk. The models used assume instantaneous, parallel shifts in exchange rates and interest rate yield curves. For options and
other instruments with nonlinear returns, models appropriate to these types of instruments are utilized to determine the effect of
market shifts. There are certain shortcomings inherent in the sensitivity analyses presented, primarily due to the assumption that
interest rates change in a parallel fashion and that spot exchange rates change instantaneously. In addition, the analyses are unable to
reflect the complex market reactions that normally would arise from the market shifts modeled and do not contemplate the effects of
correlations between foreign currency exposures and offsetting long-short positions in currency or other exposures, such as interest
rates, which may significantly reduce the potential loss in value.
Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk We have foreign currency exposures related to buying, selling and financing in currencies
other than the functional currencies of our operations. At December 31, 2022, our most significant foreign currency exposures were
between the U.S. Dollar and the Canadian Dollar, Chinese Yuan, Korean Won, Brazilian Real, and Mexican Peso. Derivative
instruments such as foreign currency forwards, swaps and options are primarily used to hedge exposures with respect to forecasted
revenues, costs and commitments denominated in foreign currencies. Such contracts had remaining maturities of up to 12 months at
December 31, 2022.
 
46
Table of Contents
GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES
The net fair value liability of financial instruments with exposure to foreign currency risk was $0.2 billion and $0.7 billion at
December 31, 2022 and 2021. These amounts are calculated utilizing a population of foreign currency exchange derivatives and
foreign currency denominated debt and exclude the offsetting effect of foreign currency cash, cash equivalents and other assets. The
potential loss in fair value for such financial instruments from a 10% adverse change in all quoted foreign currency exchange rates
would have been insignificant at December 31, 2022 and 2021.
We are exposed to foreign currency risk due to the translation and remeasurement of the results of certain international operations
into U.S. Dollars as part of the consolidation process. We had foreign currency derivatives with notional amounts of $4.1 billion and
$4.2 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021. The fair value of these derivative financial instruments was insignificant. Fluctuations
in foreign currency exchange rates can therefore create volatility in the results of operations and may adversely affect our financial
condition.
The following table summarizes the amounts of automotive foreign currency translation and transaction and remeasurement
(gains) losses:
Years Ended December 31,
2022 2021
Translation (gains) losses recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss $ (37)$ (132)
Transaction and remeasurement (gains) losses recorded in earnings $ 173 $ (15)
Interest Rate Risk We are subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates related to certain financial instruments,
primarily debt, finance lease obligations and certain marketable debt securities. We did not have any interest rate swap positions to
manage interest rate exposures in our automotive operations at December 31, 2022 and 2021. The fair value of debt and finance
leases was $16.8 billion and $20.6 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021. The potential increase in fair value resulting from a 10%
decrease in quoted interest rates would have been $0.8 billion and $0.6 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021.     
We had marketable debt securities, including those held by Cruise, of $12.2 billion and $8.6 billion classified as available-for-sale
at December 31, 2022 and 2021. The potential decrease in fair value from a 50 basis point increase in interest rates would have been
insignificant at December 31, 2022 and 2021.
Automotive Financing - GM Financial
Interest Rate Risk Fluctuations in market interest rates can affect GM Financial's gross interest rate spread, which is the difference
between interest earned on finance receivables and interest paid on debt. GM Financial is exposed to interest rate risks as financial
assets and liabilities have different characteristics that may impact financial performance. These differences may include tenor, yield,
re-pricing timing, and prepayment expectations. Typically, retail finance receivables and leases purchased by GM Financial earn
fixed interest and commercial finance receivables originated by GM Financial earn variable interest. GM Financial funds its business
with variable or fixed rate debt. The variable rate debt is subject to adjustments to reflect prevailing market interest rates. To help
mitigate interest rate risk or mismatched funding, GM Financial may employ hedging.
Quantitative Disclosure GM Financial measures the sensitivity of its net interest income to changes in interest rates by using
interest rate scenarios that assume a hypothetical, instantaneous parallel shift of one hundred basis points in all interest rates across
all maturities, as well as a base case that assumes that rates perform at the current market forward curve. However, interest rate
changes are rarely instantaneous or parallel and rates could move more or less than the one percentage point assumed in our analysis.
Therefore, the actual impact to net interest income could be higher or lower than the results detailed in the table below. These
interest rate scenarios are purely hypothetical and do not represent our view of future interest rate movements.
At December 31, 2022 and 2021, GM Financial was liability-sensitive, meaning that more liabilities than assets were expected to
re-price within the next 12 months. During a period of rising interest rates, the interest paid on liabilities would increase more than
the interest earned on assets, which would initially decrease net interest income. During a period of falling interest rates, net interest
income would be expected to initially increase. GM Financial's hedging strategies approved by its Global Asset Liability Committee
are used to manage interest rate risk within policy guidelines.

GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES
The following table presents GM Financial's net interest income sensitivity to interest rate movement:
Years Ended December 31,
2022 2021
One hundred basis points instantaneous increase in interest rates $ (4.3)$ (5.1)
One hundred basis points instantaneous decrease in interest rates(a) $ 4.3 $ 5.1 
__________
(a)    Net interest income sensitivity given a one hundred basis point decrease in interest rates requires an assumption of negative interest rates in
markets where existing interest rates are below one percent.
Additional Model Assumptions The sensitivity analysis presented is GM Financial's best estimate of the effect of the hypothetical
interest rate scenarios; however, actual results could differ. The estimates are also based on assumptions including the amortization
and prepayment of the finance receivable portfolio, originations of finance receivables and leases, refinancing of maturing debt,
replacement of maturing derivatives and exercise of options embedded in debt and derivatives. The prepayment projections are
based on historical experience. If interest rates or other factors change, actual prepayment experience could be different than
projected.
Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk GM Financial is exposed to foreign currency risk due to the translation and
remeasurement of the results of certain international operations into U.S. Dollars as part of the consolidation process. Fluctuations in
foreign currency exchange rates can therefore create volatility in the results of operations and may adversely affect GM Financial's
financial condition.
GM Financial primarily finances its receivables and leased assets with debt in the same currency. When a different currency is
used, GM Financial may use foreign currency swaps to convert substantially all of its foreign currency debt obligations to the local
currency of the receivables and leased assets to minimize any impact to earnings. As a result, GM Financial believes its market risk
exposure relating to changes in currency exchange rates at December 31, 2022 was insignificant.
GM Financial had foreign currency swaps with notional amounts of $6.9 billion and $8.2 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021.
The net fair value of these derivative financial instruments was a liability of $0.6 billion and $0.2 billion at December 31, 2022 and
2021.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of General Motors Company
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of General Motors Company and subsidiaries (the Company) as of
December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, cash flows, and equity for each
of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial
statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at
December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)
(PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal
Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013
framework) and our report dated January 31, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to
be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or
fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether
due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis,
evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial
statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were
communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material
to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of
critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by
communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or
disclosures to which they relate.
Product warranty and recall campaigns
Description of the matter As discussed in Note 12 to the financial statements, the liabilities for product warranty and recall
campaigns amount to $8.5 billion at December 31, 2022. The Company accrues for costs related to
product warranty at the time of vehicle sale and accrues the estimated cost of recall campaigns when
they are probable and estimable.
Auditing these liabilities involved a high degree of subjectivity in evaluating management’s
estimates, due to the size, uncertainties, and potential volatility related to the estimated liabilities.
Management’s estimates consider historical claims experience, including the nature, frequency, and
average cost of claims of each vehicle line or each model year of the vehicle line, and the key
assumptions of historical data being predictive of future activity and events, in particular, the
number of historical periods used and the weighing of historical data in the reserve studies.
49
Table of Contents
How we addressed the matter
in our auditWe evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls over the
Company’s product warranty and recall campaign processes. We tested internal controls over
management’s review of the valuation models and significant assumptions for product warranty and
recall, including the warranty claims forecasted based on the frequency and average cost per
warranty claim for product warranty, and the cost estimates related to recall campaigns. Our audit
also included the evaluation of controls that address the completeness and accuracy of the data
utilized in the valuation models.
Our audit procedures related to product warranty and recall campaigns also included, among others,
evaluating the Company’s estimation methodology, the related significant assumptions and
underlying data, and performing analytical procedures to corroborate cost per vehicle based on
historical claims data. Furthermore, we performed sensitivity analyses to evaluate the significant
judgments made by management, including cost estimates to evaluate the impact on reserves from
changes in assumptions. We performed analysis over the vehicle lines and model years that had little
or no claims experience to ensure the vehicle and model substitutions are comparable. We also
involved actuarial specialists to evaluate the methodologies and assumptions, and to test the
actuarial calculations used by the Company.
Sales incentives
Description of the matter Automotive sales and revenue represents the amount of consideration to which the Company
expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or providing services, which is net of dealer
and customer sales incentives the Company expects to pay. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial
statements, provisions for dealer and customer incentives are recorded as a reduction to Automotive
net sales and revenue at the time of vehicle sale. The liabilities for dealer and customer allowances,
claims and discounts amount to $4.8 billion at December 31, 2022.
Auditing the estimate of sales incentives involved a high degree of judgment. Significant factors
used by the Company in estimating its liability for retail incentives include type of program,
forecasted sales volumes, product mix, and the rate of customer acceptance of incentive programs,
all of which are estimated based on historical experience and assumptions concerning future
customer behavior and market conditions. The Company’s estimation model reflects the best
estimate of the total incentive amount that the Company reasonably expects to pay at the time of
sale. The estimated cost of incentives is forward-looking, and could be materially affected by future
economic and market conditions.
How we addressed the matter
in our auditWe evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls over the
Company’s sales incentive process, including management’s review of the estimation model, the
significant assumptions (e.g., incentive cost per unit, customer take rate, and market conditions), and
the data inputs used in the model.
Our audit procedures included, among others, the performance of analytical procedures to develop
an independent range of the liability for retail incentives as of the balance sheet date. Our
independent range was developed for comparison to the Company’s recorded liability, and is based
on historical claims, forecasted spend, and the specific vehicle mix of current dealer stock. In
addition, we performed sensitivity analyses over the cost per unit assumption developed by
management to evaluate the impact on the liability resulting from a change in the assumption.
Lastly, we assessed management’s forecasting process by performing quarterly hindsight analyses to
assess the adequacy of prior forecasts.
Valuation of GM Financial Equipment on Operating Leases
Description of the matter GM Financial has recorded investments in vehicles leased to retail customers under operating
leases. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, at the beginning of the lease, management
establishes an expected residual value for each vehicle at the end of the lease term. The Company’s
estimated residual value of leased vehicles at the end of lease term was $24.7 billion as of December
31, 2022.
50
Table of Contents
Auditing management’s estimate of the residual value of leased vehicles involved a high degree of
judgment. Management’s estimate is based, in part, on third-party data which considers inputs
including recent auction values and significant assumptions regarding the expected future volume of
leased vehicles that will be returned to the Company, used car prices, manufacturer incentive
programs and fuel prices. Realization of the residual values is dependent on the future ability to
market the vehicles under future prevailing market conditions.
How we addressed the matter
in our auditWe evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the Company’s controls over the
lease residual estimation process, including controls over management’s review of residual value
estimates obtained from the Company’s third-party provider and other significant assumptions.
 
Our procedures also included, among others, independently recalculating depreciation related to
equipment on operating leases and performing sensitivity analyses related to significant
assumptions. We also performed hindsight analyses to assess the propriety of management’s
estimate of residual values, as well as tested the completeness and accuracy of data from underlying
systems and data warehouses that are used in the estimation models.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
 
To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of General Motors Company
Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited General Motors Company and subsidiaries’ internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022,
based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, General Motors Company and subsidiaries (the
Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on
the COSO criteria.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)
(PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements
of income, comprehensive income, cash flows and equity for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the
related notes and our report dated January 31, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment
of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal
Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with
respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities
and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects.
Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material
weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to
the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only
in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material
effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because
of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Note 1. Nature of Operations and Basis of Presentation
General Motors Company was incorporated as a Delaware corporation in 2009. We design, build and sell trucks, crossovers, cars
and automobile parts and provide software-enabled services and subscriptions worldwide. Additionally, we are investing in and
growing an AV business. We also provide automotive financing services through GM Financial. We analyze the results of our
operations through the following segments: GMNA, GMI, Cruise and GM Financial. Cruise is our global segment responsible for
the development and commercialization of AV technology. Nonsegment operations are classified as Corporate. Corporate includes
certain centrally recorded income and costs such as interest, income taxes, corporate expenditures and certain nonsegment-specific
revenues and expenses. The consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP. Except for per share
amounts or as otherwise specified, amounts presented within tables are stated in millions. Certain columns and rows may not add
due to rounding.
Principles of Consolidation We consolidate entities that we control due to ownership of a majority voting interest and we
consolidate variable interest entities (VIEs) when we are the primary beneficiary. All intercompany balances and transactions are
eliminated in consolidation. Our share of earnings or losses of nonconsolidated affiliates is included in our consolidated operating
results using the equity method of accounting when we are able to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial
decisions of the affiliate.
Use of Estimates in the Preparation of the Financial Statements Accounting estimates are an integral part of the consolidated
financial statements. These estimates require the use of judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses in the periods presented. We believe that the accounting estimates employed are appropriate and the resulting
balances are reasonable; however, due to the inherent uncertainties in making estimates, actual results could differ from the original
estimates, requiring adjustments to these balances in future periods.
GM Financial The amounts presented for GM Financial are adjusted to reflect the impact on GM Financial's deferred tax positions
and provision for income taxes resulting from the inclusion of GM Financial in our consolidated tax return and to eliminate the
effect of transactions between GM Financial and the other members of the consolidated group. Accordingly, the amounts presented
will differ from those presented by GM Financial on a stand-alone basis.
Note 2. Significant Accounting Policies
The accounting policies that follow are utilized by our automotive, automotive financing and Cruise operations, unless otherwise
indicated.
Revenue Recognition
Automotive Automotive net sales and revenue represents the amount of consideration to which we expect to be entitled in
exchange for vehicle, parts and accessories and services and other sales. The consideration recognized represents the amount
received, typically shortly after the sale to a customer, net of estimated dealer and customer sales incentives we reasonably expect to
pay. Significant factors in determining our estimates of incentives include forecasted sales volume, product mix and the rate of
customer acceptance of incentive programs, all of which are estimated based on historical experience and assumptions concerning
future customer behavior and market conditions. Subsequent adjustments to incentive estimates are possible as facts and
circumstances change over time. A portion of the consideration received is deferred for separate performance obligations, such as
maintenance, services and vehicle connectivity, that will be provided to our customers at a future date. Taxes assessed by various
government entities, such as sales, use and value-added taxes, collected at the time of the vehicle sale are excluded from Automotive
net sales and revenue. Costs for shipping and handling activities that occur after control of the vehicle transfers to the dealer are
recognized at the time of sale and presented in Automotive and other cost of sales.
Vehicle, Parts and Accessories For the majority of vehicle and accessories sales, our customers obtain control and we recognize
revenue when the vehicle transfers to the dealer, which typically occurs either when the vehicle is released to the carrier responsible
for transporting it to a dealer or upon delivery to a dealer. Revenue, net of estimated returns, is recognized on the sale of parts upon
delivery to the customer. When our customers have a right to return eligible parts and accessories, we consider the returns in our
estimation of the transaction price.

GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)
Typically, transfers to daily rental companies are accounted for as sales, with revenue recognized at the time of transfer. We defer
revenue for remarketing obligations, record a residual value guarantee and reflect a liability for amounts expected to be paid once
the remarketing services are complete at the time of sale and recognize deferred revenue in earnings upon completion of the
remarketing service.
Used Vehicles Proceeds from the auction of vehicles utilized by our employees are recognized in Automotive net sales and
revenue upon transfer of control of the vehicle to the customer and the related vehicle carrying value is recognized in Automotive
and other cost of sales.
Services and Other Services and other revenue primarily consists of revenue from vehicle-related service arrangements and after-
sale services such as maintenance, OnStar, Super Cruise, vehicle connectivity and extended service warranties. For those service
arrangements that are bundled with a vehicle sale, a portion of the revenue from the sale is allocated to the service component and
recognized as deferred revenue within Accrued liabilities or Other liabilities. We recognize revenue for bundled services and services
sold separately as services are performed, typically over a period of up to seven years.
Automotive Financing - GM Financial Finance charge income earned on finance receivables is recognized using the effective
interest method. Fees and commissions received (including manufacturer subvention) and direct costs of originating loans are
deferred and amortized over the term of the related finance receivables using the effective interest method and are removed from the
consolidated balance sheets when the related finance receivables are fully charged off or paid in full. Accrual of finance charge
income on retail finance receivables is generally suspended on accounts that are more than 60 days delinquent, accounts in
bankruptcy and accounts in repossession. Payments received on nonaccrual loans are first applied to any fees due, then to any
interest due and then any remaining amounts are applied to principal. Interest accrual generally resumes once an account has
received payments bringing the delinquency to less than 60 days past due. Accrual of finance charge income on commercial finance
receivables is generally suspended on accounts that are more than 90 days delinquent, upon receipt of a bankruptcy notice from a
borrower, or where reasonable doubt exists about the full collectability of contractually agreed upon principal and interest. Payments
received on nonaccrual loans are first applied to principal. Interest accrual resumes once an account has received payments bringing
the account fully current and collection of contractual principal and interest is reasonably assured (including amounts previously
charged off).
Income from operating lease assets, which includes lease origination fees, net of lease origination costs, is recorded as operating
lease revenue on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease agreement. Gains or losses realized upon disposition of off-lease
assets including any payments received from lessees upon lease termination, are included in GM Financial interest, operating and
other expenses.
Advertising and Promotion Expenditures Advertising and promotion expenditures, which are expensed as incurred in Automotive
and other selling, general and administrative expense, were $4.0 billion, $3.3 billion and $2.7 billion in the years ended December
31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.
Research and Development Expenditures Research and development expenditures, which are expensed as incurred in Automotive
and other cost of sales, were $9.8 billion, $7.9 billion and $6.2 billion in the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. We
enter into co-development arrangements with third parties or nonconsolidated affiliates for product-related research, engineering,
design and development activities. Cost sharing payments and fees related to these arrangements are presented in Automotive and
other cost of sales.
Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash Cash equivalents are defined as short-term, highly-liquid investments with original
maturities of 90 days or less. Certain operating agreements require us to post cash as collateral. Cash and cash equivalents subject to
contractual restrictions and not readily available are classified as restricted cash. Restricted cash is invested in accordance with the
terms of the underlying agreements and include amounts related to various deposits, escrows and other cash collateral. Restricted
cash is included in Other current assets and Other assets in the consolidated balance sheets.
Fair Value Measurements A three-level valuation hierarchy, based upon observable and unobservable inputs, is used for fair value
measurements. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect market
assumptions based on the best evidence available. These two types of inputs create the following fair value hierarchy: Level 1 –
Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets; Level 2 – Quoted prices for similar instruments
58
Table of Contents
GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)
in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and model-derived valuations
whose significant inputs are observable; and Level 3 – Instruments whose significant inputs are unobservable.
Marketable Debt Securities We generally classify marketable debt securities as available-for-sale. Various factors, including
turnover of holdings and investment guidelines, are considered in determining the classification of securities. Available-for-sale debt
securities are recorded at fair value with non-credit related unrealized gains and losses recorded in Accumulated other
comprehensive loss until realized. Credit losses are recorded in Interest income and other non-operating income, net. An evaluation
is made quarterly to determine if any portion of unrealized losses recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss needs to be
reclassified. Non-credit related unrealized losses are reclassified to Interest income and other non-operating income, net if we intend
to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before the recovery of the unrealized loss.
We determine realized gains and losses for all debt securities using the specific identification method and measure the fair value of
our marketable debt securities using a market approach where identical or comparable prices are available and an income approach
in other cases. If quoted market prices are not available, fair values of securities are determined using prices from a pricing service,
pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or discounted cash flow models. These prices represent non-
binding quotes. Our pricing service utilizes industry-standard pricing models that consider various inputs. We review our pricing
service quarterly and believe the prices received from our pricing service are a reliable representation of exit prices.
Accounts and Notes Receivable Accounts and notes receivable primarily consists of amounts that are due and payable from our
customers for the sale of vehicles, parts and accessories. We evaluate the collectability of receivables each reporting period and
record an allowance for doubtful accounts to present the net amount expected to be collected on our receivables. Additions to the
allowance are charged to bad debt expense reported in Automotive and other selling, general and administrative expense and were
insignificant in the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.
GM Financial Receivables Finance receivables are carried at amortized cost, net of allowance for loan losses. Provisions for loan
losses are charged to operations in amounts sufficient to maintain the allowance for loan losses at levels considered adequate to
cover expected credit losses on the finance receivables. For retail finance receivables, GM Financial uses static pool modeling
techniques to determine the allowance for loan losses expected over the remaining life of the receivables, which is supplemented by
management judgment. The modeling techniques incorporate reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic conditions over the
expected remaining life of the finance receivables. The economic forecasts incorporate factors which vary by region that GM
Financial believes will have the largest impact on expected losses, including unemployment rates, interest rate spreads, disposable
personal income and growth rates in gross domestic product.
Troubled debt restructurings (TDRs) are grouped separately for purposes of measuring the allowance. The allowance for TDRs
uses static pool modeling techniques like non-TDR retail finance receivables to determine the expected loss amount. The expected
cash flows of the receivables are then discounted at the original weighted average effective interest rate of the pool. Factors
considered when estimating the allowance for TDRs are based on an evaluation of historical and current information, which may be
supplemented by management judgment. Finance charge income from loans classified as TDRs is accounted for in the same manner
as other accruing loans. Cash collections on these loans are allocated according to the same payment hierarchy methodology applied
to loans that are not classified as TDRs.
Commercial finance receivables are carried at amortized cost, net of allowance for loan losses and amounts held under a cash
management program. GM Financial establishes the allowance for loan losses based on historical loss experience, as well as
forecasted auto industry conditions, which is the economic indicator believed to have the largest impact on expected losses.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in
the ordinary course of business less cost to sell, and considers general market and economic conditions, periodic reviews of current
profitability of vehicles, product warranty costs and the effect of estimated sales incentives. Net realizable value for off-lease and
other vehicles is current auction sales proceeds less disposal and warranty costs. Productive material, supplies, work in process and
service parts are reviewed to determine if inventory quantities are in excess of forecasted usage or if they have become obsolete.
Equipment on Operating Leases Equipment on operating leases, net primarily consists of vehicle leases to retail customers with
lease terms of two to five years. We are exposed to changes in the residual values of these assets. The residual values represent
estimates of the values of the leased vehicles at the end of the lease agreements and are determined based on
59
Table of Contents
GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)
forecasted auction proceeds when there is a reliable basis to make such a determination. Realization of the residual values is
dependent on the future ability to market the vehicles under prevailing market conditions. The estimate of the residual value is
evaluated over the life of the arrangement and adjustments may be made to the extent the expected value of the vehicle changes.
Adjustments may be in the form of revisions to the depreciation rate or recognition of an impairment charge. A lease vehicle asset
group is determined to be impaired if an impairment indicator exists and the expected future cash flows, which include estimated
residual values, are lower than the carrying amount of the vehicle asset group. If the carrying amount is considered impaired an
impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds fair value of the vehicle asset group. Fair value
is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows, including estimated residual values. In our automotive finance operations
when a leased vehicle is returned or repossessed the asset is recorded in Other assets at the lower of amortized cost or net realizable
value. Upon disposition a gain or loss is recorded in GM Financial interest, operating and other expenses for any difference between
the net book value of the leased asset and the proceeds from the disposition of the asset.
Equity Investments When events and circumstances warrant, equity investments accounted for under the equity method of
accounting are evaluated for impairment. An impairment charge is recorded whenever a decline in value of an equity investment
below its carrying amount is determined to be other-than-temporary. Impairment charges related to equity method investments are
recorded in Equity income. Equity investments that are not accounted for under the equity method of accounting are measured at fair
value or in certain cases adjusted to fair value upon an observable price change, with changes in fair value recorded in Interest
income and other non-operating income, net.
Property, net Property, plant and equipment, including internal use software, is recorded at cost. Major improvements that extend
the useful life or add functionality are capitalized. The gross amount of assets under finance leases is included in property, plant and
equipment. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred. We depreciate depreciable property using
the straight-line method. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the period of lease or the life of the asset, whichever is shorter.
The amortization of the assets under finance leases is included in depreciation expense. Upon retirement or disposition of property,
plant and equipment, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated and any resulting gain or loss is recorded in
earnings. Impairment charges related to property are recorded in Automotive and other cost of sales, Automotive and other selling,
general and administrative expense or GM Financial interest, operating and other expenses.
Special Tools Special tools represent product-specific propulsion and non-propulsion related tools, dies, molds and other items used
in the vehicle manufacturing process. Expenditures for special tools are recorded at cost and are capitalized. We amortize special
tools over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method or an accelerated amortization method based on their historical
and estimated production volume. Impairment charges related to special tools are recorded in Automotive and other cost of sales.
Goodwill Goodwill is not amortized but rather tested for impairment annually on October 1 and when events warrant such a review.
The impairment test entails an assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that an impairment
exists. If it is more likely than not that an impairment exists, then a quantitative impairment test is performed. Impairment exists
when the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value.
Intangible Assets, net Intangible assets, excluding goodwill, primarily include brand names, technology and intellectual property,
customer relationships and dealer networks. Intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line or an accelerated method of
amortization over their estimated useful lives. Amortization of developed technology and intellectual property is recorded in
Automotive and other cost of sales. Amortization of brand names, customer relationships and our dealer networks is recorded in
Automotive and other selling, general and administrative expense or GM Financial interest, operating and other expenses.
Impairment charges, if any, related to intangible assets are recorded in Automotive and other selling, general and administrative
expense or Automotive and other cost of sales.
Valuation of Long-Lived Assets The carrying amount of long-lived assets and finite-lived intangible assets to be held and used in
the business is evaluated for impairment when events and circumstances warrant. If the carrying amount of a long-lived asset group
is considered impaired, a loss is recorded based on the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds fair value. Product-specific
long-lived asset groups and non-product specific long-lived assets are separately tested for impairment on an asset group basis. Fair
value is determined using either the market or sales comparison approach, cost approach or anticipated cash flows discounted at a
rate commensurate with the risk involved. Long-lived assets to be disposed of other than by sale are considered held for use until
disposition.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)
Government Incentives and Grants We receive incentives from federal, state and local governments in different regions of the
world that primarily encourage us to establish, maintain, or increase investment, employment, or production in the region. We
account for government incentives as a reduction of expense, a reduction of the cost of the capital investment, or other income based
on the substance of the incentive received. Benefits are generally recorded when there is reasonable assurance of receipt and
amounts are recorded in earnings as the expenses in which the incentive is meant to offset are incurred, as we meet the conditions of
the grant or as the capital investment is depreciated. At December 31, 2022, cash incentives receivable in Accounts and notes
receivable, net of allowance was $300 million, cash incentives receivable in Other assets was $248 million and deferred incentive
income in Other liabilities was $250 million. In the year ended December 31, 2022, we recognized $234 million in Automotive and
other cost of sales associated with incentives. Current agreements expire at various dates through 2031 and we consider the risk that
any amounts recognized will be returned to be remote.
Pension and OPEB Plans
Attribution, Methods and Assumptions The cost of benefits provided by defined benefit pension plans is recorded in the period
employees provide service. The cost of pension plan amendments that provide for benefits already earned by plan participants is
amortized over the expected period of benefit which may be the duration of the applicable collective bargaining agreement specific
to the plan, the expected future working lifetime or the life expectancy of the plan participants.
The cost of medical, dental, legal service and life insurance benefits provided through postretirement benefit plans is recorded in
the period employees provide service. The cost of postretirement plan amendments that provide for benefits already earned by plan
participants is amortized over the expected period of benefit which may be the average period to full eligibility or the average life
expectancy of the plan participants.
An expected return on plan asset methodology is utilized to calculate future pension expense for certain significant funded benefit
plans. A market-related value of plan assets methodology is also utilized that averages gains and losses on the plan assets over a
period of years to determine future pension expense. The methodology recognizes 60% of the difference between the fair value of
assets and the expected calculated value in the first year and 10% of that difference over each of the next four years.
The discount rate assumption is established for each of the retirement-related benefit plans at their respective measurement dates.
In the U.S., we use a cash flow matching approach that uses projected cash flows matched to spot rates along a high-quality
corporate bond yield curve to determine the present value of cash flows to calculate a single equivalent discount rate. We apply
individual annual yield curve rates to determine the service cost and interest cost for our pension and OPEB plans to more
specifically link the cash flows related to service cost and interest cost to bonds maturing in their year of payment.
The benefit obligation for pension plans in Canada, the United Kingdom and Germany represents 90% of the non-U.S. pension
benefit obligation at December 31, 2022. The discount rates for plans in Canada, the United Kingdom and Germany are determined
using a cash flow matching approach like the U.S.
Plan Asset Valuation Due to the lack of timely available market information for certain investments in the asset classes described
below as well as the inherent uncertainty of valuation, reported fair values may differ from fair values that would have been used had
timely available market information been available.
Common and Preferred Stock Common and preferred stock for which market prices are readily available at the measurement date
are valued at the last reported sale price or official closing price on the primary market or exchange on which they are actively traded
and are classified in Level 1. Such equity securities for which the market is not considered to be active are valued via the use of
observable inputs, which may include the use of adjusted market prices last available, bids or last available sales prices and/or other
observable inputs and are classified in Level 2. Common and preferred stock classified in Level 3 are privately issued securities or
other issues that are valued via the use of valuation models using significant unobservable inputs that generally consider aged (stale)
pricing, earnings multiples, discounted cash flows and/or other qualitative and quantitative factors.
Debt Securities Valuations for debt securities are based on quotations received from independent pricing services or from dealers
who make markets in such securities. Debt securities priced via pricing services that utilize matrix pricing which considers readily
observable inputs such as the yield or price of bonds of comparable quality, coupon, maturity and type as well
61

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)
as dealer supplied prices, are classified in Level 2. Debt securities that are typically priced by dealers and pricing services via the use
of proprietary pricing models which incorporate significant unobservable inputs are classified in Level 3. These inputs primarily
consist of yield and credit spread assumptions, discount rates, prepayment curves, default assumptions and recovery rates.
Investment Funds, Private Equity and Debt Investments and Real Estate Investments Investment funds, private equity and debt
investments and real estate investments are valued based on the Net Asset Value (NAV) per Share (or its equivalent) as a practical
expedient to estimate fair value due to the absence of readily available market prices.
NAVs are provided by the respective investment sponsors or investment advisers and are subsequently reviewed and approved by
management. In the event management concludes a reported NAV does not reflect fair value or is not determined as of the financial
reporting measurement date, we will consider whether and when deemed necessary to make an adjustment at the balance sheet date.
In determining whether an adjustment to the external valuation is required, we will review material factors that could affect the
valuation, such as changes in the composition or performance of the underlying investments or comparable investments, overall
market conditions, expected sale prices for private investments which are probable of being sold in the short-term and other
economic factors that may possibly have a favorable or unfavorable effect on the reported external valuation.
Stock Incentive Plans Our stock incentive plans include RSUs, PSUs, stock options and awards that may be settled in our stock, the
stock of our subsidiaries or in cash. We measure and record compensation expense based on the fair value of GM or Cruise's
common stock on the date of grant for RSUs and PSUs and the grant date fair value, determined utilizing a lattice model or the
Black-Scholes formula, for stock options and PSUs. We record compensation cost for service-based RSUs, PSUs and service-based
stock options on a straight-line basis over the entire vesting period, or for retirement eligible employees over the requisite service
period. In March 2022, all outstanding RSUs that settle in Cruise's common stock were modified to remove the liquidity vesting
condition. Prospectively, RSUs that will settle in Cruise's common stock will vest solely upon satisfaction of a service condition.
Compensation cost for awards that do not have an established accounting grant date, but for which the service inception date has
been established, or are settled in cash is based on the fair value of GM or Cruise's common stock at the end of each reporting
period. Compensation cost is also recorded on stock issued to settle awards based on the fair value of Cruise's common stock until
such time that the stock has been issued for more than six months.
Product Warranty and Recall Campaigns The estimated costs related to product warranties are accrued at the time products are
sold and are charged to Automotive and other cost of sales. These estimates are established using historical information on the
nature, frequency and average cost of claims of each vehicle line or each model year of the vehicle line and assumptions about future
activity and events. Revisions are made when necessary and are based on changes in these factors.
The estimated costs related to recall campaigns are accrued when probable and estimable. In GMNA, we estimate the costs related
to recall campaigns by applying a paid loss approach that considers the number of historical recall campaigns and the estimated cost
for each recall campaign. The estimated costs associated with recall campaigns in other geographical regions are determined using
the estimated costs of repairs and the estimated number of vehicles to be repaired. Costs associated with recall campaigns are
charged to Automotive and other cost of sales. Revisions are made when necessary based on changes in these factors.
Income Taxes The liability method is used in accounting for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for
temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the consolidated financial
statements using the statutory tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect on deferred
tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax laws or rates is recorded in the results of operations in the period that includes the
enactment date under the law. We record Global Intangible Low Tax Income (GILTI) as a current period expense when incurred.
We establish valuation allowances for deferred tax assets based on a more likely than not standard. Deferred income tax assets are
evaluated quarterly to determine if valuation allowances are required or should be adjusted. The ability to realize deferred tax assets
depends on the ability to generate sufficient taxable income within the carryback or carryforward periods provided for in the tax law
for each applicable tax jurisdiction. The assessment regarding whether a valuation allowance is required or should be adjusted also
considers all available positive and negative evidence factors. It is difficult to conclude a valuation allowance is not required when
there is significant objective and verifiable negative evidence, such as cumulative
62

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)
losses in recent years. We utilize a rolling three years of actual and current year results as the primary measure of cumulative losses
in recent years.
We record uncertain tax positions on the basis of a two-step process whereby we determine whether it is more likely than not that
the tax positions will be sustained based on the technical merits of the position, and for those tax positions that meet the more likely
than not criteria, we recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate
settlement with the related tax authority. We record interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions in Income tax expense.
Foreign Currency Transactions and Translation The assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries that use the local currency as
their functional currency are translated to U.S. Dollars based on the current exchange rate prevailing at each balance sheet date and
any resulting translation adjustments are included in Accumulated other comprehensive loss. The assets and liabilities of foreign
subsidiaries whose local currency is not their functional currency are remeasured from their local currency to their functional
currency and then translated to U.S. Dollars. Revenues and expenses are translated into U.S. Dollars using the average exchange
rates prevailing for each period presented. The financial statements of any foreign subsidiary that has been identified as having a
highly inflationary economy are remeasured as if the functional currency were the U.S. Dollar.
Gains and losses arising from foreign currency transactions and the effects of remeasurements discussed in the preceding
paragraph are recorded in Automotive and other cost of sales and GM Financial interest, operating and other expenses unless related
to Automotive debt, which are recorded in Interest income and other non-operating income, net. Foreign currency transactions and
remeasurements in the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 were $172 million of losses, insignificant gains and $203
million of losses.
Derivative Financial Instruments Derivative financial instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities at fair value. The
accounting for changes in the fair value of each derivative financial instrument depends on whether it has been designated and
qualifies as an accounting hedge, as well as the type of hedging relationship identified. Cash flows for all derivative financial
instruments are typically classified in cash flows from operating activities. Derivative instruments are not used for trading or
speculative purposes.
Automotive We utilize options, swaps and forward contracts to manage foreign currency and commodity price risk. The change in
the fair value of option, swap and forward contracts not designated as an accounting hedge is recorded in Interest income and other
non-operating income, net.
Certain foreign currency and commodity forward contracts have been designated and qualify as cash flow hedges. The risk being
hedged is foreign currency and commodity price risk related to forecasted transactions. The change in the fair value of these forward
contracts is recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss and will be recognized in Automotive net sales and revenue or
Automotive and other cost of sales when the hedged transaction impacts earnings. Forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges
are evaluated for effectiveness using regression analysis at inception and throughout the hedge period.
Automotive Financing - GM Financial GM Financial utilizes interest rate derivative instruments to manage interest rate risk and
foreign currency derivative instruments to manage foreign currency risk. The change in fair value of the derivative instruments not
designated as an accounting hedge is recorded in GM Financial interest, operating and other expenses.
Certain interest rate and foreign currency swap agreements have been designated as fair value hedges. The risk being hedged is the
risk of changes in the fair value of the hedged debt attributable to changes in the benchmark interest rate or the risk of changes in fair
value attributable to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. If the swap has been designated as a fair value hedge, the changes
in the fair value of the hedged item are recorded in GM Financial interest, operating and other expenses. The change in fair value of
the related hedge is also recorded in GM Financial interest, operating and other expenses.
Certain interest rate swap and foreign currency swap agreements have been designated as cash flow hedges. The risk being hedged
is the interest rate and foreign currency risk related to forecasted transactions. If the contract has been designated as a cash flow
hedge, the change in the fair value of the cash flow hedge is deferred in Accumulated other comprehensive loss and is recognized in
GM Financial interest, operating and other expenses along with the earnings effect of the hedged item when the hedged item affects
earnings. Changes in the fair value of amounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recorded currently in earnings and
are presented in the same income statement line as the earnings effect of the hedged item.

Recently Adopted Accounting Standards Effective October 1, 2022, we adopted Accounting Standard Update (ASU) 2022-03,
"Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions" (ASU
2022-03), which clarifies that a contractual restriction on the sale of an equity security is not considered in measuring fair value. The
adoption of ASU 2022-03 was insignificant to our consolidated financial statements.
Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted In March 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU 2022-02
"Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures" (ASU 2022-02), which
eliminates the accounting guidance for TDRs and enhances certain disclosure requirements. We adopted ASU 2022-02 on a modified
retrospective basis on January 1, 2023. The impact of the adoption of ASU 2022-02 was insignificant.

GM Financial reviews the ongoing credit quality of retail finance receivables based on customer payment activity. A retail account
is considered delinquent if a substantial portion of a scheduled payment has not been received by the date the payment was
contractually due. Retail finance receivables are collateralized by vehicle titles and, subject to local laws, GM Financial generally
has the right to repossess the vehicle in the event the customer defaults on the payment terms of the contract. The accrual of finance
charge income had been suspended on delinquent retail finance receivables with contractual amounts due of $685 million and $602
million at December 31, 2022 and 2021. The following tables are consolidated summaries of the delinquency status of the

Commercial Finance Receivables GM Financial's commercial finance receivables consist of dealer financings, primarily for
dealer inventory purchases. Proprietary models are used to assign a risk rating to each dealer. GM Financial performs periodic credit
reviews of each dealership and adjusts the dealership's risk rating, if necessary. There were no commercial finance receivables on
nonaccrual status at December 31, 2022 and 2021.
GM Financial's commercial risk model and risk rating categories are as follows:
Rating Description
IPerforming accounts with strong to acceptable financial metrics with at least satisfactory capacity to meet financial
commitments.
IIPerforming accounts experiencing potential weakness in financial metrics and repayment prospects resulting in
increased monitoring.
IIINon-Performing accounts with inadequate paying capacity for current obligations and have the distinct possibility of
creating a loss if deficiencies are not corrected.
IVNon-Performing accounts with inadequate paying capacity for current obligations and inherent weaknesses that make
collection of liquidation in full highly questionable or improbable.
Dealers with III and IV risk ratings are subject to additional monitoring and restrictions on funding, including suspension of lines
of credit and liquidation of assets. The following tables summarize the credit risk profile by dealer risk rating of commercial finance
receivables at December 31, 2022 and 2021:

Note 11. Variable Interest Entities
Consolidated VIEs
Automotive Financing - GM Financial
GM Financial uses special purpose entities (SPEs) that are considered VIEs to issue variable funding notes to third party bank-
sponsored warehouse facilities or asset-backed securities to investors in securitization transactions. The debt issued by these VIEs is
backed by finance receivables and leasing-related assets transferred to the VIEs (Securitized Assets). GM Financial determined that
it is the primary beneficiary of the SPEs because the servicing responsibilities for the Securitized Assets give GM Financial the
power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the performance of the VIEs and the variable interests in the VIEs give
GM Financial the obligation to absorb losses and the right to receive residual returns that could potentially be significant. The assets
of the VIEs serve as the sole source of repayment for the debt issued by these entities. Investors in the notes issued by the VIEs do
not have recourse to GM Financial or its other assets, with the exception of customary representation and warranty repurchase
provisions and indemnities that GM Financial provides as the servicer. GM Financial is not required to provide additional financial
support to these SPEs. While these subsidiaries are included in GM Financial's consolidated financial statements, they are separate
legal entities and their assets are legally owned by them and are not available to GM Financial's creditors or creditors of GM
Financial's other subsidiaries.
The following table summarizes the assets and liabilities related to GM Financial's consolidated VIEs:
December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021
Restricted cash – current $ 2,176 $ 2,291 
Restricted cash – non-current $ 360 $ 449 
GM Financial receivables, net of fees – current $ 19,896 $ 15,344 
GM Financial receivables, net of fees – non-current $ 18,748 $ 16,518 
GM Financial equipment on operating leases, net $ 18,456 $ 16,143 
GM Financial short-term debt and current portion of long-term debt $ 21,643 $ 19,876 
GM Financial long-term debt $ 20,545 $ 19,401 
GM Financial recognizes finance charge, leased vehicle and fee income on the Securitized Assets and interest expense on the
secured debt issued in a securitization transaction and records a provision for loan losses to recognize loan losses expected over the
remaining life of the finance receivables.
Nonconsolidated VIEs
Automotive
Nonconsolidated VIEs principally include automotive related operating entities to which we provided financial support to ensure
that our supply needs for production are met or are not disrupted. Our variable interests in these nonconsolidated VIEs include
equity investments, accounts and loans receivable, committed financial support and other off-balance sheet

Compliance with Debt Covenants Several of our loan facilities, including our revolving credit facilities, require compliance with
certain financial and operational covenants as well as regular reporting to lenders, including providing certain subsidiary financial
statements. Certain of GM Financial’s secured debt agreements also contain various covenants, including maintaining portfolio
performance ratios as well as limits on deferment levels. GM Financial’s unsecured debt obligations contain covenants including
limitations on GM Financial's ability to incur certain liens. Failure to meet certain of these requirements may result in a covenant
violation or an event of default depending on the terms of the agreement. An event of default may allow lenders to declare amounts
outstanding under these agreements immediately due and payable, to enforce their interests against collateral pledged under these
agreements or restrict our ability or GM Financial's ability to obtain additional borrowings. No technical defaults or covenant
violations existed at December 31, 2022.

Note 15. Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits
Employee Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans
Defined Benefit Pension Plans Defined benefit pension plans covering eligible U.S. hourly employees (hired prior to October
2007) and Canadian hourly employees (hired prior to October 2016) generally provide benefits of negotiated, stated amounts for
each year of service and supplemental benefits for employees who retire with 30 years of service before normal retirement age. The
benefits provided by the defined benefit pension plans covering eligible U.S. (hired prior to January 1, 2001) and Canadian salaried
employees and employees in certain other non-U.S. locations are generally based on years of
78

GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)
service and compensation history. Accrual of defined pension benefits ceased in 2012 for U.S. and Canadian salaried employees.
There is also an unfunded nonqualified pension plan primarily covering U.S. executives for service prior to January 1, 2007 and it is
based on an “excess plan” for service after that date.
The funding policy for qualified defined benefit pension plans is to contribute annually not less than the minimum required by
applicable laws and regulations or to directly pay benefit payments where appropriate. In the year ended December 31, 2022 all legal
funding requirements were met. The following table summarizes contributions made to the defined benefit pension plans:
Years Ended December 31,
2022 2021 2020
U.S. hourly and salaried $ 71 $ 67 $ 68 
Non-U.S. 332 371 396 
Total $ 403 $ 438 $ 464 
We expect to contribute approximately $60 million to our U.S. non-qualified plans and approximately $600 million to our non-
U.S. pension plans in 2023.
Based on our current assumptions, over the next five years, we expect no significant mandatory contributions to our U.S. qualified
pension plans and mandatory contributions totaling $269 million to our United Kingdom and Canada pension plans.
Other Postretirement Benefit Plans Certain hourly and salaried defined benefit plans provide postretirement medical, dental,
legal service and life insurance to eligible U.S. and Canadian retirees and their eligible dependents. Certain other non-U.S.
subsidiaries have postretirement benefit plans, although most non-U.S. employees are covered by government sponsored or
administered programs. We made contributions to the U.S. OPEB plans of $335 million, $351 million and $343 million in the years
ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. Plan participants' contributions were insignificant in the years ended December 31, 2022,
2021 and 2020.
Defined Contribution Plans We have defined contribution plans for eligible U.S. salaried and hourly employees that provide
discretionary matching contributions. Contributions are also made to certain non-U.S. defined contribution plans. We made
contributions to our defined contribution plans of $724 million, $606 million and $573 million in the years ended December 31,
2022, 2021 and 2020.
Significant Plan Amendments, Benefit Modifications and Related Events
Other Remeasurements The SOA issued mortality improvement tables in the three months ended December 31, 2022 and
December 31, 2021. We reviewed our recent mortality experience and we determined our current mortality assumptions are
appropriate to measure our U.S. pension and OPEB plans obligations as of December 31, 2022. In 2020, we incorporated the SOA
mortality improvement tables into our December 31, 2020 measurement of U.S. pension and OPEB plans' benefit obligations. The
change in these assumptions decreased U.S. pension and OPEB plans’ obligations by $686 million as of December 31, 2020.

Assumptions
Investment Strategies and Long-Term Rate of Return Detailed periodic studies are conducted by our internal asset management
group as well as outside actuaries and are used to determine the long-term strategic mix among asset classes, risk mitigation
strategies and the expected long-term return on asset assumptions for the U.S. pension plans. The U.S. study includes a review of
alternative asset allocation and risk mitigation strategies, anticipated future long-term performance and risk of the individual asset
classes that comprise the plans' asset mix. Similar studies are performed for the significant non-U.S. pension plans with the
assistance of outside actuaries and asset managers. While the studies incorporate data from recent plan performance and historical
returns, the expected rate of return on plan assets represents our estimate of long-term prospective rates of return.
We continue to pursue various options to fund and de-risk our pension plans, including continued changes to the pension asset
portfolio mix to reduce funded status volatility. The strategic asset mix and risk mitigation strategies for the plans are tailored
specifically for each plan. Individual plans have distinct liabilities, liquidity needs and regulatory requirements. Consequently, there
are different investment policies set by individual plan fiduciaries. Although investment policies and risk mitigation strategies may
differ among plans, each investment strategy is considered to be appropriate in the context of the specific factors affecting each plan.
In setting new strategic asset mixes, consideration is given to the likelihood that the selected asset mixes will effectively fund the
projected pension plan liabilities, while aligning with the risk tolerance of the plans' fiduciaries. The strategic asset mixes for U.S.
defined benefit pension plans are increasingly designed to satisfy the competing objectives of improving funded positions (market
value of assets equal to or greater than the present value of the liabilities) and mitigating the possibility of a deterioration in funded
status.
Derivatives may be used to provide cost effective solutions for rebalancing investment portfolios, increasing or decreasing
exposure to various asset classes and for mitigating risks, primarily interest rate, equity and currency risks. Equity and fixed income
managers are permitted to utilize derivatives as efficient substitutes for traditional securities. Interest rate derivatives may be used to
adjust portfolio duration to align with a plan's targeted investment policy and equity derivatives may be used to protect equity
positions from downside market losses. Alternative investment managers are permitted to employ leverage, including through the
use of derivatives, which may alter economic exposure.
In December 2022, an investment policy study was completed for the U.S. pension plans. As a result of changes to our capital
market assumptions, the weighted-average long-term rate of return on assets increased from 5.4% at December 31, 2021 to 6.3% at
December 31, 2022. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets used in determining pension expense for non-U.S. plans is
determined in a similar manner to the U.S. plans.
Target Allocation Percentages The following table summarizes the target allocations by asset category for U.S. and non-U.S.

Investment Fund Strategies Investment funds include hedge funds, funds of hedge funds, equity funds and fixed income funds.
Hedge funds and funds of hedge funds managers typically seek to achieve their objectives by allocating capital across a broad array
of funds and/or investment managers. Equity funds invest in U.S. common and preferred stocks as well as similar equity securities
issued by companies incorporated, listed or domiciled in developed and/or emerging market countries. Fixed income funds include
investments in high quality funds and, to a lesser extent, high yield funds. High quality fixed income
83
Table of Contents
GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)
funds invest in government securities, investment-grade corporate bonds and mortgage and asset-backed securities. High yield fixed
income funds invest in high yield fixed income securities issued by corporations, which are rated below investment grade. Other
investment funds also included in this category primarily represent multi-strategy funds that invest in broadly diversified portfolios
of equity, fixed income and derivative instruments.
Private equity and debt investments primarily consist of investments in private equity and debt funds. These investments provide
exposure to and benefit from long-term equity investments in private companies, including leveraged buy-outs, venture capital and
distressed debt strategies.
Real estate investments include funds that invest in entities that are primarily engaged in the ownership, acquisition, development,
financing, sale and/or management of income-producing real estate properties, both commercial and residential. These funds
typically seek long-term growth of capital and current income that is above average relative to public equity funds.
Significant Concentrations of Risk The assets of the pension plans include certain investment funds, private equity and debt
investments and real estate investments. Investment managers may be unable to quickly sell or redeem some or all of these
investments at an amount close or equal to fair value in order to meet a plan's liquidity requirements or to respond to specific events
such as deterioration in the creditworthiness of any particular issuer or counterparty.
Illiquid investments held by the plans are generally long-term investments that complement the long-term nature of pension
obligations and are not used to fund benefit payments when currently due. Plan management monitors liquidity risk on an ongoing
basis and has procedures in place that are designed to maintain flexibility in addressing plan-specific, broader industry and market
liquidity events.
The pension plans may invest in financial instruments denominated in foreign currencies and may be exposed to risks that the
foreign currency exchange rates might change in a manner that has an adverse effect on the value of the foreign currency
denominated assets or liabilities. Forward currency contracts may be used to manage and mitigate foreign currency risk.
The pension plans may invest in debt securities for which any change in the relevant interest rates for particular securities might
result in an investment manager being unable to secure similar returns upon the maturity or the sale of securities. In addition,
changes to prevailing interest rates or changes in expectations of future interest rates might result in an increase or decrease in the
fair value of the securities held. Interest rate swaps and other financial derivative instruments may be used to manage interest rate
risk.
Benefit Payments Benefits for most U.S. pension plans and certain non-U.S. pension plans are paid out of plan assets rather than
our Cash and cash equivalents. The following table summarizes net benefit payments expected to be paid in the future, which
include assumptions related to estimated future employee service:

Note 16. Commitments and Contingencies
Litigation-Related Liability and Tax Administrative Matters In the normal course of our business, we are named from time to
time as a defendant in various legal actions, including arbitrations, class actions and other litigation. We identify below the material
individual proceedings and investigations where we believe a material loss is reasonably possible or probable. We accrue for matters
when we believe that losses are probable and can be reasonably estimated. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had accruals of $1.1
billion and $1.4 billion in Accrued liabilities and Other liabilities. In many matters, it is inherently difficult to determine whether loss
is probable or reasonably possible or to estimate the size or range of the possible loss.
84
Table of Contents
GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)
Accordingly, while we believe that appropriate accruals have been established for losses that are probable and can be reasonably
estimated, it is possible that adverse outcomes from such proceedings could exceed the amounts accrued by an amount that could be
material to our results of operations or cash flows in any particular reporting period.
GM Korea Wage Litigation GM Korea Company (GM Korea) is party to litigation with current and former subcontract workers
over allegations that they are entitled to the same wages and benefits provided to full-time employees, and to be hired as full-time
employees. In May 2018 and September 2020, the Korean labor authorities issued adverse administrative orders finding that GM
Korea must hire certain current subcontract workers as full-time employees. GM Korea appealed the May 2018 and September 2020
orders. In June 2020, the Seoul High Court (an intermediate-level appellate court) ruled against GM Korea in one of the subcontract
worker claims. Although GM Korea has appealed this decision to the Korea Supreme Court, GM Korea has since hired certain of its
subcontract workers as full-time employees. At December 31, 2022, our accrual covering certain asserted claims and claims that we
believe are probable of assertion and for which liability is probable was approximately $282 million. We estimate the reasonably
possible loss in excess of amounts accrued for other current subcontract workers who may assert similar claims to be approximately
$97 million at December 31, 2022. We are currently unable to estimate any reasonably possible material loss or range of loss that
may result from additional claims that may be asserted by former subcontract workers.
Other Litigation-Related Liability and Tax Administrative Matters Various other legal actions, including class actions,
governmental investigations, claims and proceedings, are pending against us or our related companies or joint ventures, including,
but not limited to, matters arising out of alleged product defects; employment-related matters; product and workplace safety, vehicle
emissions and fuel economy regulations; product warranties; financial services; dealer, supplier and other contractual relationships;
government regulations relating to competition issues; tax-related matters not subject to the provision of Accounting Standards
Codification 740, Income Taxes (indirect tax-related matters); product design, manufacture and performance; consumer protection
laws; and environmental protection laws, including laws regulating air emissions, water discharges, waste management and
environmental remediation from stationary sources. We also from time to time receive subpoenas and other inquiries or requests for
information from agencies or other representatives of U.S. federal, state and foreign governments on a variety of issues.
There are several putative class actions pending against GM in federal courts in the U.S. and in the Provincial Courts in Canada
alleging that various vehicles sold, including model year 2011–2016 Duramax Diesel Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra vehicles,
violate federal, state and foreign emission standards. We are currently unable to estimate any reasonably possible material loss or
range of loss that may result from these actions. GM has also faced a series of additional lawsuits in the U.S. based on these
allegations, including a shareholder demand lawsuit that remains pending.
There are several putative class actions and one certified class action pending against GM in federal courts in the U.S. alleging
that various 2011–2014 model year vehicles are defective because they excessively consume oil. While many of these proceedings
have been dismissed or have been settled for insignificant amounts, several remain outstanding, and in October 2022, we received an
adverse jury verdict in a certified class action proceeding involving three states. We do not believe that the verdict is supported by
the evidence and have filed post-trial motions and, if necessary, will appeal. We are currently unable to estimate any reasonably
possible material loss or range of loss that may result from the putative class action proceedings and have previously accrued an
immaterial amount related to the certified class action proceeding.
Beyond the class action litigations disclosed, we have several other class action litigations pending at any given time. Historically,
relatively few classes have been certified in these types of cases. Therefore, we will generally only disclose specific class actions if a
class is certified and we believe there is a reasonably possible material exposure to the Company.
Indirect tax-related matters are being litigated globally pertaining to value added taxes, customs, duties, sales taxes and other non-
income tax-related tax exposures. The various non-U.S. labor-related matters include claims from current and former employees
related to alleged unpaid wage, benefit, severance and other compensation matters. Certain administrative proceedings are indirect
tax-related and may require that we deposit funds in escrow or provide an alternative form of security. Some of the matters may
involve compensatory, punitive or other treble damage claims, environmental remediation programs or sanctions or environmental
compliance requirements and claims that, if granted, could require us to pay damages or make other expenditures in amounts that
could not be reasonably estimated at December 31, 2022. For indirect tax-related matters we estimate our reasonably possible loss in
excess of amounts accrued to be up to approximately $900 million at December 31, 2022.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)
Takata Matters In November 2020, NHTSA directed that we replace the Takata Corporation (Takata) airbag inflators in our
GMT900 vehicles, which are full-size pickup trucks and SUVs, and we decided not to contest NHTSA's decision. While we have
already begun the process of executing the recall, given the number of vehicles in this population, the recall will take several years to
be completed. Accordingly, in the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded a warranty accrual of $1.1 billion for the expected
costs of complying with the recall remedy, and we believe the currently accrued amount remains reasonable.
GM has recalled certain vehicles sold outside of the U.S. to replace Takata inflators in those vehicles. There are significant
differences in vehicle and inflator design between the relevant vehicles sold internationally and those sold in the U.S. We continue to
gather and analyze evidence about these inflators and to share our findings with regulators. Any additional recalls relating to these
inflators could be material to our results of operations and cash flows.
There are several putative class actions that have been filed against GM, including in the federal courts in the U.S., in the
Provincial Courts in Canada and in Mexico, arising out of allegations that airbag inflators manufactured by Takata are defective. At
this stage of these proceedings, we are unable to provide an estimate of the amounts or range of reasonably possible material loss.
Chevrolet Bolt Recall In July 2021, we initiated a voluntary recall for certain 2017–2019 model year Chevrolet Bolt EVs due to the
risk that two manufacturing defects present in the same battery cell could cause a high voltage battery fire in certain of these
vehicles. Accordingly, in the three months ended June 30, 2021, we recorded a warranty accrual of $812 million. After further
investigation into the manufacturing processes at our battery supplier, LG, and disassembling battery packs, we determined that the
risk of battery cell defects was not confined to the initial recall population. As a result, in August 2021, we expanded the recall to
include all 2017-2022 model year Chevrolet Bolt EV and Chevrolet Bolt Electric Utility Vehicles (EUVs) and recorded an additional
warranty accrual of $1.2 billion in the three months ended September 30, 2021. In October 2021, we reached an agreement with LG,
under which LG will reimburse GM for costs and expenses associated with the recall. As a result, in the three months ended
September 30, 2021, we recognized a receivable of $1.9 billion, which substantially offsets the warranty charges we recognized in
connection with the recall. These charges reflect our current best estimate for the cost of the recall remedy. The actual costs of the
recall and GM's associated recovery from LG could be materially higher or lower. For 2017-2019 model year vehicles, the recall
remedy will be to replace the high voltage battery modules in these vehicles with new modules. For 2020-2022 model year vehicles,
the recall remedy will be to replace any defective high voltage battery modules in these vehicles with new modules.
In addition, putative class actions have been filed against GM in federal courts in the U.S. and in the Provincial Courts in Canada
alleging that the batteries contained in the Bolt EVs and EUVs included in the recall population are defective. At this stage of these
proceedings, we are unable to provide an estimate of the amounts or range of reasonably possible material loss.
Opel/Vauxhall Sale In 2017, we sold the Opel/Vauxhall Business to PSA Group (now Stellantis) under a Master Agreement (the
Agreement). We also sold the European financing subsidiaries and branches to Banque PSA Finance S.A. and BNP Paribas Personal
Finance S.A. Although the sale reduced our new vehicle presence in Europe, we may still be impacted by actions taken by regulators
related to vehicles sold before the sale. Our wholly owned subsidiary (the Seller) agreed to indemnify Stellantis for certain losses
resulting from any inaccuracy of the representations and warranties or breaches of our covenants included in the Agreement and for
certain other liabilities, including costs related to certain emissions claims, product liabilities and recalls. The Company entered into
a guarantee for the benefit of Stellantis, pursuant to which the Company agreed to guarantee the Seller's obligation to indemnify
Stellantis. We are unable to estimate any reasonably possible material loss or range of loss that may result from these actions either
directly or through an indemnification claim from Stellantis. Certain of these indemnification obligations are subject to time
limitations, thresholds and/or caps as to the amount of required payments.
Currently, various consumer lawsuits have been filed against the Seller and Stellantis in Germany, the United Kingdom and the
Netherlands alleging that Opel and Vauxhall vehicles sold by the Seller violated applicable emissions standards. In addition, in the
year ended December 31, 2022, we agreed to indemnify Stellantis for an immaterial amount for certain recalls that Stellantis has
conducted or will conduct, including recalls in certain geographic locations that Stellantis intends to conduct related to Takata
inflators in legacy Opel vehicles. We may in the future be required to further indemnify Stellantis relating to its Takata recalls, but
we believe such further indemnification to be remote at this time.
Product Liability We recorded liabilities of $561 million and $587 million in Accrued liabilities and Other liabilities at December
31, 2022 and 2021, for the expected cost of all known product liability claims, plus an estimate of the expected cost
86

GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)
for product liability claims that have already been incurred and are expected to be filed in the future for which we are self-insured. It
is reasonably possible that our accruals for product liability claims may increase in future periods in material amounts, although we
cannot estimate a reasonable range of incremental loss based on currently available information. We believe that any judgment
against us involving our products for actual damages will be adequately covered by our recorded accruals and, where applicable,
excess liability insurance coverage.
Guarantees We enter into indemnification agreements for liability claims involving products manufactured primarily by certain
joint ventures. These guarantees terminate in years ranging from 2023 to 2027 or upon the occurrence of specific events or are
ongoing. We believe that the related potential costs incurred are adequately covered by our recorded accruals, which are
insignificant. The maximum future undiscounted payments mainly based on royalties received associated with vehicles sold to date
were $3.1 billion for these guarantees at December 31, 2022 and 2021, the majority of which relates to the indemnification
agreements.
We provide payment guarantees on commercial loans outstanding with third parties such as dealers. In some instances, certain
assets of the party or our payables to the party whose debt or performance we have guaranteed may offset, to some degree, the
amount of any potential future payments. We are also exposed to residual value guarantees associated with certain sales to rental car
companies.
We periodically enter into agreements that incorporate indemnification provisions in the normal course of business. It is not
possible to estimate our maximum exposure under these indemnifications or guarantees due to the conditional nature of these
obligations. Insignificant amounts have been recorded for such obligations as the majority of them are not probable or estimable at
this time and the fair value of the guarantees at issuance was insignificant. Refer to the Opel/Vauxhall Sale section of this note for
additional information on our indemnification obligations to Stellantis under the Agreement.
Credit Cards Credit card programs offer rebates that can be applied primarily against the purchase or lease of our vehicles. At
December 31, 2022 and 2021, our redemption liability was insignificant, our deferred revenue was $353 million and $309 million,
and qualified cardholders had rebates available, net of deferred program revenue, of $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion. Our redemption
liability and deferred revenue are recorded in Accrued liabilities and Other liabilities.

$288 million will expire by 2040, if not utilized. At December 31, 2022, U.S. tax credit carryforwards were $5.4 billion, where $292 millio n
can be carried forward indefinitely and $ 5.2 billion will expire by 2042, if not utilized.
(b)    At Dece mber 31, 2022, Non-U.S. operating loss deferred tax assets were $6.1 billion, where $5.1 billion can be carried forward indefinitely
and $1.1 billion will expire by 2042, if not utilized. At December 31, 2022, Non-U.S. tax credit carryforwards were $148 million, where
$112 million can be carried forward indefinitely and $ 36 million will expire by 2042, if not utilized.
Valuation Allowances During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, valuation allowances against deferred tax assets of
$7.7 billion and $8.9 billion were comprised of cumulative losses, credits and other timing differences, primarily in Germany, Spain,
South Korea, the U.S. and Brazil.
In the year ended December 31, 2022, GM entered into a Share Purchase Agreement with SoftBank, pursuant to which GM
acquired SoftBank’s equity ownership stake in Cruise Holdings and, separately, made an additional $1.35 billion investment in
Cruise in place of SoftBank. As of March 31, 2022, GM’s ownership in Cruise increased above the 80% threshold which allowed for
inclusion of Cruise in our U.S. Federal consolidated income tax return and the release of a valuation allowance of $482 million
against certain Cruise deferred tax assets. Refer to Note 20 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information
regarding the Share Purchase Agreement with SoftBank.

Balance at end of period $ 520 $ 634 $ 1,086 
At December 31, 2022 and 2021, there were $356 million and $411 million of unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would
favorably affect our effective tax rate in the future. In the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, income tax related
interest and penalties were insignificant. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had liabilities of $86 million for income tax related
interest and penalties.
At December 31, 2022, it is not possible to reasonably estimate the expected change to the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next twelve months.
Other Matters Income tax returns are filed in multiple jurisdictions and are subject to examination by taxing authorities throughout
the world. We have open tax years from 2011 to 2022 with various significant tax jurisdictions. Tax authorities may have the ability
to review and adjust net operating loss or tax credit carryforwards that were generated prior to these periods if utilized in an open tax
year. These open years contain matters that could be subject to differing interpretations of applicable tax laws and regulations as they
relate to the amount, character, timing or inclusion of revenue and expenses or the sustainability of income tax credits for a given
audit cycle.
Note 18. Restructuring and Other Initiatives
We have executed various restructuring and other initiatives and we may execute additional initiatives in the future, if necessary,
to streamline manufacturing capacity and reduce other costs to improve the utilization of remaining facilities. To the extent these
programs involve voluntary separations, a liability is generally recorded at the time offers to employees are accepted. To the extent
these programs provide separation benefits in accordance with pre-existing agreements, a liability is recorded once the amount is
probable and reasonably estimable. If employees are involuntarily terminated, a liability is generally recorded at the communication
date. Related charges are recorded in Automotive and other cost of sales and Automotive and other selling, general and
administrative expense.
The following table summarizes the reserves and charges related to restructuring and other initiatives, including postemployment
benefit reserves and charges:

recorded a $236 million charge to Income tax expense due to the establishment of a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets
in Australia and New Zealand in the year ended December 31, 2020. We incurred $197 million in net cash outflows in the year
ended December 31, 2020 and $254 million in net cash outflows since program inception resulting from these restructuring actions
primarily for dealer restructuring payments and employee separation payments, which includes proceeds of $143 million from the

Note 20. Stockholders’ Equity and Noncontrolling Interests
Preferred and Common Stock We have 2.0 billion shares of preferred stock and 5.0 billion shares of common stock authorized
for issuance. We had no shares of preferred stock issued and outstanding at December 31, 2022 and 2021. We had 1.4 billion and 1.5
billion shares of common stock issued and outstanding at December 31, 2022 and 2021.
Common Stock Holders of our common stock are entitled to dividends at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors. Our
dividends declared per common share were $0.18 and $0.38 and our total dividends paid on common stock were $257 million and
$545 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2020. Dividends were not declared or paid on our common stock for the
year ended December 31, 2021. Holders of common stock are entitled to one vote per share on all matters submitted to our
stockholders for a vote. The liquidation rights of holders of our common stock are secondary to the payment or provision for
payment of all our debts and liabilities and to holders of our preferred stock, if any such shares are then outstanding.
In August 2022, our Board of Directors increased the capacity under our previously announced common stock repurchase program
to $5.0 billion from the $3.3 billion that remained under the program as of June 30, 2022. In the year ended December 31, 2022, we
purchased approximately 64 million shares of our outstanding common stock for $2.5 billion as part of the program. We did not
purchase any shares of our outstanding common stock in the year ended December 31, 2021. We purchased approximately three
million shares of our outstanding common stock for $90 million in the year ended December 31, 2020.
Cruise Preferred Shares In 2021, Cruise Holdings issued $2.7 billion of Class G Preferred Shares (Cruise Class G Preferred
Shares) to Microsoft Corporation (Microsoft), Walmart Inc. (Walmart) and other investors, including $1.0 billion to General Motors
Holdings LLC. All proceeds related to the Cruise Class G Preferred Shares are designated exclusively for working capital and

The Cruise Class G Preferred Shares participate pari passu with holders of Cruise Holdings common stock and Class F Preferred
Shares (Cruise Class F Preferred Shares) in any dividends declared. The Cruise Class G and Cruise Class F Preferred Shares convert
into the class of shares to be issued to the public in an initial public offering (IPO) at specified exchange ratios. No covenants or
other events of default exist that can trigger redemption of the Cruise Class G and Cruise Class F Preferred Shares. The Cruise Class
G and Cruise Class F Preferred Shares are entitled to receive the greater of their carrying value or a pro-rata share of any proceeds or
distributions upon the occurrence of a merger, sale, liquidation or dissolution of Cruise Holdings, and are classified as
noncontrolling interests in our consolidated financial statements.
In March 2022, under the Share Purchase Agreement, we acquired SoftBank’s Cruise Class A-1, Class F and Class G Preferred
Shares for $2.1 billion and made an additional $1.35 billion investment in Cruise in place of SoftBank. SoftBank no longer has an
ownership interest in or has any rights with respect to Cruise.
Cruise Common Shares During the year ended December 31, 2022, Cruise Holdings issued approximately $0.8 billion of Class B
Common Shares to net settle vested awards under Cruise's 2018 Employee Incentive Plan and issued approximately $0.5 billion of
Class B Common Shares, primarily to us, to fund the payment of statutory tax withholding obligations resulting from the settlement
or exercise of vested awards. Also, GM conducted quarterly tender offers and paid approximately $0.6 billion in cash to purchase
tendered Cruise Class B Common Shares during the year ended December 31, 2022. The Class B Common Shares are classified as
noncontrolling interests in our consolidated financial statements except for certain shares that are liability classified that have a
recorded value of approximately $60 million at December 31, 2022. Refer to Note 22 for additional information on Cruise stock
incentive awards.
During the year ended December 31, 2022, the effect on the equity attributable to us for changes in our ownership interest in
Cruise was insignificant. For the year ended December 31, 2022, net income attributable to shareholders and transfers to the
noncontrolling interest in Cruise and other subsidiaries was $9.2 billion, which included a $0.7 billion decrease in equity attributable
to us, mainly due to the redemption of Cruise preferred shares.
GM Financial Preferred Stock In 2020, GM Financial issued $500 million of Fixed-Rate Reset Cumulative Perpetual Preferred
Stock, Series C, $0.01 par value, with a liquidation preference of $1,000 per share. Dividends will be paid semi-annually when
declared, which started March 30, 2021 at a fixed rate of 5.70%. The preferred stock is classified as noncontrolling interests in our
consolidated financial statements.

Note 22. Stock Incentive Plans
GM Stock Incentive Awards We grant to certain employees RSUs, Restricted Stock Awards (RSAs), PSUs and stock options
(collectively, stock incentive awards) under our 2016 Equity Incentive Plan and 2020 LTIP and prior to the 2020 LTIP, under our
2017 and 2014 LTIP. The 2020 LTIP was approved by stockholders in June 2020. Any new awards granted after the approval of the
2020 LTIP in June 2020 will be issued under the 2020 LTIP. To the extent any shares remain available for issuance under the 2017
LTIP, the 2016 Equity Incentive Plan, and/or the 2014 LTIP, such shares will only be used to settle outstanding awards that were
previously granted under such plans prior to June 2020. Shares awarded under the plans are subject to forfeiture if the participant
leaves the company for reasons other than those permitted under the plans such as retirement, death or disability.
RSU awards granted either cliff vest or ratably vest generally over a three-year service period, as defined in the terms of each
award. PSU awards vest at the end of a three-year performance period, based on performance criteria determined by the Executive
Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors at the time of award. The number of shares earned may equal, exceed or be less
than the targeted number of shares depending on whether the performance criteria are met, surpassed or not met. Stock options
expire 10 years from the grant date. Our performance-based stock options vest ratably over 55 months based on the performance of
our common stock relative to that of a specified peer group. Our service-based stock options vest ratably over three years.
In connection with our acquisition of Cruise Automation, Inc. in May 2016, RSAs and PSUs in common shares of GM were
granted to employees of Cruise Holdings. The RSAs vest ratably, generally over a three-year service period. The PSUs are
contingent upon achievement of specific technology and commercialization milestones.

Our weighted-average assumptions used to value our stock options are a dividend yield of 1.60%, 1.67% and 4.25%, expected
volatility of 41.0%, 47.8% and 26.2%, a risk-free interest rate of 1.88%, 0.76% and 1.44%, and an expected option life of 6.00, 6.00
and 5.97 years for options issued during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. The expected volatility is based on the
average of the implied volatility of publicly traded options for our common stock.
Total compensation expense related to the above awards was $419 million, $391 million and $351 million in the years ended
December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.
At December 31, 2022, the total unrecognized compensation expense for nonvested equity awards granted was $288 million. This
expense is expected to be recorded over a weighted-average period of 1.4 years. The total fair value of stock incentive awards vested
was $307 million, $258 million and $275 million in the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.
Cruise Stock Incentive Awards Cruise granted RSUs that will settle in common shares of Cruise Holdings in the years ended
December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. Stock options were granted in common shares of Cruise Holdings in the years ended December
31, 2022 and 2021. In March 2022, Cruise modified its RSUs that settle in Cruise Class B Common Shares to remove the liquidity
vesting condition such that all granted RSU awards vest solely upon satisfaction of a service condition. The service condition for the
majority of these awards is satisfied over four years. Upon modification, 31 million RSUs whose service condition was previously
met became immediately vested, thereby resulting in the immediate recognition of compensation expense. In addition, at Cruise's
election, GM intends to conduct quarterly tender offers whereby holders of Cruise Class B Common Shares issued to settle vested
awards can tender their shares generally at the fair value of Cruise’s common stock. The planned tenders result in certain awards to
be classified as liabilities and other awards to be presented in temporary equity, which triggers the immediate recognition of
incremental compensation expense associated with the stock options. These awards were granted under Cruise's 2018 Employee
Incentive Plan approved by Cruise Holdings' Board of Directors in August 2018. Shares awarded under the plan are subject to
forfeiture if the participant leaves the company for reasons other than those permitted under the plan. Stock options vest ratably over
four to 10 years, as defined in the terms of each award. Stock options expire 10 years from the grant date.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)
Our weighted-average assumptions used to value Cruise stock options are a dividend yield of 0.00% and 0.00%, expected
volatility of 57.18% and 57.03%, a risk-free interest rate of 2.37% and 1.31%, and an expected option life of 6.61 and 5.49 years for
options issued during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. There were no options issued during the year ended December
31, 2020. The expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of comparable public company data as Cruise Holdings is not
publicly traded and therefore, does not have any trading history of its common stock.
Total compensation expense related to Cruise Holdings' share-based awards was $1.6 billion for the year ended December 31,
2022, which, when excluding the compensation expense for the period April 1, 2022 through December 31, 2022, primarily
represents the impact of the modification to outstanding awards, and an insignificant amount for the years ended December 31, 2021
and 2020. GM conducted quarterly tender offers and paid approximately $0.6 billion in cash to settle tendered Cruise Class B
Common Shares during the year ended December 31, 2022. No cash was paid to settle share-based awards for the three months
ended March 31, 2022. Total unrecognized compensation expense for Cruise Holdings’ nonvested equity awards granted was $1.7
billion at December 31, 2022. Total units outstanding were 86 million at December 31, 2022. The expense related to RSUs and stock
options is expected to be recorded over a weighted-average period of 1.7 years.
Note 23. Segment Reporting
We analyze the results of our business through the following reportable segments: GMNA, GMI, Cruise and GM Financial. The
chief operating decision-maker evaluates the operating results and performance of our automotive segments and Cruise through
EBIT-adjusted, which is presented net of noncontrolling interests. The chief operating decision-maker evaluates GM Financial
through EBT-adjusted because interest income and interest expense are part of operating results when assessing and measuring the
operational and financial performance of the segment. Each segment has a manager responsible for executing our strategic
initiatives. While not all vehicles within a segment are individually profitable on a fully allocated cost basis, those vehicles attract
customers to dealer showrooms and help maintain sales volumes for other, more profitable vehicles and contribute towards meeting
required fuel efficiency standards. As a result of these and other factors, we do not manage our business on an individual brand or
vehicle basis.
Substantially all of the trucks, crossovers, cars and automobile parts produced are marketed through retail dealers in North
America and through distributors and dealers outside of North America, the substantial majority of which are independently owned.
In addition to the products sold to dealers for consumer retail sales, trucks, crossovers and cars are also sold to fleet customers,
including daily rental car companies, commercial fleet customers, leasing companies and governments. Fleet sales are completed
through the dealer network and in some cases directly with fleet customers. Retail and fleet customers can obtain a wide range of
after-sale vehicle services and products through the dealer network, such as maintenance, light repairs, collision repairs, vehicle
accessories and extended service warranties.
GMNA meets the demands of customers in North America and GMI primarily meets the demands of customers outside North
America, with vehicles developed, manufactured and/or marketed under the Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet and GMC brands. We also
have equity ownership stakes in entities that meet the demands of customers in other countries, primarily China, with vehicles
developed, manufactured and/or marketed under the Baojun, Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet and Wuling brands. Cruise is our global
segment responsible for the development and commercialization of AV technology, and includes AV-related engineering and other
costs. We provide automotive financing services through our GM Financial segment.
Our automotive interest income and interest expense, legacy costs from the Opel/Vauxhall Business (primarily pension costs),
corporate expenditures and certain nonsegment-specific revenues and expenses are recorded centrally in Corporate. Corporate assets
primarily consist of cash and cash equivalents, marketable debt securities and intersegment balances. All intersegment balances and
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures
Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that
information required to be disclosed in reports filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within
the specified time periods and accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and
principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.
Our management, with the participation of our CEO and CFO, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act) as of December 31, 2022 as required
by paragraph (b) of Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15. Based on this evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and
procedures were effective as of December 31, 2022.
Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and
maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act.
This system is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Because of the inherent limitations of
internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls,
misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
Our management performed an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting at December 31,
2022, utilizing the criteria discussed in the “Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)” issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The objective of this assessment was to determine whether our internal
control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022. Based on management's assessment, we have concluded that
our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022.
The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP (PCAOB ID: 42), an
independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report included herein.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There have not been any changes in our internal control over financial
reporting during the three months ended December 31, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
