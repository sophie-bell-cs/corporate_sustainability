PART I
ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 
Company Overview
 
United Health Products, Inc. (“UHP or the “Company”) develops, manufactures, and markets a patented hemostatic
gauze for the healthcare and wound care sectors. Our gauze product, HemoStyp®, is a neutralized, oxidized, regenerated
cellulose (“NORC”) derived from cotton and designed to absorb exudate/drainage from superﬁcial wounds and help control
bleeding. We are in the process of seeking regulatory approval to sell our Hemostyp product line into the U.S. Class III and
European Union CE Mark surgical markets.
 
Recent Developments
 
The following developments in the Company’s business have occurred during 2022 and prior to the ﬁling of this report:
 
 · During 2022, the Company worked to address certain deﬁciencies in its Premarket Approval (PMA) application
that were identiﬁed by the FDA in 2021. These were largely related to the need for standardized procedures for
our manufacturing process, and quality assurance procedures for ﬁnished, customer ready products. As of the
date of this report we have implemented procedures and Good Manufacturing Practices that are responsive to
the deﬁciencies identiﬁed by the FDA. We are currently conducting testing of ﬁnished HemoStyp product to
ensure consistent and uniform production and to conﬁrm our packaging procedures, which we outsource to an
ISO 14385 certiﬁed partner, meet the FDA requirements for Class III products. Upon completion of this testing,
we will submit a revised PMA application to the FDA for their review.
 
Our HemoStyp Gauze Products
 
HemoStyp hemostatic gauze is a natural substance created from chemically treated cellulose derived from cotton.
It is an eﬀective hemostatic agent registered with the FDA for superﬁcial use under a 510(k) approval obtained in 2012 to
help control bleeding from open wounds and body cavities. The HemoStyp hemostatic material contains no chemical
additives, thrombin, collagen or animal-derived products, and is hypoallergenic. When the product comes in contact with
blood it expands slightly and quickly converts to a translucent gel that subsequently breaks down into glucose and salts.
Because of its benign impact on body tissue and the fact that it degrades to non-toxic end products, HemoStyp does not
impede the healing of body tissue as compared to certain competing hemostatic products. Laboratory testing has shown
HemoStyp to be 100% absorbable in the human body within 24 hours, compared to days or weeks with competing organic
regenerated cellulose products. A human trial conducted in 2019 and 2020 demonstrated the eﬀectiveness of HemoStyp in
vascular, thoracic and abdominal surgical procedures.
 
HemoStyp hemostatic gauze is a ﬂexible, silk-like material that is applied by placing the gauze onto the bleeding
tissue. The supple material can be easily folded and manipulated as needed to ﬁt the size of the wound or incision. In
surface bleeding and surgical situations, the product quickly converts to a translucent gel that allows the physician or
surgeon to monitor the coagulation process. The gel maintains a neutral pH level, which avoids damaging the surrounding
tissue. In superﬁcial bleeding situations, HemoStyp can be bonded to an adhesive plastic bandage or integrated into a
traditional gauze component to address a broad range of needs, including traumatic bleeding injuries and prolonged
bleeding following hemodialysis.

Potential Target Markets
 
Our HemoStyp material is currently cut to several sizes and conﬁguration and marketed as HemoStyp Gauze. Our
potential customer base includes, without limitation, the following:
 
  • Hospitals and Surgery Centers for all Internal Surgical usage (in the event we obtain FDA Class III approval)
  • Hospitals, Clinics and Physicians for external trauma
  • EMS, Fire Departments and other First Responders
  • Military Medical Care Providers
  • Hemodialysis centers
  • Nursing Homes and Assisted Living Facilities
  • Dental and Oral & Maxillofacial Surgery Oﬃces
  • Veterinary hospitals
 
Primary Strategy
 
Our HemoStyp technology received an FDA 510(k) approval in 2012 for use in external or superﬁcial bleeding
situations and we believe there is an opportunity for HemoStyp products to address unmet needs in several medical
applications that represent attractive commercial opportunities. However, the Class III surgical markets, both domestic
and international, represent the most attractive market for our products due to the smaller number of competitors oﬀering
Class III approved hemostatic agents and the resulting premium pricing for products that can meet the demanding
requirements of the human surgical environment. We believe that our extensive laboratory testing and our completed
human trial indicate that the HemoStyp technology could successfully compete against established Class III market
participants, and could gain a signiﬁcant market share. There can be no assurance that an FDA Premarket Approval (PMA)
will be granted.
 
In 2018, we made the decision to focus our eﬀorts and resources on accessing these Class III markets to maximize
the value potential of our HemoStyp products. The Class III PMA process required a substantial investment of time and
resources so we made the strategic determination to pause our sales and marketing to non-Class III markets in order to
devote our full attention to the PMA process. In the fourth quarter of 2021, with our PMA application largely complete and
under review by the FDA, we re-engaged with certain consumers and distributors of 510(k) hemostatic products with the
objective of developing a revenue channel in this market going forward. Our primary market focus for this initiative
includes the ﬁrst-aid, dental surgery and emergency medicine sectors.
 
In anticipation of receiving a Class III PMA (which cannot be assured), we are evaluating paths to rapidly grow our
revenue and proﬁts in all potential market segments, with the objective of maximizing shareholder value. We do not
intend to pursue the full commercialization of our products independently nor to remain an independent company in the
long term. Options under consideration include (i) a sale or merger of the Company with an industry leader in the wound
care and surgical device sectors, which may include a pre-sale collaboration on commercialization and distribution and (ii)
one or more commercial partnerships with established market participants, without any speciﬁc, associated sale or
merger transaction.

The Company has been contacted by several medical technology companies that are active in the surgical
equipment and hemostatic products sectors, and who have expressed an interest in the Company’s products and business
strategy. In response to these inbound contacts, we have held discussions to evaluate the potential commercial
partnerships in anticipation of an FDA decision on our Class III PMA application. There can be no assurances that any
speciﬁc transaction will occur as a result of these discussions. No assurances can be given that the Company will identify
any commercialization candidate(s) or complete a transaction.
 
Manufacturing and Packaging of our Products
 
The Company’s NORC products will be manufactured to our speciﬁcations and using our equipment through a
contract manufacturing arrangement with an FDA certiﬁed supplier that maintains stringent quality control protocols to
assure the uniformity and quality of all of our gauze products. Information on the manufacturing process and our
manufacturer’s facility has been submitted as part of our PMA submission. Our gauze products are cut to size, packaged
and sterilized by service providers in the United States.
 
Patents and Trademarks
 
Our NORC technology is protected through patents ﬁled with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Oﬃce, which protection
currently runs through 2029. In 2020 and 2021, we ﬁled additional U.S. and International patents that protect the use of our
NORC technology in a gel or hydrocolloid formulation.
 
On January 21, 2021, the U.S. Patent Oﬃce provided notiﬁcation of publication of the Company’s patent application
for the method of forming and using a hemostatic hydrocolloid. This publication does not imply any assurance of the
receipt of the patent but establishes an obligation of any party that seeks to use the applicable method to pay royalties for
the right to do so. The patent application for this process remains pending as of the date of this ﬁling.
 
On February 11, 2021, the Company was notiﬁed that its application to establish global patent protection for the
process of creating and deploying a hydrocolloid (or gel) format of its HemoStyp technology was accepted for publication
under the procedures of the Patent Cooperation Treaty (“PCT”), an international patent law treaty which provides a uniﬁed
procedure for ﬁling a patent application in most foreign countries. We previously ﬁled provisional patent applications for
our HemoStyp hydrocolloid process in 2020. In January 2022, the Company initiated steps to register its hydrocolloid
patent in the European common market and in additional foreign countries where we intend to commercialize any future
HemoStyp gel formats. We can give no assurance that foreign registration of our patents will be granted in any of these
jurisdictions.
 
The Company has registered trademarks for the following product formats:
 
 •Boo Boo Strips
 •The Ultimate Bandage
 •Hemostrips
 • CelluSTAT
 •Nik Fix
 
Competition
 
The wound care products market in the United States is concentrated among large and established companies such
as Baxter International, Becton Dickinson & Company, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Johnson & Johnson and 3M
Company, each of which have greater capital and operational resources than us. Our hemostatic gauze product will
directly compete in the gauze markets served by these companies. In this market, competitive factors include product
performance, price, breadth of product oﬀerings, value-added service programs, service and delivery, credit terms, and
customer support.

Government Regulation
 
We are subject to oversight by various federal and state governmental entities and we are subject to, and aﬀected
by, a variety of federal and state laws, regulations and policies generally applicable to the healthcare and medical device
industries.
 
Environmental Matters
 
The Company may be subject to, or aﬀected by, environmental legislation including, among others, the Toxic
Substances Control Act, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA or Superfund) and
the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. There may be laws and regulations that exist or that may come to pass that
may also have an impact on the Company in ways that we cannot foresee. Compliance with the multitude of regulations
issued by federal, state, provincial and local administrative agencies that may apply to the Company can be burdensome
and costly. To date, the Company has not been impacted by these laws and regulations.
 
Research and Development Expenditures
 
In the years ending December 31, 2022 and 2021 we incurred research and development expenditures of $624,564
and $237,458, respectively.
 
Personnel
 
As of March 27, 2023, we have seven full-time personnel working under consulting agreements. Additionally, we
have four Medical Advisory Board members.
 
ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS
 
We are engaged in the development, sale and distribution of hemostatic gauze products to stop superﬁcial bleeding. As we
develop our business, there are numerous and varied risks, known and unknown, that may prevent us from achieving our
goals. If any of these risks actually occur, our business, ﬁnancial condition or results of operation may be materially
adversely aﬀected. In such case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and investors could lose all or part
of their investment.

RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS
 
We have a history of operating losses and we may continue to lose money in the future
 
For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had a net loss of $1,687,501 and $30,549,183,
respectively. We may continue to lose money in the future, and we will rely on ﬁnancing to fund our business strategy for
the foreseeable future as discussed in the Risk Factor “We will need additional ﬁnancing to execute our business plan and
fund operations, which may not be available”.
 
We can provide no assurances that our Class III application for internal surgical procedures in the U.S.
market will be approved by the FDA.
 
In response to the FDA’s comments and questions to our 2021 and 2022 PMA submissions, we have developed and
incorporated several product design, manufacturing and quality assurance procedures into our production process. Upon
completion of certain ﬁnished product testing that is being conducts by outside laboratories we will submit a revised
application to the FDA. There can be no assurance that our revised application, once resubmitted, will lead to a successful
FDA decision regarding a PMA.
  
No assurances can be given that our Management plans to penetrate all market segments will be
successful.
 
We continue to believe that the Class III surgical markets, both domestic and international, represent the most
attractive market for our products due to the limited competition from other Class III approved ORC (Oxidized Regenerated
Cellulose) products and the resulting premium pricing for hemostatic agents that can meet the demanding requirements of
the human surgical environment. As of the ﬁling date of this Form 10-K, the FDA review process is ongoing and we are
preparing to submit an application for CE Mark approval in order to access the European and other markets. In the event
we receive Class III and CE Mark approvals, which cannot be assured, we are evaluating the best paths grow our revenue
and proﬁts in all potential markets, which could include one or more commercial partnerships and licensing agreements
with established market participants or an acquisition/merger agreement with any such participants, each as an
alternative to raising the necessary capital to establish and grow our own marketing and distribution capabilities via
organic growth. We will carefully evaluate the returns on investment to create shareholder value of each of these
strategies. No assurances can be given that our plans to penetrate all market segments or be acquired/merged with an
established market participant will be successful on terms satisfactory to us, if at all.
 
We can provide no assurances that ongoing discussions with potential commercial partners and acquirers
will result in the occurrence of a speciﬁc transaction.
 
The Company has been contacted by several medical technology companies that are active in the surgical
equipment and hemostatic products sectors, and who have expressed an interest in the Company’s products and business
strategy. In response to these inbound contacts, and to maximize shareholder value, the Company continues to consider a
range of strategic alternatives, which include, without limitation, entering into one or more commercial and distribution
partnerships, a sale of the Company or a standalone growth plan. There can be no assurances that any speciﬁc transaction
will occur as a result of these discussions. No assurances can be given that the Company will identify a suitable
acquisition or commercialization partnership candidate(s) or complete any transaction on terms that are in the best
interests of shareholders.
 
 
7
 
 
We will need additional ﬁnancing to execute our business plan and fund operations, which may not be
available.
 
We currently have a working capital deﬁcit, minimal cash and limited sales of our products. As result of the
Company’s ﬁnancial position, we may not be able to execute our current business plan and fund business operations long
enough to achieve proﬁtability. Our ultimate success will depend upon our ability to raise additional capital. There can be
no assurance that additional funds will be available when needed from any source or, if available, will be available on
terms that are acceptable to us.
 
We will pursue required additional capital through various means, including commercial collaborations and debt or
equity ﬁnancings. Future ﬁnancings through equity investments are likely to be dilutive to existing stockholders. Also, the
terms of securities we may issue in future capital transactions may be more favorable for our new investors. Newly issued
securities may include preferences, superior voting rights, the issuance of warrants or other derivative securities. The
issuances of incentive awards under existing and future employee incentive plans, may have additional dilutive eﬀects.
Further, we may incur substantial costs in pursuing future capital and/or ﬁnancing, including investment banking fees,
legal fees, accounting fees, printing and distribution expenses and other costs. We may also be required to recognize non-
cash expenses in connection with certain securities we may issue, such as convertible notes and warrants, which may
adversely impact our ﬁnancial condition.
 
Our ability to obtain needed ﬁnancing may be impaired by such factors as capital markets disruptions, both
generally and speciﬁcally relating to the healthcare industry, and events that have a negative impact on existing and
potential investors or funding sources. If the amount of capital we are able to raise from ﬁnancing activities, together with
our revenues from operations, is not suﬃcient to satisfy our capital needs we may be required to cease operations.
 
No guarantee of market acceptance.
 
Our success is dependent on market acceptance of our hemostatic gauze products. We cannot be certain that
healthcare professionals and purchasing decision makers will conclude that our products oﬀer a superior performance or
value proposition, in any or all of the target markets we have identiﬁed, or that we will attain the level of market
acceptance necessary to generate adequate revenues to cover our business costs and generate a return for investors.
 
We may be dependent upon commercial relationships to conduct our operations and implement our
strategy.
 
Our proposed strategy includes the use of distribution and commercial partnerships to market and sell our
hemostatic gauze products. We currently do not have any such commercial relationships. We may not be able to establish
these relationships, or if established, we may not be able to maintain them. In addition, the dynamics of our relationships
with strategic partners may require us to incur expenses or undertake activities we would not otherwise be inclined to in
order to fulﬁll our obligations to these partners or maintain our relationships. If these relationships are not established or
maintained, our business prospects may be limited, which could diminish our ability to conduct our operations. We can
provide no assurances that distribution agreements will be entered into on terms satisfactory to us, if at all, or that our
operations will be proﬁtable as a result of these distribution agreements.
 
 
8
 
 
We could experience diﬃculties in our supply chain.
 
Our NORC products are manufactured in Asia and the United States to our speciﬁcations. Unforeseen events at any
manufacturing or packaging location may result in a disruption of production that could negatively impact our ability to
supply our customers and generate revenues. We own certain specialized production equipment which is installed at our
own manufacturing location which is not readily available should we need to replace it. While we intend to maintain
signiﬁcant supplies of ﬁnished product inventory, any prolonged disruption this facility could have a material adverse
impact on our operations and business.
 
We are currently dependent on one hemostatic gauze product to generate income in the future.
 
The Company’s hemostatic gauze products are currently our sole source of potential revenue in the future. While
we have multiple formats of this product and hope to access new markets upon receipt of a Class III PMA, we cannot
provide assurance that our product will be accepted by potential customers or that new, superior hemostatic technologies
will not be introduced that negatively impact the market perceptions of our own products. Unless we are able to develop
or acquire additional product lines, the failure to develop a commercial market for this product line will materially
adversely aﬀect our operations.
 
Our business may suﬀer if we do not attract and retain talented personnel.
 
Our success will depend in large measure on the abilities, expertise, judgment, discretion, integrity and good faith
of our management and other personnel in conducting our intended business. In addition, we depend on management and
employees to correctly interpret and respond to market data, economic and other conditions to locate and adopt
appropriate business opportunities. We presently have a small management team, which we intend to expand in
conjunction with our planned operations and growth. We intend to ensure that management and any key employees are
appropriately compensated; however, their continued service to the Company cannot be guaranteed. If we are unable to
attract and retain additional key management personnel and enter into satisfactory employment and other agreements,
our business may be adversely aﬀected.
 
We may not be able to adequately protect our technologies or intellectual property rights.
 
Our ability to achieve commercial or strategic success will depend in part on maintaining patent protection and
trade secret protection of our technologies as well as successfully defending our intellectual property against third-party
challenges. We will only be able to protect our technologies from unauthorized use by third parties to the extent that valid
and enforceable patents or trade secrets cover them. Furthermore, the degree of future protection of our proprietary rights
is uncertain because legal means aﬀord only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to
gain or keep our competitive advantage. Additionally, legal enforcement of intellectual property rights is costly and we
may not have the ﬁnancial resources to take the necessary legal action to protect our rights.
 
If our intellectual property positions are challenged, invalidated, circumvented, or expire, or if we fail to prevail in
future intellectual property litigation, our business could be adversely aﬀected. We have created multiple variations of our
gauze product and will protect each of these new generation platforms and product with additional intellectual property.
Our success depends in part on our ability to defend our intellectual property rights. The patent positions of
pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can be highly uncertain and often involve complex legal, scientiﬁc, and
factual questions. Third parties may seek to challenge, invalidate, or circumvent our intellectual property rights. In
addition, our patent positions might not protect us against competitors with similar products or technologies because
competing products or technologies may not infringe our patents. Also, there are third parties who have patents or pending
patent applications that they may claim necessitate payment of a royalty or prevent us from commercializing our patent
in certain territories. Patent disputes are frequent, costly and can preclude, delay, or increase the cost of
commercialization of products.
 
 
9
 
 
We have identiﬁed various material weaknesses in our internal control over ﬁnancial reporting which could
aﬀect our ability to timely and accurately report our results of operations and ﬁnancial condition. These
material weaknesses may not have been fully remediated as of the ﬁling date of this report and we cannot
assure you that other material weaknesses will not be identiﬁed in the future.
 
Our Chief Executive Oﬃcer and Principal Financial Oﬃcer have concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, we had
material weaknesses in our internal controls over ﬁnancial reporting and that, as a result, our disclosure controls and
procedures and our internal controls over ﬁnancial reporting were not eﬀective at such date. A material weakness is a
deﬁciency, or combination of deﬁciencies, in internal control over ﬁnancial reporting that creates a reasonable possibility
that a material misstatement of our annual or interim ﬁnancial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely
basis.
 
In addition, we believe that we continued to have material weaknesses in our internal control over ﬁnancial
reporting subsequent to December 31, 2022. See “Controls and Procedures” under Item 9A for a detailed discussion of the
material weaknesses identiﬁed as of December 31, 2022 and possible material weaknesses as of subsequent periods.
Although we are in the process of implementing remedial measures to address all of the identiﬁed material weaknesses,
our assessment of the impact of these measures has not been completed as of the ﬁling date of this report, and we cannot
assure you that these measures will be adequate. Moreover, we cannot assure you that additional material weaknesses in
our internal control over ﬁnancial reporting will not arise or be identiﬁed in the future.
 
As a result, we must continue to improve our operational, information technology, and ﬁnancial systems,
infrastructure, procedures, and controls, as well as continue to expand, train, retain, and manage our employee base. Any
failure to do so, or any diﬃculties we encounter during implementation, could result in additional material weaknesses or
in material misstatements in our ﬁnancial statements. These misstatements could result in a future restatement of our
ﬁnancial statements, could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations, or could cause investors to lose conﬁdence in
our reported ﬁnancial information, leading to a decline in our stock price.
 
Our independent registered public accounting ﬁrm has expressed substantial doubt about our ability to
continue as a going concern. This could make it more diﬃcult for us to raise funds and adversely aﬀect our
relationships with creditors, investors and suppliers.
 
Our auditors believe that substantial doubt exists regarding our ability to remain in business. We cannot provide
any assurance that we will in fact operate our business proﬁtably or obtain suﬃcient ﬁnancing to sustain our business in
the event we are not successful in our eﬀorts to generate suﬃcient revenue and operating cash ﬂow. The expression of
such doubt by our independent registered public accounting ﬁrm or our inability to overcome the factors leading to such
doubt could have a material adverse eﬀect on our relationships with prospective customers, creditors, investors and
suppliers, and therefore could have a material adverse eﬀect on our business.
 
 
10
 
 
The healthcare industry is subject to extensive government regulation, which can result in increased costs,
delays, limits on its operating ﬂexibility and competitive disadvantages.
 
The healthcare industry is generally subject to extensive regulatory requirements. Adhering to these requirements
generally carries signiﬁcant costs to industry participants, including our Company. Given our limited ﬁnancial resources
these signiﬁcant costs may adversely aﬀect our business and ﬁnancial results. If we are unable to pass on these costs
through our product pricing they would negatively impact our proﬁt margin.
 
Healthcare insurance legislation may lead to unintended adverse eﬀects for businesses involved in our industry.
New legislation that gives the Federal government greater regulatory powers may lead to negative consequences for
certain aspects of our business. The full scope of the ongoing uncertainty in healthcare related legislation may not be
known for several years, making it diﬃcult to predict the future consequences that would create challenges to our
Company, or if we can overcome them.
 
Failure to comply with laws or government regulations could result in penalties.
 
Certain government requirements for technologies in the healthcare market may require licensure or mandatory
minimum standards relating to the provision of products and services. Failure to comply with these requirements could
materially aﬀect our ability to expand into new or existing markets. Future regulatory developments may also cause
disruptions to our operations.
 
GENERAL RISK FACTORS
 
We are subject to the reporting requirements of the federal securities laws, which can be expensive.
 
We are a public reporting company and, accordingly, subject to the information and reporting requirements of the
Exchange Act and other federal and state securities laws, including compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The
costs of preparing and ﬁling annual and quarterly reports, proxy statements and other information with the SEC and
furnishing audited reports to stockholders increase our operating costs.
 
It is time consuming, diﬃcult and costly for us to develop and implement the internal controls and reporting
procedures required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We may need to hire additional ﬁnancial reporting, internal controls and
other ﬁnance personnel in order to develop and implement appropriate internal controls and reporting procedures. If we
are unable to comply with the internal control’s requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we may not be able to obtain the
independent accountant certiﬁcations required by that Act.
 
 
11
 
 
Public company compliance requirements may make it more diﬃcult to attract and retain oﬃcers and
directors.
 
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act and rules subsequently implemented by the SEC have required changes in corporate
governance practices of public companies. Compliance with the new rules and regulations increases our operating costs
and makes certain activities more time consuming and costly than if we were not a public company. As a public company,
these new rules and regulations make it more diﬃcult and expensive for us to obtain director and oﬃcer liability
insurance. As a result, it may be more diﬃcult for us to attract and retain qualiﬁed persons to serve on our Board of
Directors or as executive oﬃcers.
 
There exist risks to stockholders relating to dilution: authorization of additional securities and reduction of
percentage share ownership following investment.
 
To the extent that additional shares of common stock are issued, our existing stockholders would experience
dilution of their respective ownership interests in the Company. Additionally, if the Company issues a substantial number
of shares of common stock in connection with or following an investment, a change in control of the Company may occur
which may aﬀect, among other things, the Company’s ability to utilize net operating loss carry forwards, if any.
Furthermore, the issuance of a substantial number of shares of common stock may adversely aﬀect prevailing market
prices for our common stock and could impair the Company’s ability to raise additional capital through the sale of its
equity securities. The Company has in the past and may in the future compensate certain consultants and other service
providers using our shares of common stock, which would result in further dilution for our existing stockholders.
 
Our stock price may be volatile.
 
The market price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile and could ﬂuctuate widely in response to
various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including the following:
 
  • changes in the healthcare industry;
  • competitive pricing pressures;
  • our ability to obtain working capital ﬁnancing;
  • additions or departures of key personnel;
  • our ability to execute our business plan;
  • operating results that fall short of expectations;
  • loss of certain material strategic relationships;
  • regulatory developments;
 • economic and other external factors, including among others, eﬀects on the markets stemming from the COVID-
19 pandemic; and
  • period-to-period ﬂuctuations in our ﬁnancial results.
 
In addition, the securities markets have from time-to-time experienced signiﬁcant price and volume ﬂuctuations
that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These market ﬂuctuations may also materially
and adversely aﬀect the market price of our common stock.
 
We have not paid dividends in the past and do not expect to pay dividends in the future. Any return on
investment may be limited to changes in the value of our common stock.
 
We have never paid cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate doing so in the foreseeable future.
The payment of cash dividends on our common stock will depend on earnings, ﬁnancial condition and other business and
economic factors aﬀecting us at such time as our board of directors may consider relevant. If we do not pay dividends,
return on investment will only occur if our stock price appreciates.

There is currently no established market for our common stock, and we cannot ensure that one will ever
develop or be sustained.
 
The Company’s common stock is available for trading on the OTC Pink. Management considers the market for our
common stock to be limited. We can provide no assurances that an established trading market for our common stock will
exist in the future.
 
Our common stock is deemed a “penny stock”, which may make it more diﬃcult for our investors to sell
their shares.
 
Our common stock is subject to the “penny stock” rules adopted under Section 15(g) of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934. The penny stock rules apply to companies whose common stock is not listed on a national securities exchange
and trades at less than $5.00 per share or that have tangible net worth of less than $5,000,000 ($2,000,000 if the company
has been operating for three or more years). These rules require, among other things, that brokers who trade penny stock
to persons other than “established customers” complete certain documentation, make suitability inquiries of investors
and provide investors with certain information concerning trading in the security, including a risk disclosure document and
quote information under certain circumstances. Many brokers have decided not to trade penny stocks because of the
requirements of the penny stock rules and, as a result, the number of broker-dealers willing to act as market makers in
such securities is limited. If we remain subject to the penny stock rules for any signiﬁcant period, it could have an adverse
eﬀect on the market, if any, for our securities. In as much as our securities are subject to the penny stock rules, investors
may ﬁnd it more diﬃcult to dispose of our securities.
 
Oﬀers or availability for sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock may cause the price of
our common stock to decline.
 
If certain of our stockholders seek to sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market upon the
expiration of any holding period under Rule 144, or expiration of lock-up periods applicable to outstanding shares, or
issued upon the exercise of outstanding options or warrants, it could create a circumstance commonly referred to as an
“overhang” and in anticipation of which the market price of our common stock could fall. The existence of an overhang,
whether or not sales have occurred or are occurring, also could impair our ability to raise additional ﬁnancing through the
sale of equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem reasonable or appropriate.

ITEM 2. DESCRIPTION OF PROPERTY
 
The Company is utilizing on a temporary basis, rent free, a central mailing address as its principal executive oﬃce,
located at 526 Commerce Circle, Ste. #120, Mesquite, NV 89027.  On October 31, 2022, the Company signed a 120-day
lease for 600 square feet of space in Hammonton, New Jersey to install, commission and test its medical device
equipment. The Company is a virtual company with personnel in Nevada and ﬁve other states working remotely.
 
ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
 
Philip Forman, who served as Chairman, a director, Chief Executive Oﬃcer and Chief Medical Advisor of the
Company at various times between 2011 and October 2015, ﬁled a lawsuit against the Company and our then-Chief
Executive Oﬃcer, Douglas Beplate, in the United States District Court of the District of Nevada. The plaintiﬀ has claimed,
among other things: that the June 25, 2015 Amendment to his November 10, 2014 Employment Agreement with the
Company, which terminated the Employment Agreement on October 1, 2015, is not enforceable due to lack of
consideration; that a July 22, 2015 Stock Purchase Agreement pursuant to which the plaintiﬀ sold Company shares issued
to him under the Amendment to a third a party is unenforceable (despite the fact that all payment for the shares under the
Stock Purchase Agreement was made); that the plaintiﬀ’s 2014 Employment Agreement remains valid and that he is
entitled to cash and stock compensation under that Employment Agreement (without giving regard to the Amendment);
and that the Company and Mr. Beplate defrauded the plaintiﬀ relating to the foregoing. The plaintiﬀ is seeking declaratory
judgment regarding the parties’ relative rights under the Employment Agreement, the Amendment and the Stock Purchase
Agreement; money damages of no less than $2,795,000; and punitive damages of $8,280,000. The Company ﬁled a
motion to dismiss the plaintiﬀ’s claims which was denied on March 19, 2020. On May 5, 2021, the plaintiﬀ provided a
deposition as instructed by the Court, subsequent to which the Company ﬁled a motion for dismissal of this proceeding. On
February 14, 2022, the Court issued an Order which declared the Amendment to be unenforceable and thus the terms of
the original Employment Agreement to remain in eﬀect. The Order also noted that the Company is not a party to the Stock
Purchase Agreement, and the Employment Agreement does not constitute a prior agreement that could have been
superseded by the Stock Purchase Agreement.
 
In July 2022, United Health Products ﬁled a motion to reopen discovery for the purpose of developing additional
issues it wished to raise at trial.  At the beginning of August 2022, the court denied United Health Products’ request to
reopen discovery.  The court instructed counsel for both parties to meet and confer regarding a Joint Trial Order to be ﬁled
with the court.  The Joint Trial Order generally details the parties’ position on which issues are to be addressed at trial.  The
parties are currently seeking to reach agreement on what issues should be addressed at trial.  Once the issues have been
agreed upon, the Joint Trial Order will be ﬁled with the court and the court will set a trial date.  Concurrently with the
completion of the Joint Trial Order, the parties are engaged in various settlement negotiations. 
 
In August 2020, United Health Products ﬁled suit against its former auditors, in Utah State Court, asserting claims
related to professional negligence and breach of ﬁduciary duty. The Company and the defendant through mediation
reached an agreement on settlement in which the defendant paid the Company $392,000 in September 2022.
 
Due to uncertainties inherent in litigation, we cannot predict the outcome of the legal proceedings described herein.

Year ended December 31, 2022 versus year ended December 31, 2021
 
During the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had $37,500 and $59 of revenues, respectively.
The Company fulﬁlled an order to one customer, which accounted for all the revenue during the year ended December 31,
2022.  The Company generated minimal revenues during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 due to focusing its
capital and resources towards seeking a Class III PMA.
 
Total operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were $2,820,895 and $29,800,669,
respectively. The decrease in operating expenses is due primarily to a $26,377,647 decrease in stock-based compensation
expense, a decrease of $224,972 in loss on settlement of debt and a decrease of $232,000 of litigation settlement
expense (see Note 7 to the ﬁnancial statements) compared to 2021.
 
The decrease in stock-based compensation is primarily related to vesting and amortization of RSUs. During the
year ended December 31, 2021, the Company amended the RSU agreement with its former Chief Executive Oﬃcer and
Chairman. The amendment resulted in the vesting of 21,970,000 RSUs along with the issuance of an additional 2,000,000
shares of restricted stock as a bonus. The change in vesting and issuance of the bonus shares of common stock resulted in
the immediate recognition of $26,127,300 in stock-based compensation expense. The Company also recognized $43,121
of stock-based compensation due to the amortization of the RSUs that vested on January 1, 2021, issued 100,000 shares of
common stock for settlement of a consulting agreement valued at $111,000, issued 125,000 shares of common stock for
services valued at $102,500 and issued 560,000 shares of common stock valued at $477,175 due to vesting of RSUs.
 
During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded $483,450 of stock-based compensation. The
Company issued 1,170,000 shares of common stock for services valued at $483,450 and did not have any RSUs vest
during the year ended December 31, 2022.
 
Other income (expense) for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $1,114,538 and $(748,548),
respectively. The increase in other income was due to other income of $1,402,981 oﬀset by total interest expense of
$78,845 and loss on settlement of debt of $209,598.  The increase in other income was due to the Company receiving
$392,000 as a settlement payment from its former auditor related to litigation and the receipt of $202,200 in cash and
2,085,258 shares of common stock as payment of $808,781 from its former Chief Executive Oﬃcer to satisfy a
disgorgement obligation during the year ended December 31, 2022 compared with the Company  receiving $304,273 for
settlement of its December 2019 arbitration with Maxim during the year ended December 31, 2021.
 
The decrease in interest expense is primarily due to the amortization of beneﬁcial conversion features on
convertible notes payable and convertible notes payable – related party during the year ended December 31, 2022 totaling
$16,533 compared to $608,710 in the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in the loss on settlement of debt is
due to the Company issuing common stock with a fair value of $458,001 for the settlement of an aggregate of $330,626 of
accrued liabilities and accrued liabilities – related parties and recording $82,223 in loss on settlement of debt related to
lowering the conversion price of a convertible note as an inducement for conversion during the year ended December 31,
2022 compared to issuing shares of common stock with a fair value of $1,205,718 for the settlement of $771,148 of
various debts and accrued liabilities – related party during the year ended December 31, 2021.
 
Our net loss for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $1,687,501 as compared to a net loss of $30,549,183 for
the prior year. The decrease in the net loss was due to the Company having a decrease in operating expenses of
$26,979,774 along with an increase in other income (expense) from $(748,548) during the year ended December 31, 2021
to $1,114,538 for the year ended December 31, 2022, as explained above.

Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources
 
As of December 31, 2022, the Company had a negative working capital of $2,344,416. The Company has not yet
attained a level of operations, and for the foreseeable future will not be pursuing commercial operations, which will allow
it to meet its current overhead expense obligations. The report of our independent registered public accounting ﬁrm on our
2022 and 2021 ﬁnancial statements includes an explanatory paragraph expressing substantial doubt about our ability to
continue as a going concern. The Company generated minimal revenues during the years ended December 31, 2022 and
2021 due to focusing its capital and resources towards seeking a Class III PMA for its HemoStyp technology, and has
funded its initial operations with private placements, and unsecured loans from related parties. There can be no assurance
that adequate ﬁnancing will continue to be available to the Company and, if available, on terms that are favorable to the
Company. Our ability to continue as a going concern is also dependent on many events outside of our direct control,
including, among other things, our ability to achieve our business goals and objectives, as well as improvement in the
economic climate.
 
As discussed in Note 6 of the ﬁnancial statements, the Company entered into a common stock purchase agreement
(“CSPA”) with White Lion, which gives the Company the right, but not the obligation, to require White Lion to purchase up
to $10,000,000 of the Company’s common stock, subject to certain limitations and conditions set forth in the CSPA. As of
the date of this ﬁling, the Company has received $577,855 in proceeds from White Lion to pay for its operations and
ﬁnalization of its Class III PMA application. The sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities would be dilutive to
our shareholders. In addition, economic conditions and actions by policymaking bodies are contributing to rising interest
rates and signiﬁcant capital market volatility, which, along with increases in our borrowing levels, could increase our
future borrowing costs.
 
Cash Flows
 
The Company’s cash on hand as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $13,377 and $21,799, respectively.

proceeds from convertible notes – related party and $392,975 in proceeds from convertible notes payable oﬀset by

costs and repurchasing $50,000 of common stock.

Related Parties
 
Information concerning related party transactions is included in the ﬁnancial statements and related notes,
appearing elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K.
 
Critical Accounting Estimates
 
The preparation of ﬁnancial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles of the United
States (“GAAP”) requires estimates and assumptions that aﬀect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues
and expenses in the ﬁnancial statements and accompanying notes. Critical accounting estimates are those estimates
made in accordance with GAAP that involve a signiﬁcant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably
likely to have a material impact on the ﬁnancial condition or results of operations of the Company. Based on this
deﬁnition, we have the critical accounting estimates identiﬁed below. We also have other key accounting policies, which
involve the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that are signiﬁcant to understanding our results which are
found in Note 2 – Signiﬁcant Accounting Policies of the accompanying ﬁnancial statements. Although we believe that our
estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based upon information presently available. Actual
results may diﬀer signiﬁcantly from these estimates under diﬀerent assumptions, judgments, or conditions.
 
Stock-Based Compensation
 
The Company accounts for stock-based compensation under the provisions of ASC 718, Compensation-Stock
Compensation. Stock-based compensation expense for employees and non-employees is measured at the grant date fair
value. Stock-based compensation for all stock-based awards to employees and directors is recognized as an expense over
the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period.

Opinion on the Financial Statements
 
We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of United Health Products, Inc. as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and
the related statement of operations, stockholders’ deﬁciency, and cash ﬂows for each of the two years in the period ended

Going Concern
 
The accompanying ﬁnancial statements have been prepared assuming that the entity will continue as a going concern. As
discussed in Note 2 to the ﬁnancial statements, the entity has suﬀered recurring losses from operations and has a net
capital deﬁciency that raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans in
regard to these matters are also described in Note 2. The ﬁnancial statements do not include any adjustments that might
result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
 
Basis for Opinion
 
These ﬁnancial statements are the responsibility of the entity’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on these ﬁnancial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting ﬁrm registered with the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB") and are required to be independent with respect to United Health
Products, Inc. in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities
and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
 
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the ﬁnancial statements are free of material
misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. United Health Products, Inc. is not required to have, nor were we engaged to
perform, an audit of its internal control over ﬁnancial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an
understanding of internal control over ﬁnancial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
eﬀectiveness of the entity's internal control over ﬁnancial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
 
Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the ﬁnancial statements,
whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining,
on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the ﬁnancial statements. Our audits also included
evaluating the accounting principles used and signiﬁcant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the
overall presentation of the ﬁnancial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
 
Critical Audit Matters
 
Critical audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the ﬁnancial statements that were
communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that
are material to the ﬁnancial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. We
determined that there are no critical audit matters.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2022 AND 2021
 
Note 1. Description of the Business
 
United Health Products, Inc. (the “Company”) develops, manufactures, and markets a patented hemostatic gauze
for the healthcare and wound care sectors. Our gauze product, HemoStyp®, is a neutralized, oxidized, regenerated
cellulose derived from cotton and designed to absorb exudate/drainage from superﬁcial wounds and help control bleeding.
The Company in the process of seeking regulatory approval to sell our HemoStyp product line into the U.S. Class III and
European Union CE Mark surgical markets.
 
Note 2. Signiﬁcant Accounting Policies
 
Going Concern
 
The accompanying ﬁnancial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going
concern. The Company has incurred recurring net losses, negative working capital and operations have not provided cash
ﬂows. Additionally, the Company does not currently have suﬃcient revenue producing operations to cover its operating
expenses and meet its current obligations. In view of these factors, there is substantial doubt about the Company's ability
to continue as a going concern. The Company intends to ﬁnance its future development activities and its working capital
needs largely from the sale of public equity securities with some additional funding from other traditional ﬁnancing
sources, including term notes, until such time that funds provided by operations are suﬃcient to fund working capital and
other business requirements. The ﬁnancial statements of the Company do not include any adjustments relating to the
recoverability and classiﬁcation of recorded assets, or the amounts and classiﬁcations of liabilities that might be
necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.
 
Basis of Presentation
 
The Company prepares its ﬁnancial statements on the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
 
Use of Estimates
 
The preparation of ﬁnancial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the
Company’s management to make estimates and assumptions that aﬀect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at
the date of the ﬁnancial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reported period.
Changes in the economic environment, ﬁnancial markets, as well as in the healthcare industry, and any other parameters
used in determining these estimates, could cause actual results to diﬀer.
 
Cash and Cash Equivalents
 
The Company considers all highly liquid debt investments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be
cash equivalents.

Table of Contents
  
Fair Value Measurements
 
Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States deﬁne fair value as the exchange price that would be
received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the
asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Additionally, the inputs
used to measure fair value are prioritized based on a three-level hierarchy. This hierarchy requires entities to maximize
the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The three levels of inputs used to measure fair
value are as follows:
 
Level 1 — Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
 
Level 2 — Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1. We value assets and liabilities included in
this level using dealer and broker quotations, bid prices, quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets,
or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.
 
Level 3 — Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are signiﬁcant to the fair
value of the assets or liabilities. This includes certain pricing models, discounted cash ﬂow methodologies and similar
techniques that use signiﬁcant unobservable inputs.
 
Fair value estimates discussed herein are based upon certain market assumptions and pertinent information
available to management as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. The respective carrying value of certain on-balance-sheet
ﬁnancial instruments approximated their fair values due to the short-term nature of these instruments.
 
Income Taxes
 
The Company accounts for income taxes using a method that requires recognition of deferred tax assets and
liabilities for expected future tax consequences of temporary diﬀerences that currently exist between tax bases and
ﬁnancial reporting bases of the Company’s assets and liabilities which is commonly known as the asset and liability
method. In assessing the ability to realize deferred tax assets, the Company considers whether it is more likely than not
that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
 
The Company evaluates its tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing the Company’s
tax returns to determine whether the tax positions are ‘‘more-likely-than-not’’ of being sustained by the applicable tax
authority. Tax positions not deemed to meet the “more-likely-than-not” threshold are recorded as an expense in the
applicable year. The Company does not have a liability for any unrecognized tax beneﬁts. Management’s evaluation of
uncertain tax positions may be subject to review and adjustment at a later date based upon factors including, but not
limited to, an on-going analysis of tax laws, regulations and interpretations thereof, with due consideration given to the
fact that tax periods are open to examination by tax authorities.
 
As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company has approximately $21.8 and $20.0 million of net operating loss
carry-forwards, respectively, available to aﬀect future taxable income and has established a valuation allowance equal to
the tax beneﬁt of the net operating loss carry forwards and temporary diﬀerences as realization of the asset is not
assured.

Revenue Recognition
 
The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Under ASC
606, the Company recognizes revenue from the sale of its HemoStyp product by applying the following steps: (1) identify
the contract with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price;
(4) allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when each
performance obligation is satisﬁed.
 
The Company receives orders for its HemoStyp products directly from its customers. Revenues are recognized
based on the agreed upon sales or transaction price with the customer when control of the promised goods are transferred
to the customer. The transfer of goods to the customer and satisfaction of the Company’s performance obligation will
occur either at the time when products are shipped or when the products arrive and are received by the customer
depending on the shipping terms. No discounts are oﬀered by the Company as part of payment terms. The Company does
not provide an estimate for returns as there is no anticipation for any returns in the normal course of business.
 
Trade Accounts Receivable and Concentration Risk
 
The Company records accounts receivable at the invoiced amount and does not charge interest. The Company
reviews the accounts receivable by amounts due from customers which are past due to identify speciﬁc customers with
known disputes or collectability issues. In determining the amount of the reserve, the Company makes judgments about
the creditworthiness of signiﬁcant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations. The Company will also maintain a sales
allowance to reserve for potential credits issued to customers. The Company will determine the amount of the reserve
based on historical credits issued.
 
There was no provision for doubtful accounts recorded at December 31, 2022 and 2021. The Company recorded $0
in bad debt expense for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.
 
For the year ended December 31, 2022, one customer accounted for 100% of the Company’s net revenue.
 
For the year ended December 31, 2021, one customer accounted for 100% of the Company’s net revenue.
 
Inventory
 
Inventory is valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value using the ﬁrst-in, ﬁrst-out (FIFO) method. Inventory
on the balance sheet consists of raw materials purchased by the Company and ﬁnished goods.

Patents
 
Patents are stated on the balance sheet at cost. Costs, such as ﬁling fees with patent granting agencies and legal
fees directly relating to those ﬁlings, incurred to ﬁle patent applications were capitalized when the Company believed that
there was a high likelihood that the patent would be issued and there would be future economic beneﬁt associated with
the patent. These costs were amortized from the date of the patent application on a straight-line basis over the estimated
useful life of 10 years. All costs associated with any abandoned patent applications are expensed.
 
Accumulated amortization as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 was $4,050 and $0, respectively.
Amortization expense for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $4,050 and $0, respectively.

 Deferred Oﬀering Costs
 
Deferred oﬀering costs represent speciﬁc incremental costs directly attributable to the oﬀering of securities. The
deferred oﬀering costs are recorded as an oﬀset to additional paid-in capital and charged against the proceeds received.
 
Advertising and Marketing Costs
 
Advertising and marketing costs are expensed as incurred. The Company incurred $112,036 and $166,510 in
advertising and marketing costs during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
 
Shipping and Handling Costs
 
The Company includes shipping and handling cost as part of cost of goods sold.
 
Research and Development
 
The Company charges research and development costs to expense when incurred. The Company incurred $624,564
and $237,458 in research and development expenses during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
 
Stock-Based Compensation
 
The Company accounts for stock-based compensation under the provisions of ASC 718, Compensation-Stock
Compensation. Stock-based compensation expense for employees and non-employees is measured at the grant date fair

the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period.
 
Per Share Information
 
Basic earnings per share are calculated using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the
period presented. Diluted earnings per share is computed using the weighted-average number of common shares and, if
dilutive, potential common shares outstanding during the period. The dilutive eﬀect of potential common shares is not
reﬂected in diluted earnings per share because the Company incurred a net loss for the years ended December 31, 2022
and 2021 and the eﬀect of including these potential common shares in the net loss per share calculations would be anti-
dilutive.
 
The total potential common shares as of December 31, 2022 include 49,165,000 of restricted stock units, 2,338,832
shares for convertible notes payable – related parties and 925,887 shares for convertible notes payable. The total potential
common shares as of December 31, 2021 include 28,190,000 of restricted stock units.

Impairment of Long-lived Assets
 
The Company applies the provisions of ASC 360, Property, Plant and Equipment, where applicable to all long-lived
assets. ASC 360 addresses accounting and reporting for impairment and disposal of long-lived assets. The Company
periodically evaluates the carrying value of long-lived assets to be held and used in accordance with ASC 360. ASC 360
requires impairment losses to be recorded on long-lived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are
present and the undiscounted cash ﬂows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets’ carrying
amounts. In that event, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair market
value of the long-lived assets. Loss on long-lived assets to be disposed of is determined in a similar manner, except that
fair market values are reduced for the cost of disposal.
 
When equipment is sold or retired, the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts
and any gain or loss is included in the results of operations. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 the
Company determined its property and equipment should be impaired and $0 and $101,350 was written oﬀ, respectively.
 
Leases
 
The Company has elected not to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities that arise from short-term leases
for any class of assets.
 
New and Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
 
In August 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No.
ASU 2020-06, Debt—Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging—Contracts in
Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own
Equity, which simpliﬁes the accounting for certain ﬁnancial instruments with characteristics of liabilities and equity,
including convertible instruments and contracts on an entity’s own equity.
 
Under current GAAP, there are ﬁve accounting models for convertible debt instruments. ASU 2020-06 removes from
U.S. GAAP the separation models for (1) convertible debt with a cash conversion feature and (2) convertible instruments
with a beneﬁcial conversion feature. As a result, after adopting the ASU’s guidance, entities will not separately present in
equity an embedded conversion feature in such debt. Instead, they will account for a convertible debt instrument wholly
as debt, and for convertible preferred stock wholly as preferred stock (i.e., as a single unit of account), unless (1) a
convertible instrument contains features that require bifurcation as a derivative under ASC 815 or (2) a convertible debt
instrument was issued at a substantial premium. Additionally, for convertible debt instruments with substantial premiums
accounted for as paid-in capital, the FASB decided to add disclosures about (1) the fair value amount and the level of fair
value hierarchy of the entire instrument for public business entities and (2) the premium amount recorded as paid-in
capital.
 
ASU 2020-06 will be eﬀective for public business entities that meet the deﬁnition of a Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) ﬁler, excluding entities eligible to be smaller reporting companies as deﬁned by the SEC, for ﬁscal years
beginning after December 15, 2021, including interim periods within those ﬁscal years. For all other entities, the
amendments are eﬀective for ﬁscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, including interim periods within those ﬁscal
years. Early adoption is permitted, but no earlier than ﬁscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim
periods within those ﬁscal years. The Company adopted this accounting pronouncement on January 1, 2022 and it did not
have any impact to its ﬁnancial statements.
 
The Company considers all new pronouncements and management has determined that there have been no other
recently adopted or issued accounting standards that had or will have a material impact on its ﬁnancial statements.

On September 1, 2022, the Company entered into a common stock purchase agreement (the “CSPA”) with White
Lion Capital, LLC (“White Lion”). Pursuant to the CSPA, the Company has the right, but not the obligation, to require White
Lion to purchase up to $10,000,000 of the Company’s common stock, subject to certain limitations and conditions set forth
in the CSPA. The Company is required to register the resale of the shares issuable to White Lion under the CSPA with the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, as a condition to requesting White Lion purchase shares.  On September 7,
2022, we ﬁled a registration statement on Form S-3 to register for resale up to 15,000,000 common shares. The
Company’s S-3 registration statement was declared eﬀective by the SEC on September 19, 2022.
 
The Company’s right to sell shares to White Lion commenced on the eﬀective date of the resale registration
statement and extends for a period of three years. During this term, the Company may exercise its right to sell shares to
White Lion, subject to limitations on the amount of shares that are permitted to be sold with each exercise. The purchase
price to be paid by White Lion for such shares will equal 93% the lower of: (i) the volume-weighted average price of the
Company’s common stock during a period of ﬁve consecutive trading days following the Company’s exercise of its right to
sell shares, or (ii) the closing price of the common stock on the day the Company exercises its right to sell shares, subject
to a minimum price of $0.25 per share.
 
In consideration for White Lion’s commitment to purchase shares under the CSPA when requested, the Company
issued 757,576 shares to White Lion with a fair value of $250,000, as disclosed above.
 
The Company will have the right to terminate the CSPA at any time, at no cost or penalty, upon ten trading days
prior written notice. Additionally, White Lion will have the right to terminate the CSPA in accordance with its terms for
certain breaches of the CSPA by the Company, a Company bankruptcy ﬁling, or the Company’s CEO, Principal Financial
Oﬃcer or Director of Operations terminating their respective employment with the Company.
 
During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company sold 395,000 shares of common stock to White Lion and
received net proceeds of $72,395 after legal and administrative fees of $26,200 related to the CSPA were deducted, which

remaining $808,781 disgorgement settlement obligation with the SEC (Note 10). The aggregate amount of 2,228,115
shares of common stock were cancelled.
 
Share cancellations 2022
 
During the year ended December 31, 2022, 250,000 shares of common stock were returned to the Company for no
consideration, therefore the Company cancelled the shares, reducing common stock by $250 and increasing additional
paid-in capital by the same.
 
Restricted stock units
 
During the year ended December 31, 2020 the Board of Directors approved amendments to its March 25, 2019 RSU
Agreement for certain management and consultants to the Company.
 
The amendment resulted in 9,960,000 of the RSU’s vesting on January 1, 2021. The fair value of the 9,960,000
RSU’s was $7,071,600. The compensation expense was being amortized on a straight-line basis from the date of the
amendment through January 1, 2021 which is the vesting date. Stock-based compensation of $43,121 was recognized as
expense during the year ended December 31, 2021.
 
On January 6, 2021, the Board of Directors approved the second amendment to the Restricted Stock Unit Agreement
between the Company and Mr. Beplate, former Chief Executive Oﬃcer and current Chairman of the Board, in conjunction
with Mr. Beplate’s retirement from his day-to-day management role with the Company. The amendment accelerated the
vesting and immediately settled his remaining RSU’s by issuing 21,970,000 shares of common stock. Per ASC 718-20-35,
the change in vesting conditions resulted in a modiﬁcation of the stock-based compensation awards. The modiﬁcation is
considered a Type III modiﬁcation as described in ASC 718-20-55 and resulted in recording $23,947,300 of stock-based
compensation expense which was the fair value of the shares on the date of the modiﬁcation.

In April 2021, the Company entered into an RSU agreement with a service provider granting 750,000 RSU’s on the
date of the agreement and will grant an additional 750,000 RSU’s, upon the receipt by the Company of an FDA Class III
PMA. The 750,000 RSU’s had a grant date fair value of $664,875. The RSUs, subject to certain conditions, shall vest upon
the achievement of certain Company objectives and milestones which management is unable to determine when they will
be achieved therefore no compensation expense was recognized during the year ended December 31, 2021.
 
During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company terminated the services of one of its legal counsels who
had an RSU agreement in place. Per the RSU agreement, all of the unvested RSU’s owed to the legal counsel vested
immediately upon termination of services. This resulted in 325,000 shares of common stock being issued and $230,750 of
stock-based compensation being recorded which was the fair value of the shares on the original grant date of the RSU
agreement.
 
During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recorded the grant of 100,000 RSU’s to one of its legal
counsels and 35,000 of the RSU’s vested.  The vested RSU’s had a grant date fair value of $26,425 which was recorded as

As discussed in Note 3, Mr. Heaton was granted 500,000 RSU’s in December of 2020 and an additional 500,000
RSU’s in May of 2021. The vesting conditions are contingent upon the achievement of certain Company objectives and
milestones. During the year ended December 31, 2021, certain objectives were achieved which resulted in the vesting of
200,000 of RSU’s granted to Mr. Heaton. The 200,000 RSU’s had a grant date fair value of $220,000 which was recorded as
stock-based compensation expense.
 
As described above in Note 3, during the year ended December 31, 2022, the Board of Directors approved an RSU
Agreement in which Robert Denser, Director was granted 1,000,000 RSU’s which are subject to certain conditions and shall
vest upon the achievement of certain Company objectives and milestones. In addition, Mr. Thom’s original RSU Agreement
was amended. The amendment increased the amount of RSU’s granted from 11,500,000 to 13,225,000. The RSU’s are
subject to certain conditions and shall vest upon the achievement of certain Company objectives and milestones.

 Note 7. Accrued Litigation Settlement
 
On June 15, 2022, the Security and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) investigation of the Company, initially reported in
the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, was settled through the ﬁling of a
consent judgment without the Company admitting or denying the SEC’s allegations. As part of the settlement, the
Company is required to pay a civil penalty of $450,000, payable in four installments as follows:
 
  · $50,000 upon the entry of the judgment;
  · $100,000 within 90 days of the entry of the judgment;

 · $150,000 within 270 days of the entry of the judgment, plus statutory interest on payments made after 30 days
of the entry of the judgment pursuant to U.S.C. Section 1961
 
The Company made the initial scheduled payment of $50,000 and the second scheduled payment of $100,000
towards the civil penalty and as of December 31, 2022, the accrued litigation balance is $300,000.
 
Note 8. Litigation
 
A Complaint was ﬁled with the United States District Court, Southern District of New York by Steven Safran as
Plaintiﬀ against the Company and Douglas Beplate, its CEO, as Defendant. This case was transferred to the United States
District Court in Las Vegas, Nevada. Mr. Safran sought damages and monies allegedly owed pursuant to an employment
agreement of approximately $734,000 and allegedly unpaid loans of $245,824 provided to Defendants. The Company
denied the Plaintiﬀ’s allegations. On July 21, 2021, Mr. Safran and the Defendants entered into a Settlement Agreement
and General Release whereby the Company agreed to pay $250,000 in cash and issue 300,000 shares of common stock to
Mr. Safran. The 300,000 shares have a fair market value of $312,000. As of December 31, 2021, the 300,000 shares of
common stock have been issued and $250,000 in cash has been paid.
 
In March 2021, the Company received payment of $304,273 from Maxim Group LLC, representing the full settlement
payment in accordance with a Settlement Agreement in a previously disclosed arbitration between the Company and
Maxim that was reached in December 2019.
 
Philip Forman, who served as Chairman, a director, Chief Executive Oﬃcer and Chief Medical Advisor of the
Company at various times between 2011 and October 2015, ﬁled a lawsuit against the Company and our then-Chief
Executive Oﬃcer, Douglas Beplate, in the United States District Court of the District of Nevada. The plaintiﬀ has claimed,
among other things: that the June 25, 2015 Amendment to his November 10, 2014 Employment Agreement with the
Company, which terminated the Employment Agreement on October 1, 2015, is not enforceable due to lack of
consideration; that a July 22, 2015 Stock Purchase Agreement pursuant to which the plaintiﬀ sold Company shares issued
to him under the Amendment to a third a party is unenforceable (despite the fact that all payment for the shares under the
Stock Purchase Agreement was made); that the plaintiﬀ’s 2014 Employment Agreement remains valid and that he is
entitled to cash and stock compensation under that Employment Agreement (without giving regard to the Amendment);
and that the Company and Mr. Beplate defrauded the plaintiﬀ relating to the foregoing. The plaintiﬀ is seeking declaratory
judgment regarding the parties’ relative rights under the Employment Agreement, the Amendment and the Stock Purchase
Agreement; money damages of no less than $2,795,000; and punitive damages of $8,280,000. The Company ﬁled a
motion to dismiss the plaintiﬀ’s claims which was denied on March 19, 2020. On May 5, 2021, the plaintiﬀ provided a
deposition as instructed by the Court, subsequent to which the Company ﬁled a motion for dismissal of this proceeding. On
February 14, 2022, the Court issued an Order which declared the Amendment to be unenforceable and thus the terms of
the original Employment Agreement to remain in eﬀect. The Order also noted that the Company is not a party to the Stock
Purchase Agreement, and the Employment Agreement does not constitute a prior agreement that could have been
superseded by the Stock Purchase Agreement.
 
In July 2022, United Health Products ﬁled a motion to reopen discovery for the purpose of developing additional
issues it wished to raise at trial.  At the beginning of August 2022, the court denied United Health Products’ request to
reopen discovery.  The court instructed counsel for both parties to meet and confer regarding a Joint Trial Order to be ﬁled
with the court.  The Joint Trial Order generally details the parties’ position on which issues are to be addressed at trial.  The
parties are currently seeking to reach agreement on what issues should be addressed at trial.  Once the issues have been
agreed upon, the Joint Trial Order will be ﬁled with the court and the court will set a trial date.  Concurrently with the
completion of the Joint Trial Order, the parties are engaged in various settlement negotiations. 
 
In 2018, an action was commenced in the United States District Court Southern District of New York entitled JEC
Consulting Associates, LLC. Liquidator of Lead Dog Capital LP against United Health Products t/k/a United EcoEnergy Corp
and Douglas K. Beplate under Docket Number 18-cv-1139 (ER). The third-party action sought to remove a restrictive
legend from a particular stock certiﬁcate for Three Million Fifty Thousand (3,050,000) shares and declare the shares to be
free trading. The third-party plaintiﬀ alleges that the Company and Mr. Beplate refused to have the restrictive legend on
the stock certiﬁcate removed under Rule 144 and sought compensatory and punitive damages. The Federal court issued an
order that the Securities Exchange Commission should review the claim before the District Court renders a ﬁnal
ruling. Discovery appears to be substantially complete and settlement discussions between the third-party plaintiﬀ and
the Company have been initiated. On April 22, 2022 the parties entered in a Settlement Agreement wherein the Company
would agree to allow the removal of the restrictive legend as permitted under applicable securities laws and distribution of
the shares to aﬃliates of the plaintiﬀs. Under the Settlement Agreement the Company will make no payments other than
to pay expenses related to its own legal counsel.

As mentioned in Note 7 above, the Company settled the SEC’s investigation through the ﬁling of a consent
judgment on the terms described in the Company’s Form 8-K ﬁled on April 29, 2022, without the Company admitting or
denying the SEC’s allegations.
 
Due to uncertainties inherent in litigation, we cannot predict the outcome of the above legal proceedings.
 
The Company is or was also a party to the following legal proceedings:
 
On February 7, 2020, the Company ﬁled the Original Petition for Fraud and Breach of Contract in the Texas District

Patterson reached an agreement on settlement of Patterson’s counterclaim. The Company agreed to pay $120,000 which

In August 2020, United Health Products ﬁled suit against its former auditors, in Utah State Court, asserting claims
related to professional negligence and breach of ﬁduciary duty. The Company and the defendant, through mediation
reached an agreement on settlement in which the defendant agreed to pay $392,000 and the entire amount was paid in
September 2022 and recorded as other income in the statement of operations (Note 10).
 
Note 9. Income Tax
 
The Company accounts for income taxes under the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting
Standards Codiﬁcation (“ASC”) No. 740, Income Taxes (“ASC 740”). Under ASC 740, deferred tax assets and liabilities are
recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to diﬀerences between the ﬁnancial statement carrying amounts
of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using
enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary diﬀerences are expected to
be recovered or settled. Under ASC 740, the eﬀect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is
recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. 
 
The Company did not take any uncertain tax positions and had no adjustments to its income tax liabilities or
beneﬁts pursuant to the provisions of Section 740-10-25 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. The Company
recognizes interest accrued related to unrecognized tax beneﬁts in interest expense and penalties in operating expenses.
No such interest or penalties were recognized during the period presented. The Company had no accruals for interest and
penalties at December 31, 2022 or 2021.
 
The Company’s federal income tax returns for the years ended December 31, 2019 through December 31, 2022
remain subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service as of December 31, 2022.
 
During 2022 and 2021, the Company incurred net losses and, therefore, has no tax liability. The net deferred tax
asset generated by the loss carry-forward has been fully reserved.

price purchase notice at a time that the Company’s common stock is trading below $0.25 per share and White waives the

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
 
The Company needs to implement disclosure controls and procedures (as deﬁned in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ‘‘Exchange Act’’), that are designed to ensure that information required to be

Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
 
Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
ﬁnancial reporting, as such term is deﬁned in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. The Company’s
internal control over ﬁnancial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
ﬁnancial reporting and the preparation of ﬁnancial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Internal control over ﬁnancial reporting includes
those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reﬂect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of ﬁnancial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material eﬀect on the
interim or annual ﬁnancial statements.
 
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over ﬁnancial reporting may not prevent or detect
misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of eﬀectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls
may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with policies or procedures
may deteriorate.
 
The Chief Executive Oﬃcer and Principal Financial Oﬃcer assessed the eﬀectiveness of the Company’s internal
control over ﬁnancial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In performing its assessment of the eﬀectiveness of the
Company’s internal control over ﬁnancial reporting, management applied the criteria described in the Internal Control-
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (‘‘COSO -
2013’’).
 
A material weakness is a deﬁciency, or a combination of deﬁciencies, in internal control over ﬁnancial reporting,
such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company’s annual or interim ﬁnancial
statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
 
 
21
 
 
The material weaknesses identiﬁed during management’s assessment were the following:
 
 •Inadequate corporate governance
     
 •Inadequate internal control structure and control environment
     
 •Lack of information technology controls
     
 •Lack of segregation of duties
     
 •Limited accounting resources with SEC experience, US generally accepted accounting principles knowledge and
tax accounting expertise
 
These material weaknesses could result in a material misstatement of signiﬁcant accounts or disclosures that
would result in a material misstatement to the Company’s interim or annual ﬁnancial statements that would not be
prevented or detected.
 
Because of the material weaknesses, management concluded that the Company did not maintain eﬀective internal
control over ﬁnancial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on the criteria in Internal Control-Integrated Framework
issued by COSO -2013.
 
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
 
There were no reported changes in internal control over ﬁnancial reporting for the year ended December 31, 2022.

(1)FASB ASC Topic 718 requires the company to determine the overall full grant date fair value of the restricted stock
awards and options as of the date of grant based upon the Black-Scholes method of valuation which total amounts
are set forth in the table above under the year of grant, and to then expense that value over the service period over
which the restricted stock awards and options become vested. As a general rule, for time-in-service-based restricted
stock awards and options, the company will immediately expense any restricted stock awards and option or portion
thereof which is vested upon grant, while expensing the balance on a pro rata basis over the remaining vesting term
of the restricted stock awards and options. For a description FASB ASC Topic 718 and the assumptions used in
determining the value of the restricted stock awards and options under the Black-Scholes model of valuation, see the
notes to the ﬁnancial statements included with this Form 10-K.

section below entitled “Compensation Arrangements.”
 
No outstanding common share purchase option or other equity-based award granted to or held by any named

Stock Awards – Restricted Stock Units
 
During the year ended December 31, 2020 the Board of Directors approved amendments to its March 25, 2019 RSU
Agreement for certain management and consultants to the Company.
 
The amendment resulted in 9,960,000 of the RSU’s vesting on January 1, 2021. The fair value of the 9,960,000
RSU’s was $7,071,600. The compensation expense was being amortized on a straight-line basis from the date of the
amendment through January 1, 2021 which is the vesting date. Stock-based compensation of $43,121 was recognized as
expense during the year ended December 31, 2021.
 
On January 6, 2021, the Board of Directors approved the second amendment to the Restricted Stock Unit Agreement
between the Company and Mr. Beplate, former Chief Executive Oﬃcer and current Chairman of the Board, in conjunction
with Mr. Beplate’s retirement from his day-to-day management role with the Company. The amendment accelerated the
vesting and immediately settled his remaining RSU’s by issuing 21,970,000 shares of common stock. Per ASC 718-20-35,
the change in vesting conditions resulted in a modiﬁcation of the stock-based compensation awards. The modiﬁcation is
considered a Type III modiﬁcation as described in ASC 718-20-55 and resulted in recording $23,947,300 of stock-based
compensation expense which was the fair value of the shares on the date of the modiﬁcation.
 
                Mr. Heaton was granted 500,000 RSU’s in December of 2020 and an additional 500,000 RSU’s in May of 2021.
The vesting conditions are contingent upon the achievement of certain Company objectives and milestones. During the
year ended December 31, 2021, certain objectives were achieved which resulted in the vesting of 200,000 of RSU’s
granted to Mr. Heaton. The 200,000 RSU’s had a grant date fair value of $220,000 which was recorded as stock-based
compensation expense.
 
During the year ended December 31, 2022, Mr. Thom’s original RSU Agreement was amended. The amendment
increased the amount of RSU’s granted from 11,500,000 to 13,225,000. The RSU’s are subject to certain conditions and
shall vest upon the achievement of certain Company objectives and milestones. 
 
Compensation Agreements
 
Messrs. Thom and Heaton are being compensated at the monthly rate of $15,000 and $12,500 respectively,
pursuant to services agreements entered with each of them. Mr. Schiliro was being compensated at the monthly rate of
$15,000 pursuant to services agreement in his capacity as Chief Operating Oﬃcer until his resignation from that position
eﬀective on February 28, 2022. Mr. Schiliro remains in a non-oﬃcer position with the Company at the same rate of
compensation.

 Beneﬁcial ownership is determined in accordance with Rule 13d-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended, and is generally determined by voting powers and/or investment powers with respect to securities. Unless
otherwise noted, all of such shares of common stock listed above are owned of record by each individual named as
beneﬁcial owner and such individual has sole voting and dispositive power with respect to the shares of common
stock owned by each of them. Such person or entity’s percentage of ownership is determined by assuming that any
options or convertible securities held by such person or entity, which are exercisable within sixty (60) days from the

On August 8, 2013, the Board of Directors approved the 2013 Employee Beneﬁt and Consulting Services
Compensation Plan (the “2013 Plan”) which had 15,000,000 shares that may be issued under said Plan. The 2013 Plan
provides for the direct issuance of shares of common stock and the granting of non-statutory stock options on terms
established by the Board of Directors or committee thereof. While the Plan provides for incentive stock options, no
incentive stock options may be granted under the Plan since no stockholder approval was obtained on or before August 8,
2014. In September 2013, the Company issued 6,000,000 shares of stock under the 2013 Plan to the Company’s former
CEO Douglas Beplate pursuant to his consulting agreement then in eﬀect. No other shares or options have been granted

provides for the direct issuance of shares of common stock and the granting of non-statutory stock options or incentive
stock options on terms established by the Board of Directors or committee thereof. The Plan has not been approved by the
Company’s stockholders. The Company approved the issuance of 1,525,000 shares in November 2019 to certain persons
who were then consultants, oﬃcers and directors. The Company has not issued any options under this 2019 Plan.
 
Separate from the 2013 Plan and 2019 Plan, the Board of Directors has approved individual Restricted Stock Unit
Agreements with certain consultants, oﬃcers and directors (including now former oﬃcers and directors) which represent
an unvested aggregate amount of 47,665,000 and 28,190,000 as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, which upon
vesting will result in the issuance of common shares. These include RSUs issued to oﬃcers and directors (including now
